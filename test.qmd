## R vs. Python for Data Science
- We ought to learn both... 
- R probably best at tabular data (manipulation, plotting)
- Nice comparison at statology.org:

::: notes
R used to be a highly specialized language for statistical computing unlike general programming languages such as Python. Its main advantage was vectorization: the ability to perform the same operation on all elements (e.g. table rows) simultaneously. Computer processors in 1990s could normally not do it, the general-purpose languages had to introduce a loop. With modern processors, general-purpose languages can vectorize many operations and R accrued functionalities of a general-purpose language. R possibly (still) better at data science. For application programming, use Python. Most important: use what your scientific community uses and supports with libraries.

## Base R

::: notes

:::
2. Base R: the original core. 
Data structures:

R works with (series of) single observations (vectors and matrices), tables (aka data frames), and lists that can contain any combinations of those, including other lists. 

Class: The observations can be either numbers or strings, or Boolean values (TRUE/FALSE). In vectors and matrices all elements must be of the same class. In a column (in a data frame), all observations must also belong to the same class.   
:::

## Base R

-   descriptive statistics
-   plots

```{r}
observations <- runif(n = 1000, min = 0, max = 1)
```

## Base R
```{r}
summary(observations)
```


```{r}
plot(observations)
```

## Current R

-   Data wrangling
-   Format conversions (XML, HTML, JSON, ...)
-   Web scraping
-   API communication
-   Dynamic, interactive visualization
-   Reporting, publishing
-   Interoperable with

Data science: making sense of data. around statistics & visualization.
