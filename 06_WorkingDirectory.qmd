## Working directory {.smaller}

-   folder from which R sees other files and folders

</br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![Interactive control of Working Directory location](images_ATRIUM/Programming_11_WorkingDirectory.png){#Programming_11_WorkingDirectory}
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
Print path to your current Working Directory

```{r}
getwd()
```

Set a different Working Directory

```{r}
#| eval: false
setwd("~/folder/subfolder/") # ~ means your home
```
:::
:::

## Let's have a common file path {.smaller}

1.  Make sure that your Working directory is your home.

2.  Create a new folder in your home. Call it `R_BEGINNERS_SHORT`.

    Enter that folder. Make it your Working Directory. (Gear icon $\rightarrow$ `Set As Working Directory`.

3.  Create new folders `datasets_ATRIUM` and `my_output_files`.

In the `File` tab, select `New project` $\rightarrow$ `In an existing directory`, and pick `R_BEGINNERS_SHORT`.

::: notes
If you execute this procedure, you will not need to adapt file paths in the teaching materials to your user account, except perhaps the user account name.

  destfile = "datasets_ATRIUM/gapminder_hourly_labour_cost_constant_2017_usd--by--geo--time.csv"
  )
```

::: notes
The `download.file` function is universal to download any file from anywhere. Sometimes you can copy a download link from a website and use this URL to download the file programmatically.

This is how to download some data from GitHub, which is a bit specific. Here I work with data from Gapminder on Github. Their repository is very large and this was a largely random pick: `https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf–gapminder–systema_globalis/tree/master/countries-etc-datapoints`. This repository contains a table that explains each data set, but I am going to select one that is intelligible without reading much metadata. It is going to be a table about average labor cost in a given country in a given year: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-numbers/ddf–gapminder–systema_globalis/refs/heads/master/countries-etc-datapoints/ddf–datapoints–hourly_labour_cost_constant_2017_usd–by–geo–time.csv>

Manually navigate to the file you want and copy its URL. Mind to use the URL that appears when you hit the `Raw` button ( starting with `https://raw.githubusercontent`) to download the contents of the file. On the default `https://github.com/….` you would only download a html file of the website you are seeing.

Use the `download.file` function. Leave all arguments at default, except `url` and `destfile`. Put the file into the new empty `datasets_ATRIUM` folder. Use the end part of the original file name and give it a prefix `gapminder_` and keep doing this with all files that you happen do download from this source. This will help you keep a system in your files.
