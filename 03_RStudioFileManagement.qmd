## File explorer in RStudio's bottom right pane

![Four panes in RStudio](images_ATRIUM/RStudio_01_FourPanes.png){#RStudio_01_FourPanes}

::: notes
All around interactive file management happens in the bottom right RStudio pane, the `Files` tab.

## Upload from your computer to Jupyterlab RStudio

![](images_ATRIUM/RStudio_02_UploadFileFromYourPC.png){#RStudio_02_UploadFileFromYourPC .Interactive .upload .to .RStudio .on .Jupyterlab}

::: notes
You can upload files to the cloud from your local computer. Use the `Upload` button. The upper field in the dialog box navigates you through the file system on Jupyterlab. The `Browse…` button will take you to your local file system.

**NB!** ⚠️You can only upload one file at a time. If you need to upload several files or a folder, you have to pack them into a `.zip` file. Jupyterlab RStudio will automatically unzip it.

## Download from Jupyterlab RStudio to your computer

::: notes
Check the file(s) on Jupyterlab in the explorer. Hit the `More` menu (the one with the gear icon) and select `Export...`. If you have selected more than one file, RStudio will export the batch as a zip file.

## UFAL Linux Network

::: notes
Do not make this a big deal because you will probably not use Jupyterlab RStudio in your personal work setup after this course. But you could benefit from a basic orientation in the system.

Jupyterlab is installed on a computational grid called AIC (Artificial Intelligence Cluster).
