1	Abann	South Sudan	New Zealand	A	O	far	1421	43972	H	im	male	"In 2005, I arrived in Auckland, New Zealand. I came with my two daughters and my lovely wife, Mary. We stayed in a resettlement centre for six weeks and received an orientation programme organised by the New Zealand government. When I moved into the community, I realised that things were not going to be as easy as I thought. I was faced with the reality of resettlement challenges. It was very hard to understand and navigate basic resettlement issues, such as neighbourhood connections, networking and access to available services. Fortunately, there were government and NGOs support services such as NZ Red Cross volunteer programmes to deal with some of the these challenges. The place that made me love New Zealand was Mangere Bridge Mountain. I used to go to this mountaintop every day, to enjoy the views of Auckland. I loved it because it gave me a sense of belonging and I knew I wanted to stay in New Zealand. I had previously lived for some time in Damascus, Syria, and I was Secretary General for the South Sudanese Community and Chairman of the Shilluk community. I came to New Zealand with the same spirit. I actively engaged the South Sudanese community members to create activities that could reduce isolation and loneliness in the community and encouraged others to get to know one another. The first administrative work I did in support of community members was to organise a World Refugee Day celebration on June 20, 2006. It was a very successful event, which saw the establishment of the Auckland South Sudanese Soccer Team. It was because of such events that South Sudanese community members saw the need to continue engaging with one another. I was chosen to lead the community, but I chose to serve in the capacity of deputy chairman on the grounds that I was new to New Zealand. As a deputy chairman I established a lot of networking with the Auckland Resettlement Sectors. Our community became a member of the Auckland Resettled Community Coalition (ARCC) in 2006. We received funding and I ran a parental program for five years, as well as introducing a healthy eating and healthy living campaign and youth programmes. In 2011 after graduating with a graduate diploma in non-for-profit management, I worked as a youth worker for nearly four years with the Resettlement Youth Action Network (RYAN). My roles there were to help young people find jobs and to help them with appropriate education plans (Pathway). Then in 2013, I was elected Chairperson of ARCC. Currently, I am the General Manager, of ARCC after four years of positive development from a volunteer organisation to one that can pay staff. I am now considering studying again for a Masters degree in community development. I want to keep my fathers dream alive; he wanted me to get a quality education before he departed this earth. I want readers to learn something from my story. I want to advise those who are struggling with jobs and life in general to pause and check the missteps. Help yourself first in order to find someone else who can help you. At this point in my journey, I am proud to have achieved successful outcomes throughout my struggle for a better life. I feel that I am indeed walking in the shoes of my father and keeping his dream alive."
2	Abass Senghore	Gambia	Libya	A	A	close	757	4243	H	im	male	I left the country in late 2015. I was going to school at the time, attending the tenth grade. With a big family to provide for, my father could not pay for the fees for all of us. Life was not easy. I left The Gambia via Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and then to Libya. I spent a long time on the backway journey. It took me about a year and three months before I could reach Tripoli. I had to work along the journey to pay for my transit from one country to another, because I did not have enough money. When I arrived in Libya, I stayed over six months in the city of Tripoli. On the journey, I experienced a lot: hunger, sleeplessness, ill treatment. Honestly, I didnt know about all these risks before departure. When I returned, I went back to tailoring. This is what I was doing before departure. I was earning something at the end of the day, and I was proud of this. My mom, dad and some of my friends were really excited to see me again – and to see me alive. This proved to be the most important thing for me. Through my reintegration assistance, I was provided with sewing machines. The proceeds from the sewing allow me to financially support my family and myself. As a returnee, I did not actually expect everyone to welcome me with open arms. As I anticipated, some people were looking at me as if I had failed. Now that I returned, I will never embark on the journey again. What I went through has taught me a lesson. Now that we have faced COVID-19 this year, it has affected my business a lot. Before the pandemic, business was booming. There were lots of events and ceremonies. People were always buying new clothes and I had a lot of customers. I used to make a lot of money, which I used to pay for my rent, provide for my family and myself. Now, I have very little or almost no customers, and I am making very little income. As a young tailor, it has been crucial to safeguard my business. I tried to make t-shirts to sell them, but that has not been very lucrative as tailoring. Nonetheless, this is also better than not earning anything at all. Recently, around last year, I started doing music. Prior to this, I always had a passion for it. I did a song with my friends. We were motivated by our successful participation in a skills training programme at YMCA. I did another collaboration song with my fellow Migrants as Messengers (MaM) volunteers. The song is called No to Stigma, and in the song we talk about the need to come together as one and fight the coronavirus.
3	Abba	Togo	Niger	L	A	far	863	568	E	im	male	You will rarely see a Togolese leave his country. If he leaves, it means he had a good reason to do so. When I first reached Niger ten years ago, I wasnt planning on staying. I thought I would continue my journey onwards to Libya or Algeria, but I eventually decided to stay and work as a mechanic. I soon realized that I wasnt the only Togolese in Arlit so I got in touch with the mayor and asked him if we could create a Togolese association. Once he agreed, we officially announced it on the radio and managed to assemble close to 200 Togolese brothers and sisters. I have been the president of this association ever since. One day, I heard IOM was looking for third-country nationals to work as community mobilizers. In the beginning, I was a bit nervous, but the colleagues were very supportive. They told me: Go on, Abba! Its your job now!. Migrants sometimes think we are there to force them to go back so they can be a bit apprehensive in the beginning until they understand we are only there to talk and that the assistance is voluntary. I enjoy discussing with migrants and understanding the reasons that pushed them to leave their countries. Sometimes, they just want to be heard, and I am more than happy to do it. I have learned a lot about migration and about how to communicate since. In the beginning, I used to easily get discouraged when migrants refused to talk to me, but now I know how to better approach them. I keep in touch with a lot of the migrants I have referred to the transit centre. A lot of them call me once they are back to thank me. Its encouraging to hear words like this after meeting them in the ghettos and seeing the situations they were going through. A lot of Togolese sisters have left the ghettos in Arlit thanks to our discussions. I go back to Togo every year, and nowadays I go back with my head held up high! We will see what happens with time, but for now, I am happy with my life in Niger. IOMs outreach activities through its four Orientation Offices in Niger are supported by the European Union and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), under the Migrant Resource and Response Mechanism (MRRM).
4	Abbas and his family	Iraq	Greece	M	E	far	4146	18117	E	im	male	Midway, the boat started to take on water and soon it came to a halt. We were absolutely frightened, Abbas recounts of the perilous sea crossing between Turkey and Greece back in March 2016. Thankfully, the Greek coast guard came to the rescue and the refugees were taken to Alexandroupolis, northern Greece. It took one month for Abbas, his wife Sirwa and their two children, Mohamad and Tina, to make it from their native Kirkuk, Iraq, to the Turkish coast. A combination of local tribal conflicts and the presence of ISIS forces meant that fleeing was the Kurdish familys only option. Like so many others, they were hoping to reach Germany, France or Belgium. However, by the time they arrived in Greece, the European borders were closing fast. They had to re-evaluate their situation. We got word about the relocation programme by fellow refugees. Two months after our arrival, we moved to Athens, in an apartment, waiting to be relocated, says Abbas. Now, the big day has come and the family is ready to move to Norway. At the question of how do they feel about it, Abbas face brightens up in a split second: We are so glad! he exclaims. I was a blacksmith in Iraq and hopefully Ill be able to get a similar job in Norway. All we want is a calm, safe life. And education for our children. But the Greeks have been very nice to us, too, his wife Sirwa adds. And we are really satisfied with IOMs help all the way through the process of relocation. Her son, 10-year-old Mohamad, interrupts her – in Greek: I like that we are going to Norway, I want to go to school. I have only been to school here in Greece and I love maths! His mother comments that its football that he loves the most and Mohamad giggles as the family poses for a photo.
5	Abdalrahman	Rwanda	Burundi	A	A	close	798	286	E	im	male	My name is Abdalrahman, and I was born in Burundi even though my family is originally from Gisenyi, the border area with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Rwanda. My father came to Burundi with my grandfather and my uncle in 1959 to escape the war. They were cattle breeders, and brought their livestock with when they came here. Their wish was always to go back to Rwanda. When my grandfather came back to Rwanda after the war, in 1961, he was killed. So my father decided to stay in Burundi, and my family settled in the North Eastern part of the country. My father only briefly went back to Rwanda in 1994 after the genocide, and found out that all of our family that had stayed there were dead. I am married, I have three children, and I have been working for international organizations for years. I have lived my whole life in Burundi. I feel very connected to Rwanda and my aim is to go back. But first I want to go to Gisenyi to find traces of my family, and when the time comes I want to settle in Rwanda with my family.
6	Abdalsalams family	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	n	When the war arrived in our city, Deir Ez-Zor, we started moving from place to place around Syria up until it became too difficult and too dangerous to be there. We left our homeland for Turkey, where we spent 3 years, living in a camp close to the border with Syria. The location meant that we never lost contact with the war, we could see the bombings and hear the shelling on the other side of the border. Mentally, nothing had improved for us and physically, for three years, we were sharing a small tent between six persons. An ordeal, it was. The living conditions at the camp and the fact that our children didnt have a chance to further their education in Turkey, made me and my wife take the decision to leave for Europe. We crossed to Greece on a rubber boat, we stared into the face of death but we managed to arrive on the island of Lesvos. It was February 2016. The Greek people have been really supportive to us during a difficult time, this is a memory that will stay. The worst part in Greece was the time we spent at the northern border, at the makeshift camp of Idomeni. There was no electricity, we were sleeping on the ground, the toilets were a mess and we could only cook on a fire, in the open. After seven months we moved to the accommodation centre of Koutsohero, close to Larissa in central Greece, which was a vast improvement for us. We left Koutsohero only last night and arrived here directly. Tomorrow, we will fly to the Netherlands. We have friends and family in the Netherlands, so we are happy that we will relocate there. My wifes siblings have relocated there about 2.5 months ago under the same EU scheme and we can hardly wait to meet them again. Our family says that the people of the Netherlands are kind to them, they treat them fairly and they are happy. I used to be a farmer in Syria and I hope I will be able to find something similar to do in the Netherlands, I know that it has a very strong agricultural sector. My wife is a teacher and we have four children together: Noor is 20 years old and she wishes to attend university. Ammar, my boy, is 18 and the twins, Bashar and Manar, are 13. The main thing for us is to finally have a sense of stability. We have been emotionally scarred by the war, the slightest noise makes us jump from our seats. For our young daughter it is even worse, she suffers from severe psychological trauma and she needs assistance. Furthermore, we wish that our children will be able to finally go back to school and as for us, we hope to find a job to be able to support them. It is very important to have some stability in life. Without it, how can one make plans for the future and set goals?.
7	Abdalwahab	Sudan	Libya	A	A	close	1415	4243	E	im	male	In 1986, I got a job in Benghazi, where I stayed for 11 years before moving back to Sudan. No one chooses to leave their country, but circumstance sometimes makes its own rules. So, you always carry your identity no matter where you go. But on the other side, I did well and I got married in 1990. My wife moved to Benghazi with me. We enjoyed staying in Benghazi, as there was a Sudanese community there as well. Afterwards, I moved back to Sudan and spent another five years there. Then again, I found myself looking for another job abroad. And since I had lived in Libya before, I wanted to come back. In 2002, I got a job in Tripoli and I moved here alone. I only went back home every other year. Life was good, and I was getting good benefits from my job. But since 2011, things have changed. Now we are lacking lots of items in the unit. We try our best to help patients: after all, helping them is our job. If you can help a person, that will make you go home happy.
8	Abdel	Egypt	Italy	A	E	far	3609	31238	H	im	male	"Abdel came to Italy after the shop he was running in Sharm El Sheik was destroyed by a bomb; he decided to move to Italy where he had studied previously on an exchange program.  But once in Rome, he couldnt find work for over 8 months. It didnt feel right because I have always been working since I was a child. Although I have a degree, and I have studied for 16 years, I couldnt find a job in my field. So I started to work as driver and a doorman for a hotel in the center of Rome. However, I think it is very important to never give up hope and to try to do our best to build a future. Jobs will not come knocking at your door for you. Soon he was able to market his skills and experiences in a new way: I had the opportunity to go to Lampedusa, an island off of southern Italy, as a cultural mediator for the state police. I have heard so many stories from the people I hosted in Lampedusa, and experienced first-hand the way they live in the reception centers where I was working. There are a lot of differences between an interpreter and a cultural mediator: the first one only translates the language, but the mediator actually has to mediate and facilitate migrants transition to the new culture. People might do or say something that is perceived as an insult by others. For instance, an Italian policeman tried to imitate the Muezzins call to prayer; he did not do it to offend Muslims, but for some it was seen as an insult. The policeman apologized. Also, often I had to reassure some migrants about the food they were given, since they were scared they might eat pork. I think about life as a journey, and I need it to end where it began. I dont know when, but I will go back home one day. Not because I failed here, but just because I will need to return to where I was born."
9	Abdel and his family	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	male	It was a very difficult journey. We left Aleppo because of the war. War is a bad thing, there was death, fear, misery. I was conscripted to fight for the regime, so we took the decision to flee. I didnt not want to have blood in my hands, to take another mans life. They cannot make me do that. When living in Syria, before the war, I had a good job. I was a skilled worker, making plasterboards, fitting wirings, usually for businesses, hotels or private homes. Amina, my wife, took up the upbringing of our children. It was the journey of death, this is what we call it. Either way, staying in Syria would mean that wed die. So, we took the risk, either wed survive or wed be gone. I undertook a tremendous risk, not only for myself, but also for my wife and my children. But, if wed managed to make it, wed have won a life far from the war.  To us, it will always be the journey of death. We crossed from Turkey to the island of Lesbos by boat, just like everyone else. Another difficult journey awaited, this time from camp to camp. From Lesbos, we went to Kavala, then to Herso, from there to Katerini and then to Thessaloniki until finally we settled in Athens. Weve been through rough times but weve also had nice experiences. Weve seen beautiful places but the worst part was the bad weather, when it as rainy or cold, or when it was very hot. Nevertheless, amidst all these hardships, we were always surrounded by really nice people who helped us and who well never forget. In the meantime, Amina got pregnant. Since she gave birth to our baby daughter Isra, things are easier, shes 6 months old now. I cannot describe what relocating to France feels like. We are so happy, well start again, we ll find stability. Our life will be just like before the war, or even better. Im certain that a new life awaits, the children will go to school, which is the most important thing for them. I dont know where well settle yet, but I dream of living in Nice, what a beautiful city! I wish that well love France and that France will love us back. Weve already started learning French, not only with the help of IOM and the French Embassy but also at home, on our own, thanks to online courses. In France, well try to leave behind us all that weve been through, we already try to help the children forget. We dont want them to talk about it all, or ever go through such an experience again. We two, well never forget, how can one forget such a thing. Our life was unbearable. But the children are still very young, at 9 and 6, so maybe in the end they wont remember a thing.
10	Abdelhak	Morocco	Morocco	A	A	close	3108	3108	E	hc	male	"I  went to Belgium to improve my living conditions. For me, this meant finding a home or buying a car. But living abroad was not easy, and after several unsuccessful attempts of regularization, I decided to go back to Morocco. Migrants are expected to come back with a certain success; it was not easy. But thanks to my experience, and with the support I received upon return, I set up a small bakery business. However, after a few months, despite good feedback from my customers, I felt that this activity would not be profitable enough in the long term. I took a closer look at the market, and I concluded that selling sewing accessories would be a more sustainable option. I therefore invested my gains into this new activity. I feel like a real entrepreneur and I am confident to take appropriate risks to develop my business. I am now reassured about the stability of my situation."
11	Abdellatif	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	male	"For 28 years, Abdellatif worked as a civil engineer building the infrastructure in what was once considered one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Ive built schools, banks, power stations and roads, but the thing Im most proud of: Ive build some of the highest buildings and towers in Syria; before the war of course. How much of what I have built has been destroyed? I may never know. Each building, each structure was a part of me. How much of me still survives in Syria? In 2013, a year into the conflict in Syria, Abdellatif fled to Egypt where he lived for nearly two years. Like millions of people fleeing violence and conflict, he dreamt of a better life reuniting with his family. When I saw the thousands of migrants and refugees safely arriving in Europe, I thought maybe I too can see my daughter and my brother again. They live in Sweden. With little more than hope, Abdellatif journeyed to Turkey, expecting to then cross into Europe. Once in Turkey, his planned changed, but not his dreams. The most important thing to me is my childrens future. I have nine children, seven girls and two boys. I want them all to be happy, to be safe and to get an education. Modern society requires education. One of my children is a doctor, another is a dentist and two are still in university. It was at one of his childrens schools in Istanbul that Abdellatif first heard of a community center supported by IOM. One day a teacher mentioned to me that this community center has Turkish lessons. The first and the most difficult problem of living in Turkey is that I dont speak the language. Culturally, Turkish and Syrian people are close, but the language barrier makes it difficult to do the everyday tasks and to find work. I want to build things again. One of the scariest things I face now is that I have no idea what the future will bring. Theres no stability, but with my Turkish lessons and the legal advice at the community center, Im beginning to set up life here in Turkey.   Abdellatif is one of several Syrians attending an IOM-supported community centre in Istanbul providing language courses, legal assistance, vocational training, conflict management and socio-cultural activities."
12	Abdellatif	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	male	Abdellatif had lived a typically comfortable life with his wife and children before the war erupted in Syria. Every morning he would wake up, eat breakfast and go to work. After putting in a full day at the office, he would return home for some family time or watch a little television. This was his daily routine. He was a typical civil servant in a comfortable government job. Five years ago, that typical normality was lost as Abdellatifs life veered in a different direction beyond his control. The conflict in Syria changed everything. His once comfortable life became a struggle. Little things that most people take for granted, like water and electricity, were no longer available. How does one cook dinner for a family in an apartment with no water or electricity? The lack of basic services was just the tip of the iceberg. Bombardments rocked the neighborhood, favorite restaurants or local markets became a pile of rubble, basic food items were difficult to find and when they could – it was prohibitively expensive. After surviving like this for two years, Abdellatif was forced to make one of the most difficult decisions in his life. Returning home from work one day, he found his apartment destroyed. Frantically, he searched for his family. After a nerve wracking search, a neighbour eventually told him where to find his family and thankfully they were all safe. Terrified for the safety of his family, afraid for their future, Abdellatif decided their only chance was to flee. For them, that meant Turkey. However, Abdellatif was a government employee, meaning if he left he would be considered a defector. His presence could therefore endanger his whole familys lives. It is with this knowledge that Abdellatif weighed the risks and decided to send his family ahead of him to Turkey with the help of smugglers – never knowing for sure if he would ever see them again. For weeks, he waited anxiously for news that his family made it safely to Turkey. Finally, when that news came, it was his turn. As I was waiting for word of my familys safe arrival in Turkey, fighting broke out in my neighborhood. I was wounded by a stray bullet, but that only reinforced my determination. The risks were high. When I didnt show up for work, I became a defector. The punishment, well, I dont want to think about what would have happened. By myself, I made the slow, long journey hiding. Once in Turkey, Abdellatif had a joyous reunion with his family. For over two years, he lived in Turkeys relative safety. Life was not easy, but it was better than in conflict stricken Syria. However Abdellatif – only 47 years old – still felt he had work left to do. He didnt want to live like a refugee. He wanted to work and provide for his family. After years of living day-to-day, working irregularly when he could, Abdellatif was informed his family had been selected for resettlement. Ive never been as happy as when I heard we had been selected for resettlement. I know some Syrian families who have already resettled where we are going. They told me about the country and about what is expected. I think we can happily live there.   Abdellatif and his family were part of the 5,000 Syrians IOM Turkey helped to resettle during the first six months of 2016. There are currently 2.7 million registered Syrians living in Turkey.
13	Abdelsater	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	male	Abdelsater and his family of eight are hopeful they will be counted as among the 25,000 Syrian refugees who are migrating to Canada in the next months. He shares his story at the Canadian resettlement facility in Amman, Jordan. We have been in Irbid, Jordan for more than three years now, and it feels like our life has been paused since we arrived. My father was a chef, and for many years in Homs I had a shawarma shop with my brother. Since the war broke out in Syria, and we had to leave to Irbid, I havent been able to practice my trade. We had to move out of town because the rent was too expensive and my children had to leave school. We were so relieved when we heard we had the chance to go to Canada. On the news, we see so many people dying while crossing the Mediterranean in boats. They will do anything to get to Europe and have a second chance at life. This way seems much better: to be able to go legally and by airplane. We saw people on television in Canada demanding that their government take in refugees like us.It shows the generosity of the Canadian people. We think of Canada as a parent who is taking care of children and keeping the family together. As Syrians, we can be respected and taken care of by an organized effort that will help us reach safety. We dont have to throw ourselves in a boat and risk death to take our chance of a new life. I dont want to beg anyone. I look forward to finding work in Canada, doing whatever I can to give back. Before the war, we were dignified in our country. I strongly feel that this process gives us a sense of dignity we havent had since we left Syria. I know life will be difficult at first in our new home, but we will learn English and do our best to adapt. My children can go to school again and have a good future.
14	Abdi	Somalia	United States	A	N	far	118	63123	H	im	male	Abdi left his home in Mogadishu in 1992, when he was only 12 years old. He went to Kenya with his sister after his father died in the war and his mother chose to stay in Somalia. Spending most of his life in Kenya, Abdi says he feels like more of a Kenyan than a Somali. Abdi and his sister lived in Dadaab refugee camp in northern Kenya. We lived the normal refugee life, Abdi says. We often had to go to school with no shoes and barely one meal a day. In 2005, Abdi moved to Nairobi where he got to finish his schooling and earn a college degree in human resources with the support of a scholarship. However, after graduation he found it hard to find a job, particularly given his uncertain legal status. He worked casual jobs and eventually opened a small shop selling vegetables and fruits. In 2014, he had to return to Dadaab but ended up finiding his way back to Nairobi. After a while, unable to return to Somalia and finding it increasingly difficult to stay in Nairobi, Abdi applied and was granted resettlement assistance. Abdi is now moving to Portland, Oregon, a world away from the dangers of Mogadishu. He has friends there and will get sponsored by a catholic charity when he arrives. He is eager to start his new life, seeing many possibilities ahead of him, and has already started researching possible employers.
15	Abdikani	Somalia	South Africa	A	A	close	118	5094	H	im	male	I decided to go back to Mogadishu because I thought I would die and I did not want to be a burden to my wife and the community in Cape Town where I lived for one year. Now I am hopeful that soon I will see my little girls and I will be able to play and laugh with them. In June 2009, Abdikani began his journey of hope from Mogadishu to Cape Town, South Africa through Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. The three day treacherous journey was nothing he could have ever imagined. Little did he know it would take a toll on his health in the long run. The journey was perilous as he and others gave up everything for a new chance of life in the Promised Land, away from hunger and conflict in their home country. Together with his colleagues, Abdikani didnt have proper documentation and they had to be smuggled through the Kenyas border town of Liboi. After the arduous journey that lasted for eleven days, he reached Cape Town – at last his dream could be fulfilled. He found refuge in a township predominantly dominated by the Somali community. A few days later, lady luck smiled on him and he was offered a job in a local kiosk. Everything seemed to be going well for Abdikani, his wife and two daughters. His life was on track and nothing could interfere with his goal of being the best husband and father. I adore my children and nothing in this world could stop me from being with them. Not even TB. When I started feeling sick in 2013 I did not think it would be this serious. I thought it was because of the change in weather. Cape Town can be very cold in winter and since I was not used to this in Somalia, it must have affected me. He went to a health facility where he was diagnosed with TB and was started on treatment for six months but unfortunately, his health seemed to deteriorate even further. After six months of medication I was still not feeling well, the symptoms got worse I was sweating profusely, the headaches and the coughing became worse. His friends and relatives feared for his life and advised that he go back home to Somalia, basically to die. They lost all hope and he yearned to see his parents before his death. After some fundraising within the community Abdikani flew home and was received by his parents at the airport in Mogadishu. Weak and exhausted, he could not say much. Upon the insistence of his mother, Abdikani sought a second opinion from a well-known physician and underwent a series of tests including giving a sample of sputum and smear culture which are the standard TB tests. When he went back to get the results, he was dumb struck as he was informed he had contracted the Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MD-RTB) bacteria. The doctor then advised him to go to the IOM MDR-TB center in Dadaab Refugee Camp in Kenya as there was no health facility within Somalia that could treat the bacteria. Desperate and feeling hopeless, Abdikani, though very weak travelled over 714 km from Mogadishu to Dadaab, Kenya in search of lifesaving treatment. On reaching the health facility he presented the results and tests were done afresh. On confirmation of the previous test results, he was started on medication immediately. The nurse in charge, Mohammed Abdi Hassan said, In the three months that Abdikani has been here, he has made tremendous progress, he has gained considerable weight and his sputum results are continuing to show a lot of improvement. He has been very cooperative and comes for his oral medication and injection on time. We believe he will fully recover and go back to his family. I am counting the days to my full recovery, my wife is very happy and my daughters are now able to talk, they ask me when I am going back or if they can come visit me here. I can only tell them that I will be home soon. That is the only promise I can make.
16	Abdoulaye	Senegal	Germany	A	E	far	1458	45909	H	im	male	I lived in Senegal until I was 17.  I miss the mosques calls five times a day. It is like the bells of a church, it shapes your daily life. I also miss the smooth, stress-free way of living. You can visit a friend without having to coordinate.  Its pretty spontaneous. After studying German for nine months, I moved to Berlin to study Political Science and Law.  I really like the Christmas market here in Berlin, and I miss it when I am abroad during the holiday season. However, sometimes cultural differences lead to funny situations. For example, in my country, when women gain weight they are happy about it. If you tell them that they have grown fatter, it is a compliment. In the first year of university my flatmate put on some weight and it was beautiful. I remember telling her, Oh! That is lovely, you gained some weight. I didnt realise at first, but she wasnt very happy with what I thought had been a compliment. We are all different, but if we do not get beyond our differences it will be a disaster. Muslims like me have to work together to get our community under control because extremists are trying to destroy what took centuries to build: a beautiful civilization, beautiful traditions, peace and love. Now terrorist attacks are more visible than the beauty of our community. There is a lot of work to be done. Nations need to be resilient to continue co-existing. There is not a national solution for terrorism. Instead, it requires a collaborative and international approach.
17	Abdoulie	Gambia	Libya	A	A	close	757	4243	H	im	male	"I dont think about the backway anymore. I just want to work and make my kids, my wife and my parents proud. When I left The Gambia in March 2015, I didnt tell anyone— not even my wife. I was worried it would bring a lot of confusion in the family. I was working as a tailor before I left, but things werent going well. I had two kids to support and my parents depended on me. The responsibility was too much on my plate. I had only reached Tambacounda, Senegal, when I was left with no money. I had to call my family, who were not happy with the decision I made. I asked them to sell the two machines I left behind, from which they were able to raise GMD 8,000 (approximately USD 160) for me to get to Agadez, Niger. In Niger, I worked as a tailor in order to take care of my basic needs and raise more money to proceed to Libya. After a month, I made GMD 4,000 (approximately USD 80) and continued my journey. In Libya, I could not work as a tailor; the only thing I could do was work as a laborer. I was sent to prison three times—the first two from checkpoints where I could not pay the money demanded; the third after being caught by the Libyan Coast Guard trying to cross to Italy. My third time in prison was the worst, because we werent given enough food and water and I was physically abused. Luckily, a friend who was working in Libya came to my rescue and paid up to GMD 50,000 (approximately USD 1,000) for my release. After four years of futile attempts to reach Europe, there was no reason for me to continue living in Libya. I could not do anything for myself, nor my family back home. I decided to make my way back to The Gambia by land, and when I reached Agadez, I heard that IOM is assisting people to return home. On 8 October 2018, I finally came back home. With my reintegration assistance, I bought machines and established a tailoring shop in Basse, my hometown. People around the neighbourhood are very supportive. I cant really complain, though I hope to expand my business in the future with more machines and bring young people on board to work for me. If young people are meaningfully engaged, then irregular migration will be a thing of the past."
18	Abdul	Pakistan	Ireland	I	E	far	1167	86251	H	im	male	Abdul was 17 on the rainy night he arrived in Ireland. That night three years ago he spent more than 12 hours alone, waiting for the man who had brought him from Pakistan with promises of a better life in Europe. I spent that whole night wandering around Dublin, he says. I had no idea what to do. I kept walking back to the same place where hed told me to stay. But he never came back. Earlier that day, he had travelled from his home in the city of Peshawar in northwest Pakistan with a contact who had offered to help him seek asylum abroad. They took a bus from the airport in to Dublin city centre where the man bought him some new clothes and handed him money. He told me, Give me your passport, Ill come back in a minute. It was the end of July but it was cold. It rained all night. I can remember the water coming down over OConnell Street. I was very scared. I cried through the night. Eventually, the teenager built up the courage to ask for help. He spoke three languages – Urdu, Pashto and Punjabi – but no English. He could neither read nor write. I kept changing the language, hoping someone could speak one of them. But I was speaking a foreign language, so people just ignored me.
19	Abdul Qadir Babakarkhel	Afghanistan	Afghanistan	I	I	close	508	508	E	hc	male	Born in Afghanistan in 1966, I am the proud father of three children, and have an adorable grandchild. I studied and worked in Afghanistan until 1993 when I had to flee the country because of the war. In search of a safe place for my family and myself, I ended up in the Netherlands, where I had to rebuild my life from scratch at the age of 27. As a married man with two children, having to start all over in a new environment was the biggest challenge of my life. I had lost all my possessions in Afghanistan and didnt speak a word of Dutch. As the famous saying goes, a person without language is half a person. So the first thing I did was to learn Dutch. Besides learning the language, I had to earn a living, so studying and working were the only two things I did for the first two years. I was working and studying 16 hours a day on average. After getting my familys finances under control, I studied IT system management for two years before directing the ICT department of a Dutch company for three years. Between 2003 and 2006 I was mostly in Afghanistan where, among other things, I worked for a short period as an advisor for the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development via IOMs Return of Qualified Afghans programme. I then returned to Europe where in addition to my full-time job, I completed various training courses, including project management and auditing. I went on to hold senior managerial positions at major firms in both the Netherlands and the United Kingdom until 2016 when I decided to take an early retirement. After many years of hard work outside of my country of origin, I decided to return to Afghanistan in September 2018. I did this through the Dutch-funded IOM project Connecting Diaspora for Development. My wish is to contribute to the reconstruction of this beautiful country that I love very much.
20	Abdulkadir	Somalia	Somalia	A	A	close	118	118	E	hc	male	When I grew up in Somalia education was free. Schools were built everywhere and in high school we students helped with the construction of new schools during the weekend. When I started working I was a civil servant at first, but then I was given the opportunity to study at university and become a TV producer. I left the country a few months before the civil war broke out in 1991 because all journalists were targeted. It was very painful to leave my home country, but it was a forced option. I came to Finland in June of 1990. In the winter one of the workers at the reception centre told us we needed to try the sauna, but I told him we have enough heat stored in ourselves for the next thirty years. But I tried at a later time, and I loved it. When I am in Finland I cant live without the sauna. The last seven or eight years I have been mainly in Somalia. I returned to Mogadishu in 2009 and became an MP in the transitional parliament. From June 2011 to November 2012 I was also Minister of Water, Energy, Oil and Minerals. When I returned it was hard to recognize my city. In my memory Mogadishu was clean with nice streets and buildings. When I got back there were no real roads, just bushes and trees, and no buildings, just rubble. It was full of guns, for the slightest thing people were using arms. I found a young generation that had got no education. At the moment I am working for IOMs MIDA FINNSOM-project at the Somali National University in Mogadishu, particularly at the Faculty of Education and Social Science, trying to develop the teaching quality and the capacity building. Now I am making the link, trying to be the bonding bridge between the two educational systems of Finland and Somalia. For the Somali diaspora, and for every diaspora, the goal should be to transfer their experience, knowledge and skills to their home country and share with their fellow people.
21	Abdullah	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	male	My names Abdullah and I come from Aleppo. On the 23rd of September 2015 I left Syria for Turkey. The situation of my family was really bad and it still is, it gets worse by the day. I had to leave Syria because if you are a young man there, everyone wants to recruit you, either Assads army or the Free Syrian Army or even ISIS. I dont want to fight for any of them, theyre all murderers. I hate their system and how the government treats our people, they take advantage of everything. And no one is fighting to free the people, they are just killing them. Im not going to say to you that one side is better than the other, no. All of them are murderers. People are asking why people are fleeing Syria. Its impossible for a human being to live in Syria anymore. You cannot walk in the streets because you will get a bullet in the head, or a bomb will fall on you, or chemical weapons will choke you to death. Theres no water, no electricity, no jobs, no future. Nothing. I was studying at the university but I couldnt complete my studies because of the military services that were chasing me. I had also to work as my father was very sick, he was disabled and I come from a very big family: I have 6 sisters and 3 brothers and all of them have children of their own. So, I decided to leave on my own. I stayed in Turkey for five months and crossed to Greece on the 20th of March 2016, I arrived on the island of Chios and stayed there for five days. Then, I went up north, to the border, where I stayed at the infamous gas station. There, I got to work for medical teams as a translator, first on a voluntary basis and then with a wage. I used to work as a tourist guide when I was 15 back at home, so I speak English with ease and that helped a lot. Back in Syria I was studying economics and finance, Im very much into it but I was also working, for instance as a carpenter.  I left my country with no particular destination in my mind. I just wanted a safe country to live. And Im not going to lie to you, Turkey might be safe but has a lot of political problems and as refugees we have absolutely no rights, so its impossible to settle there. And now Im finally relocating to Spain, I feel really excited, I can hardly wait. I have so many friends there, in Valencia, in Barcelona, in Bilbao, in Madrid and Ive met them all here in Greece. Im going to start a new life, Im going to continue with my studies, doing my own projects, fulfilling my dreams. And I would like to bring my mother along. I dont want to lose her, too, without seeing her again. My father died on the same day I arrived on the island of Chios.
22	Abdullah	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	male	I had the unfortunate luck of being born in Idleb, Syria. Years ago, I never would have said that sentence. I loved living in Syria. But after the fighting started, our lives were ruled by people carrying weapons. Basic rights and necessities, like clean water, were being taken away. People would suddenly disappear or be forced to form a human wall to protect soldiers, forcing civilians to die instead of the soldiers. At one point, most of the city fled to the countryside.  About a month later, the bombing spread to the countryside too, so all the same people returned back to the city.  Bombs were going off everywhere. There was no difference, no safe place, in the city or in the country. One day, all my family was at home. A bomb fell on a neighbors house. Terrified, my father gathered all of us and we hid outside in the field by the trees. Then it happened another day and then another. We used to either hide by the trees or in the basement. We prayed that it would protect us. On April 20, 2015 my mother asked my older brother to go to the market for some bread for breakfast. About five minutes later, two bombs fell on our house. Everything was destroyed. I was in the kitchen when it happened, but when I woke up, I was in the basement. I had no idea how I got there. I tried to move, but it was hard. Everything around me was dark. I felt like I was in a cave with everything wedged in with me. I felt wood and cement around me. I tried pushing it off.  It took me hours to free myself and was finally able to see some light. I climbed towards it over the piles of stone that used to be my house. As I was climbing out, I found my brothers wife covered in blood.  At first, I thought she was dead, but thankfully she was alive. Then I saw my sister stuck among the rubble. I tried pulling her out. I heard my older brothers voice calling for us. I tried to answer him. We are here but no one heard me. The sound of an ambulance drowned out all other noise. I called for my mother and father but still no one responded. No one heard. My older brother survived because he was at the market. He worked with other rescuers to free me, his wife and our sister. I have another brother with a learning disability. Somehow, he managed to escape the house with the help of our neighbors. We were taken to a small village hospital. Thats where I learned my father and mother had died.  They were literally blown to pieces.  The people who helped me were not able to find them in their entirety. We stayed on a farm in Syria as we recovered. We were only four left. We heard that there were doctors in Turkey we could meet so we paid someone to help us cross the border into Turkey. We had to pay them a lot of money – more than most people because of my younger brothers disability. It was a very difficult and dangerous journey. Each of us were only allowed to carry one light bag. It was okay with us as we didnt have much left after our home was destroyed. Ive lived in Turkey for over a year now.  When we first arrived, I wanted to register for school, but so many places required money for fees or transportation. We barely had enough money for food, so there was no way we could pay for school or buses. Then I heard about a community centre that offers Arabic-language education for no charge. I was so excited. Here, at this community centre, I found a sort of home. I found friends who understand what Ive been through. The staff are also so kind to me. The first day when I came back home I felt like I was dreaming.  I had my dream come true to have such a good school. In fact, even in Syria, Ive never had such a good school. I cant forget my past but I do think of the future now. Now, I want to fulfill my mothers dream for me. I want to become a doctor.   Abdullah attends a community centre in Antakya supported by IOM, run by Syria Social Gathering and funded by the European Union. IOMs supported community centre in Antakya offers educational programs, legal assistance, vocational training, social cohesion activities and psycho-social support to over 23,000 Syrians living in Turkeys Hatay province.
23	Abeer	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	female	Its been 7 months since Abeer and her family have relocated to Germany. A few hours before departing for a new beginning, we had a brief chat where she described her journey so far and her prospects about the future. A smart young woman, biology graduate, mother and wife, Abeer had already started working as a translator for Time magazine while living in Greece and searched for ways to continue with her education. It seemed like nothing could get in the way of her search for a better future. Seven months later, Abeer visited the IOM Greece office again, this time not as a beneficiary but as a professional, working with a Time magazine crew. So, Abeer, what happened during these 7 months in Germany? Germany is so different than what we expected. We spent the first six months in an accommodation centre but now we live in a flat, in a village close to Poland. My daughter will go to school at the end of summer and Im really happy about that. My husband, who was diagnosed with a serious heart condition when we were still living in Greece, will finally have his operation in a few days, as soon as I get back to Germany. In the meantime, hes back to school, learning the language. As for me, I got a scholarship for a masters degree from the University of Athens. Its an online course in English about refugee education and Im about to complete it. And, theres Time magazine, I came back to Greece to work with them. They called me and said come to Athens to work with us and as I had already my German passport I agreed gladly. I was expecting that Germany would be perfect, but life can be difficult there, too. Everything is different than in Greece. After spending a year in Greece, it sometimes feels difficult having to adjust to yet another country and reality. At first, I felt really depressed. However, I have made a new start there and no, its not easy. The language is difficult, Ill start classes after I finish with my masters. I hope that this degree will help me find a good job in Germany, the truth is that Id like to start working as soon as possible and learn the language at the same time, I wouldnt like to wait for much longer. I speak English so I think I could start working immediately. The girls at Time magazine encourage me to get to into journalism, they say Id be good at it. When I came back to Greece this time, it smelled a little bit like Syria. Greece is like Syria and people here are like Syrians. Im so happy to be back here, and as I cant go back home. Here, it feels a little bit like home. Abeer is our everything! says Francesca Trianni, a video producer for Time magazine who has been working with Abeer for a year now. We are following Syrian babies and their families for a year as theyre finding their new home in Europe.  We met her when we were working in refugee camps in Thessaloniki and we desperately needed a smart translator who could help us make the story happen, we wouldnt be able to do our job without Abeer helping us to connect with families. She helped us at very tough moments, we filmed women when they were going to labour, we filmed families when they found out about the countries theyd be relocated, very emotional moments. You need incredible people who can help you connect and thats what Abeer has done for us. We didnt hesitate to call her to work with us in Greece even though she had already relocated to Germany, as we needed her. It shows how important it is to have good translators for the work that we do. So, we flew her here for a week to work with us. And I have no doubt she will be able to have a great career in journalism.
24	Abou	Cote d'Ivoire	Niger	A	A	close	2318	568	E	im	male	My name is Abou. I am 33 years old and I am from Côte d'Ivoire. I've been in Niger for nine months. I wanted to reach France. I went to Algeria via Mali. It didn't work out, and I ended up in Niger. Since then, I'm impatient to return to my country and my former activities. I often talk to Seydou (psychologist at the transit centre), and we also do many drawing sessions. We talk about my relatives, the reason why I left, my former life. My old life was quite a mess, and there were too many misunderstandings in my marriage. My wife and I split up after eight years of marriage. There were good intentions, but she did not have feelings for me. She cheated on me. That's one of the reasons why I left. It's actually a mix of many things. There was also a downturn in business, and I lost my job. I decided to do the adventure to get my mind off it and start anew. I reflect on feelings through drawings sometimes, and I use them to express myself. I like drawing a lot. It makes me feel good. At the end of the session, I often say what it means. Last time, for example, I drew a crossed-out heart. It means that there is no feeling. So far, there has been no feeling for anyone else. I'm happy to be going home. I'm going to see my sister. She calls me a lot. I can't wait to return and tell her my story, to have a fresh start for a new life. I would strongly advise all young people my age not to go on an adventure. It's an experience I wanted to try, but what I saw was very serious, people die, they die a lot. Abou is staying in the Aigle transit centre in Niamey. After a long search to find his relatives and continued mental health and psychosocial support, he finally had a breakthrough one day and gave the number of his ex-wife, who helped IOM trace his family. The family reunification and the assistance provided to Abou in the transit centre were made possible with support from the European Union's Emergency Trust Fund for Africa through the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration.
25	Aboubakar	Cameroon	Niger	A	A	close	1502	568	E	im	male	Aboubakar left Cameroon with his young brother and four other male relatives. We wanted to go to Morocco to work there. Then later, we would try to make our way up to Spain. Our goal was Europe. When he left Yaoundé, he only took his backpack with a couple of outfits and two pairs of shoes. Its all gone now. Aboubakar lost all his belongings on a perilous journey trying to reach Morocco. I cannot even remember how I lost my clothes. It was confusing. At some point, I just realized I no longer had my stuff. While trying to reach his final destination, Aboubakar went from one car to another. The migratory route was long and the smugglers were numerous. We got robbed by armed men. They first asked for our IDs, and then they forced us to kneel down and started to hit and kicked us. Aboubakar was left with nothing. The journey cost him what took him years to save. He and his brother never reached Morocco. They gave up in Niger when their other relatives, transported in a different bus, were arrested at a checkpoint at the border with Algeria. He faced death multiple times along the migratory route. I truly regret embarking on this journey. I regret because of what I found on the roads, because I had to sleep in the desert, because I had to walk in the forest. I was aware of the risks but far from understanding them. Now Aboubakar is returning home. I have no choice left. I suffered a lot. I have to return home … and find a way to make ends meet.
26	Abraham	Eritrea	Switzerland	A	E	far	588	86919	H	im	male	"I left my country, Eritrea, by foot for the same reasons as thousands of my compatriots. I did not want to have to take part in the compulsory military service. So I went to Sudan, where I worked as a hairdresser for five years. What Ive been through since the very moment I crossed the Eritrean border is very difficult to tell.  A whole day is not long enough to tell you everything. From Sudan, I tried to reach Libya with many other hopeful people as well. Many died during the journey. I was lucky and made it to the country. Thats when hell started. You cant do anything there; you cant go outside without at least some kind of authorization. I was constantly thinking of my wife, who I left in Sudan, pregnant with our second child. I was lucky enough to reach the Libyan coast, and then to risk my life in the Mediterranean sea. I arrived in Italy and continued to Switzerland. At first, life here was not easy. I was constantly stressed. I had to take care of myself first, and then do my best to bring my wife here. A constant reminder of her throughout my journey was my wedding ring which I hid for safe keeping in my then long hair. But now Im feeling better, despite the tiredness. I believe that things will get brighter one day. Now that I feel better, Im running a lot and I ran the half marathon in Lausanne and in Fribourg. Why do I run that much? To remind myself that Ive done a long journey and yet, Im still alive. In the end, life is only a long journey."
27	Abraham	South Sudan	Kenya	A	A	close	1421	1879	E	im	male	At least I can see windows opening, my eyes are bright again and I am going there to pursue my studies to upgrade my knowledge, and from there a better life. Abraham is a 24-year-old refugee from South Sudan who has been residing in Kenya since 2002. When he was 6 years old, in 1996, he fled from the conflict in South Sudan to Uganda, the neighboring country to the south. Abraham was separated from his parents at the time. His father was away and involved in the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement (SPLM). He fled with his older brother. They walked with other youth who were trying to escape from the insecurity. He recalls the experience very clearly. He states, Though I was young I can still see what was happening - the death, and people being killed, and people having to eat leaves, even me and my brother. It was a struggle. We had to walk long distances. After fleeing from Wao to Rumbek, Abraham arrived in Juba, in present day South Sudan. He then moved across the border into Uganda with his brother with assistance from a convoy. He received support from humanitarian agencies in a refugee camp, where he remained until 2002, when he moved to Kakuma refugee camp in Turkana District of neighboring Kenya. He describes life in Kakuma as difficult, because of many factors, but he was able to receive his education. He was granted refugee status and attended primary school. Later on, around 2007, his older brother decided to return to South Sudan, but Abraham remained in Kenya with no other family members. By then he had been able to get in touch with his parents through a family tracing program using radio, but up until today he has not seen them, and has largely lost touch with them. Abraham then moved to Eldoret, Kenya to attend secondary school. He said one of the challenges was learning Kiswahili, the language in Kenya, but he managed and eventually made high marks and completed his secondary education. Due to his strong performance in school and on examinations, he was awarded a scholarship for university in Canada. He is in the processing of moving to Calgary to attend the University of Calgary on a refugee scholarship. Regarding this opportunity, Abraham says, at least I can see windows opening, my eyes are bright again and I am going there to pursue my studies to upgrade my knowledge, and from there a better life.
28	Abraham	South Sudan	South Sudan	A	A	close	1421	1421	E	hc	male	Born in South Sudan, Abraham lived among war and displacement for most of his life. When fighting intensified in his home town of Bor in 1987, he walked by foot along with thousands of other lost boys to Ethiopia. He lived in Pinyudo, Ethiopia, in a refugee camp until 1991, when fighting broke out in Ethiopia he briefly returned to South Sudan. However, the situation was not safe, and he fled to Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, where he first began school at the age of 12. In 1999, Abraham began the process of resettlement and went to the United States in 2001. When Abraham and several other young men first arrived at the airport in New York City, they were received by IOM and were told to look at a board to find out what state they were going to – Abraham saw a PA next to his name: he was going to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After their flight from New York to Harrisburg landed, Abraham and his friends werent sure if they should get off the airplane because they didnt know what would happen next. After the flight attendants told us that we needed to leave the plane, we were surprised to find that we were greeted by church members and signs with our names for a warm welcome. Him and his friend stayed with a pastor and his wife when they first arrived. The first night, they didnt sleep at all because they didnt know how to turn the lights off in their room – a technology completely new to them. Since he was 19 years old when he arrived in the US, he was too old to attend high school, so Abraham studied and obtained his GED. He went to community college and after two years transferred to Shippensburg University. I nearly gave up the day I began community college because my first assignment was to type a two-page essay. The problem was that I had never used a computer before. Regardless, Abraham quickly learnt how to use a computer and spent hours mastering the skill. After returning to Bor for several months in 2007 to be a mental health trainer, he returned to Pennsylvania and obtained a graduate degree in psychology. I then applied for hundreds of jobs in Africa because I wanted to come back and help my people. I finally landed a job with a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme in Wau, South Sudan. He remains there today and has progressed to be head of his office. Having lived much of his life in war and seeing his country once again plunged into conflict, he still remains hopeful for the future. Looking at South Sudan, it will take a while but I have a strong belief that there will be peace. South Sudan cannot be a good country without all 64 of its tribes – this is who we are.
29	Abubakarr	Sierra Leone	Netherlands	A	E	far	475	53334	H	im	male	I left Sierra Leone at the age of 21, to get away from the war and political instability in my country. When I first got to the Netherlands, a few things that struck me were the tall buildings, the cold weather and the sight of all the white people! But I was immediately impressed by this great nation. During my time here, I feel I have been able to contribute to my community in many ways. First, by emphasising the importance of the businesses migrants have established in the Netherlands, and additional taxes they provide to the state. Secondly, as a consultant on entrepreneurship and diversity, I reconcile public and private interests on a daily basis. I also serve as a key resource person for a number of key Dutch institutions within The Sierra Leone Embassy, businesses and others agencies in Sierra Leone. Finally, I have played a leading role towards to the empowerment and integration of the Sierra Leonean Diasporas in The Netherlands by serving as the president of the Sierra Leone Central Union - a platform for 14 Sierra Leonean organisations based in The Netherlands. It is important for me to do what I can for my country, even though I dont live there currently. I help promote trade and investment between Sierra Leone and The Netherlands. When Im back home in Sierra Leone, I develop and implement educational projects that give young, ambitious people the tools to become the entrepreneurs that the country needs. I also led and lobbied for the inclusion of Sierra Leone in the Connecting Diaspora for Development Programme (CD4D). CD4D is a demand-driven project for addressing capacity-building needs in selected priority institutions in countries of origin. The project enables diaspora professionals to use their expertise, skills and network for the development of their country of origin. For Sierra Leone the focus is on capacity building of institutions in the Health, Education and Agriculture sector. I believe in the power of migrants, especially the youth, and I see the huge untapped talent they have. I will continue to advocate and leverage my experience, expertise and networks to create closer connections and greater prosperity for the target group in the Netherlands. My country is still very important to me, I miss my family and life in the village the most. There is no place like home! We must do all we can to transform our country social and economic potential to benefit all. Still, there were forces beyond my control that required me to leave. To me, home is a place where I feel safe and secure to express my feelings without fear of being captured and tortured.  With a safe and enabling environment, I can develop my talent and potential given to me by God and actively contribute to development of myself and the society. To those who find themselves living away from home, my advice would be to learn the language and culture of the host country. Accept the fact that you are migrants in the country. You must adjust to the host countrys rules, values and inspirations, and do all you can to learn and integrate into the society.
30	Adama	Mali	Algeria	A	A	close	856	3368	E	im	female	One day, Adama, 22, decided to leave his native Mali and embark on a dangerous journey to Italy. His motive for leaving: Though his head was full of hopes and dreams, his pockets were empty,. I left because I wanted to help my mother and my family, he explained. I had to drop out of school very early because my mother could no longer take care of me and my four siblings. I started barbering. But I could not afford to open a barbershop. And I could not just make tea all day at home while waiting for customers. So, I decided to leave. I left in the hope of making money and returning home thereafter. Adama made the big leap. He left Gao, where he worked for a few months before moving north to Algeria. The smugglers take advantage of our illusive hopes. They eat with us, sleep with us, and make beautiful promises only to get our money. I worked for two years in Algeria to pay the crossing, Adama continued, sounding bitter. I wanted to go to Italy, through Libya, at all costs. On our way, the smugglers abandoned us at sea. We were intercepted by the Libyan Coast Guard and sent to detention centres. The living conditions in the prisons were difficult. I saw twelve people die before my eyes. I was released from prison in 2017 with the help of IOM Libya who organized my return home. IOM Mali staff welcomed us at the airport and asked us what job we could do, and they would support us. I chose hairdressing, my job. They offered me a training to improve my hairdressing skills before supporting me in opening a well-equipped shop. Today, I have my barber shop and thank God, things are okay, he concludes. Today, Adamas barber shop, Nosby Barber — or Nosby B, as neighborhood kids call it — has become popular. It is always full of customers. Work at Nosby B starts at 8 AM and ends at midnight. Welcoming as many as 15 customers every day — about one every hour — each day, Adama can save up to CFA 100,000 (150 euros) per month. Its enough to help him support his family, including his mother, and help pay tuition and other school fees of four siblings. Hairdressing is what I know. Today, I have customers and equipment. I want to continue on that path. And if Allah gives me the means to do so, I plan to open several barbershops, says Adama Koné. Make sure you are well-informed about the journey before you leave, because irregular migration leads to absolute desperation, he concludes. Adama has been able to rebuild a new life and reintegrate socially and economically thanks to the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration. Since May 2017, 9,768 returning migrants (as of November 2018) have also begun their reintegration under the project in hopes of starting a new life.
31	Adbalsalam	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	male	I want to eat what I produce from my own labor. I want to help others and not ask for help. I have learned in my life and in my village to do everything by myself. But during the war they stole everything from me. I used to have it all: buildings, money etc. but during the war we lost everything. People were killed next to us, buildings were collapsing. I am sick, but I keep on trying with these crops to produce something and help other people. We prefer to see the green color, I am happy to eat one onion with one piece of bread but form my own crop. I will keep on going, as life goes on and I need to feel that with these fields I do something important. I know that it is difficult but God always helps us and we are fine. We need to live with dignity. We are thankful to IOM because you help us, you help people here at the Thermopiles camp. Thank God, and thank you for everything.
32	Adbulfatha	Ethiopia	United States	A	N	far	840	63123	H	im	male	Almost 12 years later, sitting in my apartment over looking a major highway, all I can really think about is where I would be without that IOM bag. Abdulfatha is referring to the IOM bag that all migrants carry during travel, so they are easily spotted in large and busy airports, and they can be assisted by IOM and its partners. Abdulfatha with his six sisters arrived in the United States from Ethiopia in 2004. They were being reunited with their father, who had been resettled in Minnesota a few years earlier from Kenya. Boarding the plane for the first time, we didn't know where we were going to and did not speak a word of English. Be it not for the white plastic bag with the IOM logo on it, my sisters and I would've been lost. The bag was our passport to America. Even now, Abdulfatha keeps the IOM bag with all the documents that granted him access to the United States. It is at my dads house. He keeps it in a suitcase with all the documents in it. The first few years were really hard. We didnt speak English at all. However, with seven of us learning together, we picked up the language really fast. In about seven months we were able to communicate in English. Besides pursuing his studies as a second year college student, Abdulfatha is also active among his community in Minneapolis. He leads a grassroots organization fighting the expulsion of tenants from public housing in his old neighborhood. The beauty of having been a refugee is that you have firsthand knowledge of not knowing how or where you are going to be sleeping the next day. Thats why I want to be able to help the people that are on the fringe and in risk of being evicted. I am also working to develop pamphlets or booklets in Oromo*, as I have not really seen a lot of literature in Oromo regarding health, financial and digital literacy. I would like to start a nonprofit organization that could fill this gap.   *Oromo is a language spoken by about 30 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Egypt and is considered to be the third largest language in Africa.
33	Afsoon	Iran	Canada	M	N	far	11183	43560	E	im	female	"On a summer afternoon flooded with sunshine when I was four years old, my parents, sister and I walked into the arrivals section of Montreals international airport. To our surprise and delight, a welcoming group of Canadians was waiting for us. That moment of welcome—which remains etched in my parents memories three decades later—symbolized the new life that I would build in Canada after having left my homeland as a child, as a refugee. I have grown up in an adoptive home that I cherish, a country that embraces unity in diversity. It was easy to see the value of diversity, because by my fifth birthday, I had been immersed in four cultures—Persian, Pakistani, Acadian and English Canadian—each with their own rich languages and histories. And in each of those places I had encountered people with courageous hearts and open minds. Contrasted with the events that led to my familys escape from Iran, it was not difficult to internalize even as a young child that justice and equality are not merely lofty goals, but rather practical imperatives whose presence or absence have incalculable consequences in peoples lives. The 1979 Iranian Revolution and its aftermath forced my family to flee our home; as members of the Bahai Faith, we were summarily persecuted. My parents lost their jobs, my father as an engineer and my mother as a teacher. Far worse than that was facing the constant and arbitrary risk of peril. After a series of events, including the abduction, torture, and execution of my uncle, my parents made the excruciating decision to flee. We undertook the perilous journey to Pakistan. For two days in the summertime desert, we walked with no food, drinking water from dirty pools in the desert. We literally ran across the border, narrowly avoiding an army patrol tank that would have fired upon sight. We arrived in Pakistan half-alive, but free. Nearly a year later, with the help of the UNHCR and the Canadian government, we boarded a plane destined for Montreal. In Canada, I learned that one special night of the year, I could dress up as a bumble bee, visit my neighbours, and receive more treats than I thought existed. And that even if it was my first ever visit to church, Santa Claus knew that I was there and had been a good girl, and so offered me a gift alongside all the other children. These sweet childhood memories, alongside painful ones, taught me an important lesson: to grow flourishing plants, the farmer first has to tear up the soil. To transform glass into art, the blower must first plunge the raw material into fire. The fact that my family and I became refugees as a result of events out of our control, and that we faced and overcame circumstances of extreme hardship and uncertainty—this is not something I lament, it is something I value. It is what motivated me to pursue studies in law, and become a refugee and immigration lawyer. And it is what impels me to tell my story through the art of storytelling. These days, when someone asks me where I am from, I hearken to the words of Pico Ayer and say that I belong to the ever-growing group of people who get to choose the answer to that question. Sometimes it is the land of my birth, a place from which I remain in exile and for which I carry a strange nostalgia. Sometimes it is Toronto, the most multicultural city in the world, where I grew up. But most often, it is a place inside me: an intangible yet steady place from which I can connect with every other human being. Because we are all human before we are anything else."
34	Agathe	France	Switzerland	E	E	close	38959	86919	E	im	female	"I am currently a student at the Graduate Institute in Geneva, Switzerland where I moved from France. Migration means a person's movement from one country to another. It does not only imply work, but also student mobility and more. Sometimes, this move can represent a shock to the system, especially when a person feels unable to do one of the most important things — communicate. I try to support migrants by teaching them French within our French courses at the Graduate Institute. Besides the French classes, I also try to give them moral support by listening to their story and letting them know that not only me, but all my volunteers professor can help them with anything. Through this work, I have made a few general observations about people who move to a new country, in this case Switzerland. I really found that people were afraid to talk to me about their stories or worries. It is normal that it would take time for people to open up to me, so it is necessary for me to be patient and wait until they are ready talk about how they feel. But I think it is important that when new people arrive, they open their heart and feel welcome by the locals Integration means getting over the idea that a migrant will stay a migrant, and this is a two-way street both the new arrivals and the locals need to travel. We need to take away that idea that a migrant/refugee will always stay the same; people change and adapt, and it is necessary to take away stigma and keep being open minded."
35	Agustin	México	Estonia	L	E	far	8326	23106	E	im	male	In 2012, my friend and I travelled to the Baltics where we visited the capitals of each country. That is when I first visited Estonia. After my travel, I went back to my daily life and kept thinking about Tallinn. I really liked this city. It was a cosy, laidback, clean, safe and affordable city. At the time, I had already worked in three main technological hubs in the United States. I began reading about Estonia. I found out the country has a very strong culture of entrepreneurship and start-ups so I chose to come here for my graduate studies. When I came to Estonia I realised people were efficient here, they get things done. They are demanding and have high expectations but people know what theyre doing. The topic of migration seems to cause a lot of unease here. Im concerned about the anti-migrant rhetoric as some issues have escaped from rhetoric to verbal and physical aggression. I think this is a problem that needs to be addressed and kept in check. Unfortunately, people here care too much about their reputation and things are discussed only when something really bad happens. We shouldnt consider talking about intolerance and xenophobia as a taboo. Since, I am an activist and volunteer in an organisation for international students, I have started to collect data on the kind of intolerance incidents international students have witnessed and been victims of. I hope to use it in some way. I think xenophobia is programmed in peoples minds, but it needs to be kept in check. Integration surely will take many years and effort must be done on different fronts. I have been here for four years and I enjoy what I do here. You never know what life brings, but at least now I see myself in Estonia, improving my language skills, starting a start-up, continuing my involvement with non-profits and advocating for tolerance.
36	Agyei	Ghana	Ghana	A	A	close	2206	2206	E	hc	male	I was working as an electrician in my country, Ghana, but could not afford to own my own business, as I had always dreamed of. I decided to go to Libya in 2010, traveling through Togo and Niger. We spent 11 days travelling through the desert with very little food and water. I would pour some petrol in the water to keep myself from drinking it all at one go. We encountered armed robbers along the way who would make you strip to make sure you had given them all your money. To hide my money, I had to insert it into my anus. This is what we called the West African bank. It was the only option we were left with. But at the same time, if the robbers didnt get any money from you, they could kill you so we always had some little money to give to them. Along the route we saw human remains – people who were either too weak or sick or abandoned by their smuggler, just left there, without a proper burial. Once in Libya, I worked in the construction field as a mason. I immediately began to see improvements in my life. I was able to send money to my family. Overall, I was living a more comfortable life. But because of the situation in Libya, it was unsafe and I had no choice but to return to Ghana after nine months. If it werent for the Arab Spring happening in the region back then, I would have stayed. Today, I own a phone credit store. I am providing all I can to my family including my three brothers and sister. I am saving money to open up the electrical shop that I once dreamed of having. Im hopeful about the future. The one thing Ive learned through all of this is that - money is important but life is precious.
37	Ahmad	Kuwait	Bulgaria	M	E	far	24809	10058	E	im	male	"I was born in Kuwait, but Im originally from Palestine; I came to Bulgaria in 1992 when I was five years old. It is hard for me to point out something specific that I miss about Palestine, since I have been here for most of my life. I am a full Bulgarian by now. I hadnt been back to Palestine for such a long time; I went back for the first time in November last year. That was the first time I got to see what is happening in the region. There are two questions I am never fully able to answer: what is your name and where are you from. The answer to the first one does not sound at all like it should in Bulgarian. It has nothing in common with my original name. Because of this, to make it a little easier, my friends thought of a nickname for me eight years ago, Habibi ('my love' in Arabic), and they still use it. The second question is hard to answer because my parents were born in Palestine, but I was born in Kuwait and have lived in Bulgaria my whole life. What I enjoy the most in Bulgaria is nature and my friends. I like to travel and walk a lot, mainly in the mountains. I can combine both in my job as an architect. I get to travel around Europe for conferences and other gatherings. My favorite Bulgarian food is tripe soup; we are the only ones, besides Bulgarians, that can make and eat that. There is a Palestinian community in Bulgaria and we meet up from time to time. I have some friends among this group and we keep in contact, but most of them went back to Palestine. My mom is a teacher at a Palestinian school here. My dad is also a teacher, in physics, but he moved to Qatar to work for a few years. I also speak Arabic; I graduated from an Arabic language school in Bulgaria."
38	Ahmad	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	male	I was studying Dentistry at Damascus University and working in a private lab after my lectures. As I had this job, I completed my degree within two years. But unfortunately, war changed everything. I was regularly taking part in demonstrations and I was part of the university hip-hop band. We were trying to express our frustration with the situation through music. Very soon the regime caught on with our activities and soldiers started to make our lives harder. I knew that I would end up in jail at some point and that is not really what I wanted in life. I wanted to work, have a successful career, and be an active member of society. Thats all. I escaped to Egypt and started working in Cairo two days after I arrived. After a year, my work permit was not extended and I left to Turkey. It took me 15 days in Istanbul to find a job because I didnt speak the language. In Turkey there was a growing sentiment against Syrians coming to the country so after 8 months there, the landlord refused to renew our contract because we were young Syrian men. We searched and searched a flat in Istanbul and couldnt find any. I took this as a sign to move forward. I decided to seek asylum in Europe, not to receive help but to be able to work. My brother and I arrived in Germany on Christmas Day 2014. A volunteer at the refugee center explained to me how to look for jobs and she put me in touch with the boss of a dental lab in Berlin. In August I went for a skills assessment at the lab and was told that they really needed somebody like me. One month ago I finally got my residence permit and I was hired in the lab! Im an orthodontist. I dont have direct contact with clients and with my colleagues I mostly communicate in the little German I learned on Youtube tutorials and thanks to volunteers classes. My colleagues are so nice to me and happy to have a Syrian person working with them. Now, I want to learn the language. This is the switch between being a refugee and somebody who has a normal life here. You will be a refugee as long as you dont understand people around you. In the moment you speak German, people will stop judging you by the cover. You will have a chance to tell who you are. Im doing everything as fast as possible because I have a dream - I want to open my own lab at the age of 30. I want to give jobs to other people and contribute to society.
39	Ahmad	Syrian Arab Republic	México	M	L	far	890	8326	H	im	male	"My name is Ahmad, I am 23 years old. I was born in the city of Aleppo, Syria. I graduated from the University of Aleppo in Telecommunications from the Faculty of Electronics and Electrical Engineering in 2016. I worked in a small organization in Aleppo that provided people with food and clothing. Before graduating, I was a teacher and also an intern in a telecommunication company, Syrialtel. In the first events of the war in Aleppo in 2012, I left to Al-Bab, a city outside Aleppo where my grandparents lived. After a couple of months, I went back to Aleppo because I wanted to finish my studies, as in 2012 I was in my first year of College. I graduated four years later and had to decide whether to go or stay and wait for an unwanted destiny since I didn't have a job and I wanted to continue my studies. I decided to leave Syria - it was necessary due to the war. I am very happy because I am part of the Habesha project*; this change is like a miracle after very difficult years in Syria. To be honest, I didn't know anything about Mexico, but once the Habesha project helped me, I started researching a little of Mexican history, culture, ecosystems and food. When I arrived at the airport in Mexico, I saw many very friendly and amazing people. The language is a little complicated since I had never had to use the Spanish in my life, but I am taking a Spanish course at the UVM College as a part of the Habesha projects partnerships. I'll get a good level to study a masters degree. Finally, I want to thank the Habesha project for giving me the opportunity to finish my studies in such a beautiful country as Mexico and for making it possible for me to learn the language and to live just like any other citizen. * The Habesha Project is a neutral, not-for-profit, non-political, and non-faith based international Mexican and Costa Rican-led humanitarian initiative aimed at making it possible for Syrian students who have fled the conflict to travel to Mexico to pursue higher education.

40	Ahmad	Syrian Arab Republic	United Kingdom	M	E	far	890	40718	H	im	male	Football has always been a big part of my life – growing up in Syria, as a refugee in the region and now in the UK. To me, it doesnt matter where you are from. As long as there's a love of football, we'll always have something to talk about.   As a kid in Aleppo, I used to play football in the small park by my house with my neighbourhood friends. Back then, our pitch was nothing like the ones I saw on TV, but that made no difference to us. It was all about the game itself. I dreamed of being one of the players of Etihad (one of the most famous football clubs in Syria). When I wasnt playing football, my friends and I would watch the game on TV at a cafe. It was great to meet, cheer and catch up with people. It didnt matter so much which league was playing, as long as it was football.   I remember the last time I watched a World Cup in my own country. It was the 2010 tournament in South Africa. Everyone in my town (Aleppo) gathered in local cafes to watch, cheer and trade banter for rival teams. I supported Argentina that World Cup – we didnt win, but it was still special to watch.   In December of that same year, the Arab Spring started in Tunisia and it arrived in Syria in early 2011. From that time on, my life and the lives of millions of fellow Syrians changed forever.   The sheer level of violence and the disruption to everyday life left little room for football. It was a violent and brutal time, but not all the news was negative. I remember hearing about a time during a truce in Aleppo when individuals from the fighting sides managed to organise a football match. Just 15 kilometres from my house, the front-line that used to divide them turned into a neutral space where both sides put down their guns to play football. Although the truce was short-lived, the symbolism of that match was important to us in Aleppo - maybe there could be an end to the war.   In 2013, I fled to the Kurdish region of Iraq. Inside the refugee camp, football was a great activity for teenagers and young people with little or nothing to do. Camp organisers would arrange matches against other refugee camps or we would play with the local community. Thats how I got to know my Iraqi hosts and I could slowly see them overcome their preconceived notions of refugees. Even in Iraq, there were myths to disprove.   In 2015, I arrived in the UK as an asylum-seeker and was placed in Middlesbrough in northeast England. Trying to adapt to a new country is not easy or straightforward, especially for us those of us who were forced to flee our homes with no option to go back. We were separated from our families and our friends who had always been there to support us. Now, I was all alone in a country I'd never even seen before.   Although I was so happy to be in England and to feel safe, adapting to life here was complicated. Yes, I could speak the language and master basic tasks like shopping and taking public transportation, but there was a social and cultural element missing. I didnt know anyone and I didnt have a routine to ground myself.  It was isolating.   It took a few months to figure out where to meet people. The Middlesbrough Football Club supported a group organising football matches for asylum-seekers, refugees and community members. I immediately joined the team and learned so much from the other refugees and the British players. It wasnt only about football, but it was social too. This was my opportunity to not only share the pitch, but also to share food, culture, hopes and aspirations.

I returned to Chad following the armed conflict in 2014 and am currently living in the Kobiteye site for returnees where I am the current Vice President. When we left CAR, my family and I left with my Toyota brand van and it is thanks to this means of transportation that we have been able to take care of ourselves for years . Once we arrived in Chad, we started with transporting people from Goré to Yamodo, Beboungai, and Moundou. With this truck, I support my family of 9 children and can contribute in one way or another by giving access to the sites of returnees, villages, and surrounding cities.
42	Ahmed	Egypt	Italy	A	E	far	3609	31238	H	im	male	"I moved to Italy for love. I met an Italian girl in Egypt, we fell in love and I decided to move to Sicily to be with her. We got married and now we have three children. Adapting to my new host country was tough at the start, I have always been used to working but, for the first year I was living in Italy, I could not find anything. When I found a job as an interpreter, everything changed for the better. Little by little, I started to feel more integrated. I went back to studying and obtained my diploma that I already completed in Egypt, since my certification was not recognized in Italy. In other words, I graduated twice; it was a bit of a sacrifice but I am proud of it. In 2007, I started working as a cultural mediator for the International Organization for Migration, right at the landing points in Southern Italy, especially in Lampedusa. My job is very important for me; it is very rewarding. I am the benchmark for migrant men, women and children who arrive completely disoriented, after risking their lives at sea and in the desert, or who went through unspeakable violence throughout their journeys.  For them, finding someone who speaks their language and who is there listening to their stories, is a big psychological support. Some of them even think, with admiration, that I arrived by sea, too. It struck me to realize what a relief it is for migrants to meet another foreigner; it gives them hope that one day they will integrate here too. Being a migrant is not always easy, although I have rarely experienced episodes of prejudice. I remember that one time, I went to a migrant reception center for work but the guards would not let me out because they thought I had just landed too. They did not believe I was the mediator. I was held there for an hour before they let me out. It was awkward but, in the end, also funny. Luckily, that never happened again. I have to admit that if I think about home, I think of Italy. My sons, who have never left the country, also feel partly Egyptian. They often tell me they want to visit Egypt and discover their origins: I am happy they feel this way, we will go there soon. However, the sense of attachment for my country of origin waned with time. The motherland I chose is Italy, Sicily in particular. Whenever my sons watch the news and they see footage of landing points, they call me to know if I am there too. They are proud of me, because they know their dad is helping other people in need. They talk about it at school too! Being a cultural mediator, on the one hand, allows me to help migrants, and on the other, makes my children proud. And it motivates me to do a good job."
43	Ahmed	Finland	Somalia	E	A	far	48685	118	L	im	male	Ahmed is a Somali medical nurse from Finland working in Somaliland. Part of the diaspora, he feels his hometown is just as much in Finland as it is in Somalia as he grew and did his studies in Helsinki. Originally planning to be a civil engineer, his career path took a different turn when he decided that he wanted to be able to directly help people. In a way, it felt like I had a calling to be a nurse, I really couldnt describe it any other way he explains. The transition was not easy but he was more than glad once he started working as a nurse. An interesting thing to adapt to was overcoming the notions that some may hold regarding male nurses working in a female dominated industry. Luckily, my family has always been supportive and in the eyes of the people in need here, I am just as good as any doctor to them As the days go on with no substantial rainfall, Ahmed has a very different worry in mind You want to know what the worst thing is? It is not just the fact that it is not raining but the fact that when it does eventually rain, all of that rainwater is just going to run across the land picking up disease from all of the dead animals and then feed into their water supplies. That is when more diseases will come.   Through a special project support by IOM, Ahmed has been able to work in remote village providing medical help to those affected by the drought. In the case of Bali Hiile where he is visiting, the nearest doctor is over 50km away.
44	Ahmed	Iraq	Greece	M	E	far	4146	18117	E	im	male	I am from Iraq and I came to Greece seven months ago and here I am now on my way back to Baghdad. I am a professional hairdresser and I left my home country, seeking a better life in Europe for me and my wife. And although she made it to Germany, I got stranded in Greece. At first, I worked as a hairdresser but as time progressed, I found myself with limited options and opportunities. That is why I started looking for a way to go back to Iraq. That was the moment when I found out about the Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration Programme, materialized by IOM Greece, through fellow migrants and I quickly decided it was the right way to go. I want to go back and see my parents who are in Bagdad. Also, I will bring my wife back from Germany, although she was granted a German passport. I am very happy, because I was informed that I am eligible for a reintegration programme which will give me the opportunity to have further aid and support when I get back home. Finally, I will have my own hair salon! Together with my wife, we will start again our lives in Iraq and later on we will have a family – we are still young. I wish I will be able to visit Greece again, as everyone was really kind to me. Only that next time, I will be coming as a tourist!

My daughter is 11 years old and my son is 6. We left our home country due to a serious family issue. We began our journey from Erbil, Iraq. Turkey was our first stop, then the Greek island of Samos and finally Athens, where we stayed in an open accommodation center run by NGO Praksis for almost a year. Leaving your home country is never easy, especially when you have a good job and a decent income. I was running a butcher shop, selling chicken for more than 24 years. Here in Greece, is very difficult to find a good job. Furthermore I want my children to go to school. While we were staying in Athens, some family members from Erbil informed us that our family problem was solved. Allow me not to say more, since it is very personal. These was actually good news for me and my children. We started thinking about returning home, so I called IOM to find out more details about voluntary returns. All IOM staff was really helpful and we booked an appointment very quickly. Since I have an experience as a butcher, we discussed the possibility of getting a reintegration package, which will allow me to operate again my small business. IOM counsellor was positive and now not only I am ready to return to my home country but I can also start working again. My children are also very happy since they are looking forward going back to school.
46	Ahmed	Iraq	United States	M	N	far	4146	63123	H	im	male	May 19, 2008 was the start of a new chapter in the United States for Ahmed and his family. Ahmed, his younger sister and parents were resettled in Sioux Falls, South Dakota after fleeing the war in Iraq. It took us four planes to get here! We went from Damascus to Budapest, Budapest to New York and then New York to Chicago and finally to South Dakota, recalls Ahmed. Ahmed and his family first found refuge in Syria in 2006, On July 26th, 2006, our house was bombed. About a couple weeks later, my dad said we were getting out of there. During those couple of weeks, we moved around and that was the beginning of several relocations over the course of six years. I never thought of the distance of those relocations, I always thought that we were going to a place nearby. Ahmed was just 7 years old when he experienced displacement for the first time and didnt always understand the significance of it. It was exciting for me because I got to see a place Ive never seen before. So whenever we would stop somewhere to get food or to rest I would always be really excited because I love travelling in any form. I remember thats when my love for travelling started. Last year, Ahmed became a United States citizen and found himself questioning his identity. . For the past few months, I have been trying to really identify. We have a debate at school and I am trying to write my speech about identity crisis. Ive realized time and time again that you must take the positive between the two identities and try to put them together to create something that is truly unique and that works for you. I realized that I can really embrace the duality of my experiences. Ahmed shares his experiences and journey from Iraq to Syria to the United States in his recently finished memoir. The book was first to write a testament of the struggles that my family and I have overcome. I wanted to write so I would never forget where I came from, what I witnessed and what I hope to achieve. But I think the biggest thing I want to accomplish with my book is to change that narrative that I have faced ever since I came to America: that Middle Easterners, whether they are refugees or migrants, are terrorists. I think there is no better time than now to get my story out there and put a face to the word Muslim. Much of what is happening now in the media is that people are being dehumanized. I hope individuals who read my story will realize that here is a kid who was a refugee and heres what he did with his experiences.

I then relocated to Jordan where I stayed for another four years to learn Arabic while I worked for a local paper. One time I went back to Senegal for holidays, I met my wife and she got pregnant. We have three kids together. I havent met the youngest yet. She got pregnant a couple of years ago when I last saw her. In 2007, a friend suggested I go with him to Libya because he knew about some work opportunities. I rapidly felt integrated since I knew the language and understood their culture. I started teaching private classes and always got along well with my students. Back then it was different - they valued education, there were banks and people got paid. It was hard for me to see my students in such frightening situations: 12-year-olds driving their mothers to the market, accompanying them gun in hand. They go to the fields to train how to shoot. I can only pray for their future. After ten years in Libya, I can say I have seen both sides of the coin. I have met men of their word, but also men ready to kill me at every step. I rapidly found this out after my first time in prison back in 2013. I had met a young pharmacist that I quite liked. Her brother despised me so together with his friends he almost beat me to death. Then they put me in prison. They used to torture me every day, asking me to confess our relationship. I used to scream and scream, but nobody heard me. I never called my family to ask for money – never. After starving me for five days, they eventually set me free. Nevertheless, I ended up in prison three more times. I have lived in the Arab world since 1994 and I realized they are people just like any other people, with strengths and weaknesses. When they notice something works – good or bad – they stick to it. God created us all to live together in peace, but they are still trying to survive a war and this is what they know best. When I was finally coming back to Niger, I spent 15 days stranded in the desert. I saw more than 800 graves during that time. When I arrived at the transit centre, I saw children recreating these gravesites with stones. I couldnt even find it sad anymore – it was something beyond that. After what I experienced in Libya, I think there is a little bit of me that died. When we are young, we have all of our lives ahead of us. The youth shouldnt be thinking 'its either Europe or nothing'. Education is the most important thing. There are other ways to make it in life that dont involve crossing a desert.
48	Ahmed	Somalia	Finland	A	E	far	118	48685	H	im	male	I came to Finland as a refugee at the end of 1990, I was 20 years old. I started studying nursing and worked for a long time as a nurse at the dialysis unit at the Helsinki University Hospital, eventually I became the unit's head nurse. At the same time I studied at Tampere University for a Masters degree in Health Sciences. In 2006 I started as a teacher at a vocational college. In 2006 me and a group of other Somali diaspora health professionals approached the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland to see if we could use our experience in aid of Somalia. IOM, the UN Migration Agency, joined in on the pilot project and in 2008 the first professionals were sent to Somaliland and Puntland through the MIDA FINNSOM Health project. The project is still ongoing and has had very good results. I am now working on establishing the second dialysis unit in Somaliland, in Boroma General Hospital. The first has been in function since April 2012 in Hargeisa Group Hospital. It would actually not be there without me. In 2011 I discovered two unused dialysis machines that had been donated to the Hargeisa Group Hospital four years earlier, but no-one knew how to operate them. Many people were dying at moment because there were no dialysis units in Somaliland, nor in the whole of Somalia for that sake. Those with money travelled abroad, but the costs were very high. I trained the nurses and doctors to use the equipment and we were able to get more machines through donations. Now we can treat 20 patients in two shifts every day in Hargeisa. When I first went back to Somaliland I was surprised at the culture shock I experienced. I thought that since I was born and raised there, I would still feel at home there. But I never realized how much Finnish culture had influenced me, especially when it comes to working life. In Somaliland people dont come on time to their appointments, neither the staff nor the patients, which makes it hard to run a dialysis unit. Promises are not always kept either, so nowadays I watch the maintenance staff like a hawk until the promised repairs are done. Still it feels more meaningful to work there. Of course there are people in Finland who are very ill and need care, but I know that in Finland someone else will take my place and do the work. In Somaliland and Somalia they need me more.
49	Ahmed	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	male	I left Syria when I was still in high school. I havent been able to complete my studies yet, but I want to. Im really interested in IT and computer engineering. Im from a village around the city of Idlib. Its mainly agricultural, tourists didnt go there much. We lived a calm life, but we had everything we needed. Everything was so simple. I used to play football with my friends, always thinking of my favorite teams, Barcelona and Manchester United! It never crossed my mind to move before the war. I had a happy life in Idlib. Everything is gone now. There wasnt even a choice of living there anymore, and there was also no chance of building a life in Lebanon. There are eight people in my family and we are all moving to Canada, but my case came up first so I am going alone. I know that Canada respects human rights and cares about people. Thats why they are running this program, and I hope they continue it. My biggest hope now is that I can go back to school. Arabs have a lot of potential, but no opportunities to develop their skills and capabilities in their home countries. I hope to have that chance in Canada.
50	Ahmed	Syrian Arab Republic	Jordan	M	M	close	890	4283	E	im	male	My name is Ahmed. In 2012, I was forced to leave my home in Syria and I now live here at the Zaatari refugee camp with my wife Eehasan, my son Ziad and my daughter Zeina. We had a happy life in Syria – Eehasan worked as a supply teacher, Zeina was doing well at school, Ziad was in the local football team. Business was going well for me – I owned a furniture showroom in town. It didnt start as a war. I am not involved in politics but we knew of demonstrations in other areas of the country. Then gradually things started to turn. Each day Ziad would return home from school with awful stories of things that had happened to his friends on the way home, so we had to stop him from going to school. One night 4,000 people were killed in our town of Homs. I started to receive threats and warnings, so I closed up the shop, took my family and left. When I returned to check the situation two weeks later, soldiers had taken over my shop and our house had been burnt out. I thank God that we got out in time but the feeling I get when I think about my business and home all gone is indescribable. All the stock, all the money I had – gone. I cant think about it, I just have to look forward. When we first arrived here, life was very difficult. Zeina became very sick. We had gone from living a normal life to living in a tent in the desert. The dust and the conditions made her physically ill but she was also in shock – she would have frequent panic attacks and stopped eating. We thought she would die. My own deteriorating health and the worry gave me a heart attack. It was a very difficult time for us. After a while, instead of focusing on all the things we found difficult, we started to look on the bright side. We learned to cope. WFP provided us with hot meals each day which helped so much – it was just one less thing to have to think about. We wanted to start living again, so I managed to get a full-time job with one of the agencies here, and my wife has started working in the schools as a teacher. I tell my daughter that her weapon is her study. Zeina is smart and she works hard at school. That must be her focus now. Her dream is to become a paediatrician. She always wanted to help people but now, after everything that has happened to us, her dream has only become stronger and we are so proud of her. The WFP school meals are such a help – they encourage many of the children to go to school. We dont have any money to give Zeina for food but we know she will be fed there and we know many parents here that feel the same way. When we arrived at Zaatari, there was one school – now we have 13 schools! I know Eehasan feels so proud that she was able to help WFP promote school meals and education here in the camp. As for us, we feel like life is getting better and WFP has helped with that. We use our WFP e-card to buy whatever we want from the store. We now cook the meals we like and buy whatever ingredients we need. When we enter the supermarket now, it is with dignity. When we arrived here, we tried to forget what we had seen and move on. Thank God that we arrived here alive and that we are together. All I really want is peace in Syria and for us to be able to go home. However, most of all I just want my children to have a happy future.
51	Ahmed	Syrian Arab Republic	Luxembourg	M	E	far	890	117182	H	im	male	Ahmed from Syria has been living in Luxembourg with his family. Their apartment – the second one, after spending a short period of time in a reception centre – is located at the beautiful, leafy suburb of Beaufort. On the 15th of November 2015, Ahmeds family was among the first group of beneficiaries that left Greece for Luxembourg, under the European Union's relocation programme implemented by the IOM. From Athens, the family of five flew to Brussels and a bus took them to Luxembourg. They were accompanied by IOMs staff and since that day, they never lost touch. After all, its easy for Ahmed to communicate in Greek: he had spent many years in Greece working for a small garment factory, then, he went back to Syria, before the war broke. The next time he set foot in Greece, it was to save his family from that war. His son, Mohamed, was born in Greece. Ahmed is fluent in Greek and he loves popular Greek music. A year after their arrival in Luxembourg, IOMs staff met again with Ahmed, his wife Amina and their three children. They are very satisfied with their life in Luxembourg, in particular with the health care and education system. At the familys arrival, all three of the children enrolled in school and they already speak Luxembourgish, French and German. As for the parents, fthey are taking French classes in order to be able to work as soon as possible. They are all very happy and now, they can also apply for Aminas mother to be relocated from Syria to Luxembourg. The door of the familys welcoming home is always open for IOM Greece staff. Ahmed wants to keep on practicing Greek and visit as soon as he gets the opportunity.
52	Ahmed	Syrian Arab Republic	Syrian Arab Republic	M	M	close	890	890	E	hc	male	Ahmed is one of the drivers tasked with the dangerous mission of transporting humanitarian supplies into Syria. Despite being one of the younger drivers he has the scars to show for his work as he rolls up his sleeves to show the shrapnel wounds he received from bombs dropped from warplanes while on the road. Living in northern Aleppo he regularly makes the route between borders to transport the goods to neighbourhoods in need. When asked why he took up the dangerous job he smiles and replies theres no other work available for me anyways and the threat of being bombed is always there for me whether I am on the road or at home.
53	Ahmed	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	male	A 14-year-old boy sat roasting small pieces of skewered meat over a flame with his left hand, his missing right hand conspicuous despite his attempts to tuck it away. A member of the so-called Islamic State sawed his hand off a few months ago, along with his left foot. A cloth bandage covered the stump of his arm, while the bare end of his severed lower limb jutted out. With his uncles help, Ahmed – not his real name – hopped to a plastic stool that one of the children moved towards him. They told me that if I had been 15 or 16 I would have been killed, Ahmed said, implying he had been relatively fortunate compared to those older than him. Visibly shaking at times, defiant at others, he spoke to Refugees Deeply about the events that led to his punishment. Ahmed claimed some of his relatives had been involved in the uprising against the Syrian regime from the beginning and had later also fought against ISIS. When ISIS took over the area in eastern Syria in summer 2014, he continued living with his grandmother but had failed to ask for forgiveness from ISIS, he said, noting that this was a requirement for all those whose family members had opposed the extremist group. He had also resisted attending mandatory Sharia law courses. Schools in the area stopped running four years ago due to government bombing, he said. I started working as a mechanics assistant from age 10. (.) Soon afterward, family members managed to take him across the border to Turkey..
54	Ahmed	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	male	"Ahmed is one of the many refugees receiving psychosocial care at the Syrian Social Gathering (SSG) centre near Hatay, Turkey. A former engineering student in Homs, Ahmed was arrested by authorities back in 2012 during a peaceful protest. Following his arrest he was detained in prison for seven months. There, he was repeatedly tortured including electrocution which resulted in long term brain damage. Eventually, Ahmed was released from prison and shortly after he and his wife fled from Homs to Turkey. Shortly after arriving in Hatay, he faced the same challenge that several other refugees faced - finding stable employment. After months of looking for work but to no avail and running low on resources, Ahmed was faced with the tough decision of returning to Syria. It was on this perilous journey back that he ran into further misfortune as he ended up being captured several times by several different warring groups within Syria. He was regularly beaten and questioned on his alleged affiliations with other opposing groups. He was eventually tried by one of the armed groups that captured him, falsely accusing him of connections with other rival armed groups. When I was held by them, they would toy with me, telling me how they would cut off my head, he explains. Luckily he was eventually freed when family members provided witness testimony of his innocence. Now finally in Turkey, he has a more jaded view of the ongoing conflict in his country. After being held by nearly all of the main armed groups in the war I see that there are no clear good sides. They all have dirty hands and I have no intention to ever come back to that place again. I just want to move on with my life here in Turkey. At the SSG, he receives regular psychosocial care from his case worker. He is great to me; he has been helping me with my concentration which Ive been struggling with since being tortured. This is also helping me get out of my depression. Hes really changed my life and given me the self-confidence I need to rebuild my life again. As he continues to receive regular care from his social worker, he now looks forward to completing his engineering degree in Turkey, enrolling his two daughters into the education program at SSG and carrying on with his life with his family."
55	Ahmed	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	male	"Born with a physical disability in his left leg, Ahmed grew up in Aleppo where he worked with other handicapped people through education, advocacy and case work. There were a lot of people who really did not understand what it meant to be handicapped. I remember working with a man who did not see daylight for years because his family was ashamed of his disability. People who are disabled should not looked down upon. Quite the opposite really, you should encourage them to be successful in life despite of their condition. Ahmeds condition worsened three years ago when a mortar landed near him when he was on the street with his newly wed wife at the time. The shrapnel from the mortar injured his good leg and he developed gonarthrosis (osteoarthritis of the knee). Following the incident Ahmed decided that it was time he and his family fled to Turkey. Shortly after arriving in Salinufra, Ahmed struggled to find a job but his condition left him virtually immobile making employment nearly impossible. After sometime he did manage to find a job but struggled to maintain it due to his disability which resulted in him suffering from depression for a year. It was so bad, I couldnt walk at all. I felt completely useless to myself and my family. Eventually his case was referred to IOM who conducted an assessment on his condition and gave him a walking device for his injured leg that has enabled him to walk again. It was absolutely incredible; this device really gave me power again. I now have the confidence I need to get through the day. Excited, Ahmed found a renewed hope in his life and managed find a job with the International Mercy Crops. Its a small start but things can only get better from here. You cannot imagine the joy I get from being able to provide for my family and still be able to buy some sweets on my way home for my little girl, he beams."
56	Ahmed	Syrian Arab Republic	United States	M	N	far	890	63123	H	im	male	We never imagined we would have to move one day. However, we need to find a new home. We have become victims of sectarianism and religious intolerance. We love Syria so much that we refused to take sides. We refused to see it fall victim to its hatred, intolerance and political dispute. Now, home is where the person grows and lives.  Ahmed* lived in Damascus his entire life until violence erupted in 2011. Married and responsible for a wife and three lovely daughters, he felt compelled to run for his and his familys lives. After their house was demolished in 2013, Ahmed decided to move to Egypt. Through his friends in Egypt, Ahmed found a job in one of Egypts Delta cities. After crossing into Lebanon, Ahmed and his family then flew to Egypt. Initially after moving to Egypt, Ahmed planned to settle until the situation in Syria got better and they were able to move back. As the intensity of the violence heightened in Syria and the economic situation in Egypt became harsher for both Egyptians and refugees, Ahmed applied for resettlement to the United States. Egyptians have been very hospitable and very supportive. The weather is very similar to Syria. We speak the same language. It has been very difficult to make the decision to move out of Egypt, explained Ahmed. However, Ahmed has a medical condition that requires close medical follow up that is unavailable in Egypt. In addition, Ahmed was able to secure a job that only covers the familys basic needs. I cannot provide my daughters with better education or healthcare. Ahmeds wife, Nesma, described how it felt before she left Syria. I bid my family farewell every day before I went to work. I was never sure if we would see one another again. Home is where the heart is and my heart is in Syria. But the circumstances were stronger than us. Ahmed and his family are moving to the United States as part of the United States Resettlement Program facilitated by IOM. We know we will face challenges but I am certain they will not be as difficult as having to face death every day, concluded Ahmed.   *Names have been changed to protect the identity of the interviewee.
57	Ahmet	Eritrea	Switzerland	A	E	far	588	86919	H	im	male	I got on board of a ship in Libya which had to bring us to Italy. I couldnt take anything with me except the clothes I was wearing and a tiny little piece of paper with the phone number of my family on it. They told me to contact them soon after my arriving in Italy. About half way en route to Italy the ship overturned. It was already very old. My clothes were soaking with sea water and were getting heavy so I had to take them off. They disappeared in the sea. With them the piece of paper with the phone number. I survived together with about 200 others. Over 250 have drowned. Months after my escape from Eritrea I found someone in Switzerland who could contact my family. They thought I didnt survive the crossing by ship. The piece of paper with their number was the most important thing that I owned.
58	Ahmet	Germany	Germany	E	E	close	45909	45909	E	hc	male	My father came from a wealthy Muslim family in Turkey and came to Germany as a student. My mother was Catholic, from a workers family that lived in Würzburg. They were married in Turkey in 1955. I was born in Germany. I grew up with both languages and both cultures. For me this is an advantage. My parents never forced me to follow any particular religion. I was free to choose for myself when I was older. There was no fight between my parents about telling us to be this or that, whether there is god or goddess, he or she is above everything, etc. I could never understand that to be part of one religion makes you a better or worse person… this is not how a god or goddess would think. I learned a lot about both religions with my grandparents and I also enjoy reading the bible. It is a book of wonderfully interesting stories. With the contrast of my Turkish name and my German appearance, I face peculiar situations. For instance, people talking to me on the phone congratulating me  for my good German, since they assume by my name I am not German. My name is very unusual for Germans because when I say Ahmet, some people have a different image. There is this stigma that Ahmet should look darker and smaller. Ahmet works as a judge in Berlin, loves Istanbul, and the warmness of the people in Turkey. In Germany, Ahmet appreciates the good organization of the country and believes that we all have a lot to learn together.
59	Achille	Cameroon	Niger	A	A	close	1502	568	E	im	male	I am old. I left Cameroon back in 2000. I had tried for three years to get away, and I was sent back to Cameroon three times. I spent some time in Algeria and it was hell on earth - they say Jesus hasnt passed by there. One day I was taken behind a ghetto and shown the graves of those who didnt make it. I was asked: Do you want to follow them? Many people will try to discourage you, but when you decide to take this route there is no room for discouragement. I never had the European dream. I left because I was young, and bored of seeing and doing the same things every day. I had no idea where I was going -- along the way, I decided to try for Europe. Back then, there were no transit points through Libya, people mostly went through Morocco. On the day I made the crossing we were in the water at 11pm, and on Spanish land by 6am the next day. I had one life jacket. Five of us left, but only two made it to the other side. From Spain I went to France, then Italy and finally Germany. I made a life for myself there. I started learning metallurgy, I got married and had a kid. My parents-in-law didnt like me at all. In the beginning it was fine, but then little by little my wife started seeing it their way as well. Ive convinced all the Cameroonians Ive met during my return journey to go back home. Youre not going to find paradise abroad. Life is not the same, and I missed Cameroon throughout my time in Europe. Germans understand for example that you have something they dont, and they approach you and try to understand what that is, but some Europeans can be very racist. They sometimes even said it to my face: I dont like black people. Its not their fault, they arent used to seeing a lot of black people. We are always scared of the unknown. My biggest dream now is to have a family that supports me. Ill try to start a project when I get back to Cameroon, but if it doesnt succeed Im going back to Europe. You cant stay in Africa if you dont have any money. As for the route, they may close the borders but people always find a way. When you fill up one hole, another one is being dug.
60	Achol	South Sudan	South Sudan	A	A	close	1421	1421	E	hc	female	Achol is a local resident in Malakal town, South Sudan. Achol was originally from Jonglei State before coming to Malakal several years ago to work as a nurse. Malakal was such a nice place before the war, she recalls. Like most within the town, she fled with her family of 11 to the nearby UN peacekeeping base, a protection of civilians (PoC) site, when fighting erupted in South Sudan in December 2013. Once Achol and her family were able to safely enter the UN compound, she was able to find work as a midwife at a clinic in the site. Life became normal again. Well, as normal as it could be. I could work and provide for my family, Achol remembers. What small semblance of a normal life that Achol had would unravel in late February 2016 when ethnic fighting erupted in the site and she and her family found themselves on the wrong side of the conflict. Achol was faced with the hard choice to leave the PoC site following the clashes due to her familys ethnicity. Now living in a decrepit church compound with other South Sudanese from the Dinka tribe, Achol and her family are forced to readjust in their temporary accommodations. Even though I am out here, there is still a huge need for a nurse but it is difficult to work without supplies she stresses. I delivered three babies in the past week. Now her focus is building a future in Malakal town. I cant go back to the PoC site, but, honestly, I dont want to go anywhere else. Malakal is my home. Besides, I am needed here and I want to help.
61	Aisake	Tonga	Germany	L	E	far	4646	45909	H	im	male	My stepfather is from Düsseldorf and met my mother in Tonga where they both ran a holiday resort on one of the islands. After they sold it, we moved back to the main island of Tonga. Ever since my father wanted my sister and me to learn German, so we moved to Germany a few years later, when I was about 6 or 7 years old. First, we lived in Düsseldorf before finding an apartment in Berlin at the end of the summer. There I went to the International School and my parents ran a boarding house. When I moved here, I didn't speak German. That's why I didn't like my first year very much. However, when I began to speak more and more German I found a few friends at school, and started to like it better. During a holiday in Bavaria, I saw snow for the first time. In Tonga, there is only summer. Here I enjoy the different seasons. When I'm too cold, I wait for the summer and when I'm too warm, I look forward to the winter. My mother sees things differently. She doesn't like winter at all. That's why my parents will soon leave Berlin and go to Malta. But I'm going to stay, I love Berlin and it's my home.
62	Aisu	Kyrgyzstan	Hungary	I	E	far	1186	16129	H	im	female	I was born in a small city called Karavan, in Kyrgyz Republic. When I was six we moved to the capital, Bishkek, which is a very clean and green city. The air is fresh and its close to the mountains. The city is small but very homely. Even if youre a foreigner youll be greeted in a very friendly way. Id been to both Europe and Asia before because I was involved in shooting sports. As part of the Kyrgyz delegation I attended games and trainings abroad. Ive been to Singapore, Thailand and China. I liked them but I couldnt imagine myself studying and living there. So I chose to do my masters in Budapest. I decided to stay here after graduation which was a hard decision. When I got accepted it was set for two years, but now it's not that certain. The main reason why I decided to stay here is because I work in finance and investment banking and the size of the market is really limited in Kyrgyzstan, I wouldnt be able to improve my skills and to develop myself as a specialist. When I arrived in Budapest I had mixed feelings. [Along with my traveling group] I got a taxi and it was so expensive! Now I realize we were a bit fooled by the driver. The road from the airport to the dorms (in the outskirts of Budapest) wasnt what we expected to see. But then we went to the university in downtown Budapest and we were like yeah, thats what we imagined! I find people in Budapest to be very friendly. Once I was on the metro with a group of people who apparently looked like me (also from Central Asia), I dont know how it happened but I lost everyone. There was an old granny, she couldnt speak English but she was trying to ask me, Are you looking for someone looking like you? And she showed me the way. There were a bunch of other cases when people were willing to help which is nice, it reminds me of my hometown. I miss people from home, my friends and family, especially my nieces. When Im here for a longer period of time I start missing home food (My mom cooks delicious food!), but otherwise I never really feel homesick. Bishkek is less developed because it is at a stage where it requires investments in infrastructure. So in this sense there is a huge gap between Bishkek and Budapest. Budapest is really beautiful and not too big. Its a part of Europe but somehow I feel like Im home. When I was in the Netherlands I never felt like that. Perhaps my personality suits this city. I associate Budapest with academics maybe because I came here to do my masters. Living in Budapest has a different word selection that would be fun, beautiful, and nice times spent.
63	Ajmal	Afghanistan	Germany	I	E	far	508	45909	H	im	male	In Afghanistan I had many problems, because I am Hazara, and for other reasons as well. Thats why I came to Germany. My journey was really bad. I was in jail in Greece for 17 days and for 15 days in Turkey. It was horrible. Altogether I was en route for seven months. When I arrived in Germany I first went to the police. The police officer asked for my passport. He was really serious. So I told him I had no passport and then he asked if I took the plane to Germany. When I told him that I was from Afghanistan, he laughed and offered me a seat. It was funny. The most difficult was the language. A lady helped me. She found a German course for me and was of great help. Everything here was difficult in the beginning, but then I thought everything was very nice. I like the cultural differences. I am a very good cook and can tailor clothes. I like sports and am good in playing soccer. In the future I would like to get an apprenticeship to be a car mechanic. At the moment Im learning German and sometimes I help other refugees in a shelter for example with translations. Ajmals parents are dead, but he has a sister who lives in Pakistan. For him home and love are the same thing. He has been in Germany for a year.
64	Al-Haji Garba	Niger	Nigeria	A	A	close	568	2085	E	im	male	Originally from Damagaram, Niger, Al-Haji Garba came to Maidiguri, Nigeria 39 years ago, where he invested heavily in property deals and built his fortune. When he wasnt conducting business deals buying and selling land for profit, Al-Haji Garba was often selling land, homes, and even cars to locals at agreeable prices with no interest. If a man comes to me with a family and wants to buy a home for them but does not have all of the money right away, I give him a home which he can pay back over as long as he needs without interest. Al-Haji, which means the one who has performed pilgrimage, has garnered a name of himself within the community as someone who has consistently given to those less fortunate than him – a position that is often cultivated by Nigerias elite. From a young age, I always enjoyed what little I had. Despite the success I might have garnered over the years I never lost sight of helping those in need. Once he saw the influx of people from Mafa running away from Boko Haram, he decided to open up his land and allow people to build a displacement settlement on it. His own personal home is a sprawling neighbourhood featuring homes for his four wives and 38 children as well as homes for dozens of other people connected to his family, and even includes a Koranic school for children and youth. As a man with a strong sense of faith, he feels appalled by some people actions and their twisted interpretation of the same religion he himself uses to help others. I see these people, the havoc they cause and what they do is entirely different than what the Quran teaches. Whenever I find pupils at my school developing an ideology that is twisted, and they are not willing to change, I banish them because I do not want them to corrupt the minds of others. The contribution made by Al-Haji Garba is just one example of the significant private contributions made by individuals and communities to support the displaced within Nigeria and the Lake Chad region.

He left his home with his family 19 months ago where he used to be a farmer and businessman growing his crops during the rainy season and selling water from his borehole, as well as managing a provisional shop selling food. As a family man, I miss being able to address the various needs of my large family of four wives and 14 children, including being able to provide clean clothes. Despite this, I have little incentive to return to Ngala, as my home, crops, and shop have been burned to the ground. They came to my village in the morning when most of us were sleeping. Once they started to attack, the next thing I know we are all running for our lives. If they captured you or you got hit by a stray bullet, there was no one coming back for you. I didnt even know where my family was because we were all running in different directions. Thankfully, Mustapha managed to reunite with his family afterwards in a border town in Chad where they stayed for 11 months. Later, Al-Haji Mustapha and his family moved several times within North Eastern Nigeria before finally arriving to Maiduguri. Living in a camp means that privacy, personal space, and livelihood opportunities are scarce commodities. Despite this, Mustapha counts his family as one of the luckier ones; as they arrived earlier to the camp, they were able to live in one of the unfinished buildings in a sprawling housing project, one of several pending completion in Maiduguris suburbs which are now occupied by displaced people. These projects were never finished, and have been reallocated to those arriving in Maiduguri when the crisis peaked. Recently, I have seen so many new families arrive to the camp, but there are no more homes for them. I have seen pregnant women and children sleep outside in the open and it breaks my heart. No longer able to farm, Mustapha must rely on humanitarian assistance from outside sources to provide food for him and his family. I used to grow tomatoes, maize, and pretty much anything I wanted to put on my table. Now I have to accept whatever comes my way. I feel helpless."
66	Alaa	Syrian Arab Republic	Iraq	M	M	close	890	4146	E	im	female	"My name is Alaa Khayat. I am Syrian and graduated from Damascus University, Faculty of Architecture, in 2012. My graduation year was very difficult: I had to study with the constant sound of shelling and concentrating was difficult, but I was determined to pass my exams. After my graduation I stayed in Syria for another three years, but I was unemployed and had nothing to do. I could only wait for my visa to Erbil to arrive, so I could join my fiancé. Luckily, I started looking for a job in Erbil before I even left Syria, so when I eventually made it there I was able to start working straight away. Beginnings were very hard. I had left everything behind in Syria: my family, my lifestyle, my friends and my childhood memories. Despite the war, Syria was still home to me. Nonetheless, I was a newlywed and I wanted to form a family with my husband and pursue a professional career. I started working as an architect and also learned graphic design. I now work as a graphic designer in a company, and as a freelance architect. My double job, however, doesn't prevent me from painting. I brought my paintings with me from Syria and started painting again as soon as I settled down. Painting allows me to express my feelings and show how the war has affected me. Through my use of colors and movement, I share my feelings and try to pass on a message. With all what is happening in Syria, Kurdistan and Iraq, I want to tell people that colors give us life; although there are black backgrounds in my paintings, there is always light as well, there is always contrast. I also like drawing women, because they embody strength, and peacocks and horses because they always keep going and reflect beauty and longing for life. I want to tell people that even when life feels dark, it goes on. Even in war-torn countries, people can live, love, make a family and keep going. I am full of hope and want to share this optimism with people. My paintings are for sale, whether during exhibitions or privately. I would like people who buy my paintings to feel this message of hope, whatever their hardship in life. I would like to thank the Kurdistan Region of Iraq for helping make my dreams come true. Exhibiting my paintings was one of my childhood dreams and I have now fulfilled it thanks to its friendly, solidary and helpful people."
67	Alaeddin	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	male	When Alaeddin fled Aleppo, Syria, in February 2016, he was leaving behind his wife and newborn daughter, looking forward to pave their way to a safe life in Europe. After almost 11 months, he was among the first group of beneficiaries – for 2017– to be relocated from Greece to Portugal, under the EU relocation programme, implemented by IOM Greece. After arriving on the island of Lesbos and then going to the port of Piraeus, Alaeddin met a Greek family that welcomed him in their home and asked him to volunteer as a translator, helping with various issues concerning the refugee population staying near Greeces biggest port. He was the perfect choice, because hes a polyglot. Im fluent in English and Arabic and I also speak basic Greek, Portuguese and Chinese. Alaeddin said, smiling at our surprise: Back in Syria, I had a cosmetics store. I would travel to China to import products so I got to learn the language basics as I found it helped a lot. But, hes not your regular salesman: I have a degree in telecommunications and I was also studying economics which I havent finished yet. After volunteering in various camps around Athens as a translator he got a real job with an NGO, while waiting to be relocated. This procedure takes a long time really and I feel as if Im putting my dreams on hold,, he said. I know that Im off to a beautiful country with very nice people. Im really qualified and I would like to start working as soon as possible. I would really love to work as a translator, I have lots of professional experience now and a thorough knowledge on the refugee issue. Actually, if I had the opportunity to work for an organization such as the IOM, that would be a big start for me! he said with a big smile on his face.
68	Alavidze	Georgia	Greece	I	E	far	3984	18117	E	im	male	Given the touchy subjects of my books, my wife Julieta, my 22-year-old son Giorgi and myself decided to leave Georgia for Poland in 2013. I managed to write two books during the four years that we were in Poland, and one of them was even published in Georgia. My wife, however, couldnt find a job, my son was unable to continue his studies, and our asylum request was rejected. We started to feel unsafe and decided to head to France. But the authorities wanted to deport us back to Poland, so we had to pack our stuff and move once again. This time we headed to Greece, passing through Italy. We first stayed at the port of Igoumenitsa in Epirus. We were then transferred to Thessaloniki, where we lived in a hotel for a few months. We decided not to apply for asylum in Greece, and rather to move back to Georgia. IOMs Assisted voluntary return programme (AVRR) is the ideal solution for us. IOM also informed us about the reintegration package, which will facilitate our reintegration into the Georgian economy and society. IOM will also cover part of our rent in Tbilisi, which was added motivation for us. We love our country very much and are excited to have moved back. I will continue writing and my wife, whose favourite composer is Beethoven, will resume her music teaching career. She has extensive experience teaching in Georgian schools. My son will also be able to pursue his passion for computers and continue his IT studies. Prior to our return, we stayed for a few weeks in the Open Accommodation Center for AVRR (OCAVRR) beneficiaries. OCAVRR is a decent place to live, with good food and nice people. We left Greece with pleasant memories, but our future is in Georgia. Our dream is to move to a small Georgian village and start a family business.
69	Alba	El Salvador	China	L	I	far	3799	10229	E	im	female	When I arrived in China, I was so surprised to see how developed this country is, and how sweet and friendly Chinese people are. Everything seems very modern, the high speed train amazed me the most. What worried me was how to survive in a country where I do not speak Mandarin. Nevertheless, when she arrived with her husband, Alba had help from her colleagues and supervisors. It was a very relaxing encounter because everybody spoke English, a language I know, and also to learn that we would be taking Chinese classes.  We have met a few Latinos here and they all are quick to tell us the best places to shop for things like avocados, or where Latin restaurants can be found. China is modern and yet so different. People here are very safe as there is very little crime. You can walk the streets day or night without fear. Chinese people care a lot about each other and are quick to help others, especially foreigners. She definitely misses her family and friends the most, but admits: I truly miss my Jocotes, the best fruit in the world. I cannot find them in China. Corn atol and tamales are other foods that I miss. But I have no problem with pupusas  that we can find here.My husband sometimes cooks them for me. My mother taught him how to make them and he is a great cook. Alba also took a bit of El Salvador with her: I brought two pictures of our Beato Monsignor Romero, one for our home, and another for my office. Beato Monsignor Romero travels a lot! Everywhere I go he comes with me. Also, Ive brought my folkloric Salvadoran dress, posters, music, a Salvadoran hat for my husband, and a Salvadoran flag to represent my country during university events. Migration for her is a life-time adventure as she learns more about China´s millenarian culture everyday. I love to collaborate with colleagues, and prepare worldwide students to be future global health leaders who will change the world for the better. I feel very proud to represent my beloved El Salvador in every endeavor and achievement I gain.
70	Alban	France	Egypt	E	A	far	38959	3609	L	im	male	"I decided to move to Egypt seven years ago to start my own company after having studied six years in Montreal, Canada. But even after seven years, a full-time job and a company perfectly registered, Egypt still considers me as a tourist: I can't get a work permit or residency. So legally I am a tourist and I start believing so! Im on a permanent vacation, as film director Jim Jarmush would say. After having lived many years in western countries, what I love most here is the warmth of the hearts. This country happily welcomes people like me who wish to act for better societies and contribute to a better world; and I am thankful for that. People here want to know more about foreigners and how we live here; Once a TV channel willing to shoot a documentary to show that foreigners struggle to cross streets in Egypt, asked me to film myself crossing busy streets. After my fourth attempt, I nearly got ran over because the drivers were looking at the camera and the journalist! I really do like this country. I co-founded an Egyptian startup pioneering the Clickfunding. We launched a new campaign to promote social cohesion between migrants and Egyptians. It's a Match* was a big success. We received tens of thousands of clicks to support the distribution of coupons to migrants and Egyptians. I'm proud that a single click can have such a significant impact and promote peace and dialogue. To me, being a migrant means contributing to the country you live in. I just want migrants to be recognized for their true value, and to be seen as a strength not a threat. I have a job, I pay taxes, employ people, go to restaurants, buy local products. I'm a migrant.   This Clickfunding campaign provided 1,000 coupons to 1,000 persons. Half of them are migrants, and the other half are members of the welcoming host community. But before they can cash their coupons, they needed to meet their counterparts (either a migrant or a member of the welcoming community), get to know them and take a selfie together."
71	Albert	Philippines	Australia	I	O	far	3299	55823	H	im	male	When I was about four years old my family moved from the Philippines to Australia and weve been here since then. A part of my childhood took place in the Philippines and another part in Darwin, Australia. People are very friendly in Darwin, its a very multicultural place. I have great memories of my childhood in both places. Being born overseas but growing up in Australia has given me a different perspective. I have my Pilipino background but I have spent all my schooling years in Australia. This combination has given me a valuable understanding of being a migrant in this culture. I can bridge that understanding between new migrants and Australians. I now live in Sydney and work in the private sector. Since there are not a lot of people in my sector who have a migrant background, especially in high-level positions, Im challenged to encourage those who do to seek higher positions in the private sector. I believe in being open minded about migrants and different cultures. I have a really big appreciation for food from around the world. People often use food to learn about other peoples culture, and if you dont have many migrant friends, I recommend using food as a way to learn more about their background and make new friends.
72	Alberto	Spain	Viet Nam	E	I	far	27409	2786	L	im	male	I escaped Madrid to seek adventure, wisdom and illumination and got an opportunity to pursue a masters degree with an exchange program in South East Asia. After that, I changed into a much more open, wiser and happier person. That experience enhanced my perspective of the world, cultures, and individuals in such a way that I can never be the same again. It wasn't easy to leave my family and friends in Spain but they knew my place wasn't there. Fate brought me to Saigon, Vietnam. I love this city with every fiber of my body. For me the best part of Saigon is the people, which is why I try to learn Vietnamese to be able to communicate with them. I love how humble they can be while also having very strong, opportunistic characters. The good point is that Vietnamese people open themselves to you and make you feel like part of their family when you try hard to speak their language and give them a positive attitude and respect. Now after almost five years in Vietnam, I just don't see myself living in any other place in the near future. My lovely daughter was just born and I have my own business here. Here I can cultivate my passions and hobbies. Home is where there is healthy and delicious food, anywhere, anytime. Home is a coffee by the canal, with smiles of the kids and the friendly chatter of old ladies. Home is the feeling of freedom and simplicity. Home is getting lost with my motorbike…. Home is Saigon. So enjoy what you have, where you are, and live in the present as if there's no tomorrow. Be humble, enjoy the small things and details, things that your money won't buy. Seek experiences, say yes, don't be scared, listen, observe and learn. Drive yourself through tremendous acts of passion, life will pay you back.
73	Alejandra	Honduras	United States	L	N	far	2406	63123	H	im	female	"At the age of 26, I took the bold decision to leave my hometown in pursuit of a job opportunity in El Salvador. It was a challenge and I have to admit that it was scary at first, but I knew it would mean personal and professional growth for me. Now, at 32, Ive worked in 3 different countries as an employee of the same telecommunications company. Getting to the position of Regional Manager wasnt easy; I quickly realized that in order to standout in the global work market I had to gain expertise in specific fields. However, working in multicultural environments was a great starting point for me because I got to learn different skills, perspectives and best practice techniques from people all around the globe. I dont just apply them in my job, but also in my personal life. I'm grateful for and satisfied with all the places my work experience has taken me. I've met wonderful people and learned a lot about their customs. I'm aware that if I ever return to Honduras, or if I get to move to another city, I can apply all my specialist knowledge to help guide any country's development with regards to the telecommunications industry. I think that Hondurans are highly skilled workers - we easily adapt to new and different environments. As the saying goes, we are 'good material for export.' When migrating for work reasons you must open yourself to new challenges or, as I see it, new adventures!"
74	Alejandro	México	Costa Rica	L	L	close	8326	12077	E	im	male	I am from Mexico, but I have been living in Costa Rica with my family for 10 years now. My dad got a better job offer and my mom wanted to go to Costa Rica, so they decided to come. Back then, I was a child and it was very difficult to leave and say goodbye to all my friends. Before moving to Costa Rica, I had the wrong idea about this country. I thought that we were going to have monkeys throwing fruit at us in our garden and that we were going to find snakes on the sidewalk. Of course, I was exaggerating a bit. The moment I got here I started to make some friends and I felt really at home because as a child I was not fully aware we were living abroad. At the beginning, culture shock did not affect me so much, but over the years that changed. When I was 12, my classmates started to tell me that I wasnt from Costa Rica. We as children were very immature and other kids started to pick on me. The year 2015 was very difficult for me because el Chapo Guzmán just escaped from prison, many people thought Mexico cheated to win the Gold Cup, and finally, 43 students were killed in Ayotzinapa. Unfortunately, this kind of incidents were a reason for my classmates to associate me with negative things. At the end of that year, I decided to stand up and I started my own YouTube channel to upload videos with one single message: We are equal! I began by telling people from Costa Rica that I loved their country as much as I loved Mexico. Little by little, many Costa Ricans felt identified with my message and they decided to support me. I was in High school when I started my YouTube channel, and at first, I was a joke for my classmates. However, they came to understand the importance of my videos and a lot of them even made me suggestions or asked me if they could appear in one of them. The main purpose of my videos is to raise awareness because everyone should feel welcome all over the world.
75	Alejandro	México	Rwanda	L	A	far	8326	798	L	im	male	I was born and raised in Mexico. From a young age I was interested in faraway lands, attracted by their different languages, picturesque landscapes and buildings, food and traditions. I studied International Business, and during this time I had the chance to do a couple of international exchanges to the United States. This was the first time I was experiencing such exposure to the world, with colleagues, classmates and roommates from all around the globe, eager to share their culture and learn about mine. That sparked the wanderlust in me, and I knew I was not going to stay in my country for too long. When I graduated from university, I decided to move to Morocco, a country I knew nothing about. I found an internship there. Guided by travel books and websites, I prepared myself for a year of unexpected discoveries. In this new place that has so few similarities to my home country, I got lost among the flavors, colors, smells and sounds. Putting aside my occidental ideas and preconceptions helped me learn that what one considers to be the normal way is in reality just a different way. I made good friends in Morocco and, for the first time, I missed speaking my language. When my time there ended, I moved to Spain and made it my home. In Madrid, such an open and welcoming city, I found a place to explore and push my limits and ended up not only falling in love with a new country, but appreciating my own and gaining a whole new understanding of what it means to be Mexican. I found a job as a business journalist that allowed me to travel and live in countries across Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America and the Caribbean. In each of these places I gained something, but I also left a piece of myself behind. With all this reshaping, the fear of no longer fitting in emerged whenever I came back to where I started. When you arrive in a new place, you meet people with whom you establish bonds, you develop routines, and discover your favorite spots. You find your place - until it is time to move on. This has also taught me that goodbyes dont get easier, and bittersweet emotions follow you to the next destination. As time passes, the nostalgia about Mexico increases, but each time I go back I feel more like a visitor in a place that, in my eyes, refuses to change. The faces are the same, the rhythm and the vibe too… but I am not. And even though I am filled with joy every time I am in my home country, I cant help but perceive these visits like just another stop on the way. But my family and friends are there, as well as a unique folklore and the best food I have ever tasted, and these are all reminders of a strong identity with which I can relate and that I am proud of no matter how far away I might be. I am a migrant and I am happy to be one. My roots in Mexico hold me strong, but they do not hold me back. Whenever I decide to go back and settle in my home country, I will have a place, even though I would have to readjust to it. But I know its not yet time to return and as long as I can still go to new places, Id like to continue being amazed by new worlds. Through my personal views and based entirely on what I have had the chance to experience, I like to encourage people to dare to break past their personal borders. It is unbelievable what can happen when you explore new horizons and embrace what it means to be a stranger in a foreign land.
76	Alessandra	Italy	Switzerland	E	E	close	31238	86919	E	im	female	"My country of origin, Italy, is a country of migrants. For centuries, poor Italians left their homes to find a better life elsewhere. And they did find it, sometimes on the other side of the world: Argentina, Brazil, Australia, and USA. Yet they always had only one dream, to go back to Italy, build a house and live a decent life among their fellow countrymen. When I was young, on the contrary, my only dream was to leave Rome, which I felt was so provincial, so narrow-minded, and far away from real, exciting cities such as Paris, London, and New York; and I never wanted to go back. I fulfilled my dream, I have studied and lived in Geneva, married a French man, joined the United Nations Organization (where we are all migrants, in a way!), travelled for my job in Africa, Asia and Latin America, got four children who have three mother tongues, and have friends from all over the world. I have been a migrant all of my life and enjoyed every minute of it, but I don't forget my roots and feel very much Italian - and I try to pass over this sense of belonging to my children, while encouraging them to experience other cultures. I can see it is working, none of my children wish to live where they are born, and they are or will be living in another country. They, too, are or will be migrants! Being a migrant is being rich; rich of our own culture, values, skills, traditions, and of the cultures, values, skills and traditions of the country that welcomes us. We learn them, we absorb them, we transform them, and we make them better. We are all richer. Migrants are really an opportunity to the world!"
77	Alessandro	Italy	Switzerland	E	E	close	31238	86919	E	im	male	"I came to Switzerland as a student, to pursue my PhD in Molecular Biology. I had to leave Italy because there were no opportunities in my job field, so migration was essential to my livelihood. Unfortunately, it is true that several places in the world have become hostile to this part of the human experience, and many migrants experience hatred and discrimination when they try to do what I did. I have always tried to help migrants feel welcome, by trying to know and hang out with them, sharing my life experiences and listening to theirs as well. I have also supported organizations that help migrants. It's a journey that involves leaving your beloved ones, mixing with different cultures, crossing paths with people completely different from you and learning from them; but they have to learn from you too. This is the only way to make racism disappear. We have to respect each other, accept the differences that divide us, and fight against any laws that would discriminate against a certain group of people. For those who find themselves as newcomers in a city where people aren't used to or receptive to new arrivals, I would say no not be discouraged by racist people, because eventually, you will always find nice and good people in every country. Still, those living in the host country have a duty as well. Do not sit in your house being afraid of migrants - go out in the streets and talk to them! You will realize that they are human beings like you."

Being the kind of person who loves to study, I decided to earn a Masters degree. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to find a job soon after completing my studies. I started working as a professional in this field and was able to settle down and raise a family. I live with my wife and our five children, who were born here and feel fully Italian. When it comes to how I feel personally, I think home is where we are now but I am still deeply attached to my Ghanaian identity. My children dont perceive Ghana as their home; they are more European in that sense. My eldest daughter is dreaming about going to London to further her studies, like many of her peers. Although I lead a very happy life now, I must confess it hasnt always been like this. When I first arrived in Italy I thought I had made the wrong decision. At the beginning I was working as a gardener and it was so different from the job I had in Ghana that I thought it was not the right path for me. Back home, I was teaching at university: I was satisfied with my successful career. But once in Italy, I did not want to go back to Ghana, either. I currently work as a consultant on migration policies. I serve my community in many ways by scheduling counselling meetings to listen to my nationals problems and give them as much advice as I can. I ease the way for them to integrate well within the Italian society by explaining the countrys basics and making them understand the norms and regulations. When Italians ask me why I came here, I say: Maybe I came here to help you out! After all, by helping migrants, I am also helping Italy in managing migration as a whole."
79	Alfiaz	United Kingdom	Belgium	E	E	close	40718	45028	E	im	male	Im originally from England, but Ive been living in Brussels for five years, working for the European institutions. My great grandparents were from India, but my grandparents and my parents were born in Uganda. In the 1970s after Idi Amin came to power in Uganda, my parents had to flee the country as refugees and they went to the UK. Other members of my family are spread out across the UK, Canada and the United States. I would see myself as a British Indian – through my job and my residency in Belgium I also see myself as more European. But once your family has been forced to flee from a place, you learn to become a person of the world, rather than of a particular country. Home is a place that you can relate to, but it doesnt necessarily mean that you have to adapt to every single aspect of that country. Its not really defined by language, the colour of your skin, ethnicity, or race, its where you make your place. I did experience racism growing up in the UK, in the village that I grew up in, at school and at university. I have experienced hate speech and racist comments, but I havent experienced the structural discrimination that many people from minority backgrounds go through. Refugees and migrants coming to the European Union today are often victims of hatred and mistrust. When someone moves to another country there are so many things at play, they have to learn the culture and norms in the place theyre going to. My advice is to be resilient in order to handle all situations. There are incidents of hostility that can be faced in any new country, but we shouldnt let that hinder our integration.
80	Alfred and his wife, Immaculata	Kenya	Greece	A	E	far	1879	18117	H	im	n	Alfred and Immaculata are a couple from Kenya who have been living in Greece for a number of years now. The financial crisis that has hit Greece since 2009 and the high unemployment rates means that finding a job got more and more difficult for economic migrants and locals alike. After the arrival of their baby boy, only a few months ago, the couple decided to apply for the Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration Programme (AVVR), implemented by IOM Greece. My sister used to live in Greece, shes a nun, and through her I learnt many things about the country and I decided to settle in Athens about 5 years ago. Alfred joined me a couple of years later, says Immaculata. I lived in Nairobi with my older son and worked in a beauty salon. I came here in Greece hoping to get a job and provide for my family back to Kenya. I thought it would be different from Africa, a change for the best. So, I left my son with my mother and moved here. At first, it was really difficult to find work. It took me more than a year to finally get a job as a live-in nanny. I used to be a lorry driver in Nairobi, for a transport company. When I arrived here, I found a job in Mykonos, in a hotel. It was a good place. Id welcome the guests, take them to the airport and occasionally guide them around says Alfred. But, things are becoming harder and harder in Greece. We have to pay for all sorts of things but we cannot get a job, the stability that we need. Even buying basic items is a problem. And now that the baby came, we have so many more needs. Its not easy with the baby, I cannot stay with him because I have to work in a live-in job. But how can I leave my baby to go and live with another family? Hes really young, he needs me, I ll be punishing him. I have to breastfeed him, he gets sick. I have no family here to help me and I cannot afford a babysitter, Immaculata explains. So, we have decided to go back to Kenya, Alfred continues. We found out about the AVRR programme through some acquaintances and we googled it. And so here we are today, waiting for the moment to take the plane back to our homeland. And you know, my older boy in Kenya needs me, too. My mother takes care of him but he feels lonely, he often tells me Im not happy, I want you to come home. Hes 17 now, Immaculata says. However, other members of my family cannot believe we want to go back, they say no, stay there, dont come back to Kenya. But, when one lives in Africa, even when told that the situation in Greece is not good, they dont seem to understand it. They dont get how hard it is here, they dont have the first-hand experience, they cannot compare. Many of our Greek friends are also suffering under the financial crisis, some of them are planning to migrate to America. We will be given some assistance by IOM to start again in Kenya, so I hope to buy a used pick-up truck and start my own transport business, be independent and provide for Immaculata and the boys. And its always nice to be home says Alfred, smiling.
81	Alfredo	Chile	Norway	L	E	far	13232	66871	H	im	male	I was at the local store early one morning in late 1973, when I saw an army car pull up to my house, carry a man into it and drive off. As it drove past me, I recognized that the man in the car was my father, my sole caregiver. However, as a child of 12, I could not fully comprehend what had just happened. I went back home, only to find that it had been turned upside down and my father was nowhere to be seen. I picked up my fathers shirt that was laying on the bed and smelled it and all of a sudden, my fathers absence sunk in. It was the saddest moment in my life. Gathering my wits, I hitchhiked to the nearest city and stayed with some of my fathers friends. A month later, some of them were executed by the army. Everyone was terrified by the events that were unfolding in Chile. Realizing I was endangering my fathers friends by staying with them, I decided to leave. Thus began a new chapter in my life –surviving on the streets, sleeping in river beds, in dirt, covering myself with sand. I even woke up once to find rats around me, but I was beyond caring and continued sleeping. A few weeks later I found out that my father was still alive. He had been arrested, interrogated, beaten badly and sentenced to 11 years in prison. My father was not a political figure, but he witnessed the social injustice in Chile and wanted to be someone who would do the right thing. After speaking to some friends, I figured out the procedure that would allow me to visit my father in prison. I had heard that cigarettes were useful gifts for prisoners, so I brought to my father, the cheapest cigarettes I could find. During these visits, I lied to my father and told him that I was doing well. I didnt want him to know the truth. I didnt want him to know that most days I didnt know when I would be eating next, that I had mental notes on which friends I had asked for food recently and which I hadnt so I could plan accordingly, that once I even stole a hen to feed myself and that the longest I had gone without food was two weeks. That was my life until a man named Roberto Kozak* came along. He saw the suffering of the thousands of political prisoners in Chile and negotiated an agreement with Augusto Pinochet, to allow the prisoners to leave if they were able to obtain visas to other countries. My father showed me the letter he had received from the IOM [then known as ICEM] explaining the process through which we could leave the country. Suddenly there was hope. IOM organized the logistics and made travel arrangements, including obtaining passports. On 15 September 1976, sitting next to each other for the first time in three years, my father and I left Chile for Norway, with our newly issued passports that said Valid Only for Exit. As we flew over the beautiful Chilean mountain range, I was finally leaving behind a life of hunger, misery and solitude and my father was leaving behind imprisonment. Our lives recovered gradually. In Chile, I had terrible nightmares and would wake up in tears, screaming and sweating. In Norway, I stopped stuttering within two days, and I knew that the reason was that I was finally at peace and not terrified anymore. I ended up going to medical school and then went on to work on human rights issues, which is what Ive been doing since 1982. People often ask me what I have learned through all this. I have learned to have the capacity to listen to peoples stories and that no matter how bad things are, you can always give people hope and change their lives. This is what IOM and Roberto Kozak did for me, for my father and for thousands of Chileans – it gave us new lives. For a long time the unfortunate events of my childhood defined me, but I have slowly come to accept that Im much more than that. My experiences have made me perseverant and adaptable. It has changed the way that I look at things. I realized that we can recognize the humanity in ourselves and others, and that solidarity through small gestures such as the offer of a sandwich or a place to sleep can make a huge difference. My experiences have also empowered me to create similar opportunities and moments of hope for other people.   * Roberto Kozak was the former Director of the IOM [then known as ICEM] and helped over 30,000 political prisoners, including Alfredo's father, leave Chile and start a new life.

82	Ali	Iraq	Ireland	M	E	far	4146	86251	H	im	male	I was 14 years old when I moved here. I had never heard of Ireland before, but my aunt knew a bit about country because she worked as a surgeon and used to go to Belfast (Northern Ireland) and worked in Dublin occasionally. She recommended Ireland as a place to study and go to school. It was tough at first because I didnt know anyone. I was in a new country and my parents werent with me. It took a while, but I adapted when I started going to school and started having Irish friends. I had been happy at home before coming to Ireland, but I chose to be spontaneous. Well, rather my parents chose to be spontaneous and sent me to Waterford (south-east of Ireland). When I first came to Ireland there were a few obstacles to overcome, because its a completely different experience and you dont know anyone – absolutely no one. Its kind of hard to adapt quickly when you first arrive and you are young and by yourself. However, I suppose with time I adapted, became more and more Irish. I suppose you can tell by my accent. I have made a lot of memories here. I have only vague memories from when I was young, but I cant really remember much, therefore most of my memories were made here in Ireland. I feel I brought my culture with me to Ireland, where of course there is a different culture. Now I feel like Im mixed culture – an inbetweener lets say. I have a mixture of cultures between English, Iraqi and Irish. Its good and bad in a way, it has its ups and downs but thats what I would say – I brought a different culture.
83	Ali	Iraq	United States	M	N	far	4146	63123	H	im	male	I left Iraq with my parents and younger brother in November 2006 because we feared for our lives. The security situation had deteriorated horribly in Iraq, and the sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shiites was worsening. We were among the last to leave our neighbourhood, but we were compelled to flee after Al Qaeda took control of the area. They sent us death threats when I refused to join them. We left for Egypt and only six months after arriving, my father passed away. He needed an urgent heart operation and because it took time before we were able to collect the necessary funds, he did not make it. Facing many challenges in finding a proper job and sustaining a decent living standard, we decided to apply for resettlement. It took us roughly eight years to finally be resettled to the USA. Although we appreciate the support and love we received from Egyptians during our stay in Egypt, it was quite hard to establish a career and lead a normal life there. The job market was very competitive, and being a foreigner made it even more difficult. Resettlement to the USA was the hope that we clung to throughout the years. After settling in, I plan to enrol in an English language class and will look for an opportunity to further build on my engineering background. I am optimistic. I have family members in a couple of US states, so I will reach out to them. Perhaps we can eventually establish a new home here. In the past 9 years, I learned one has to be optimistic and persevere. Change is the law of life. One should be patient and I was patient for nine years. I believe that if one is pure and patient, he will find his way.
84	Ali	Pakistan	United Kingdom	I	E	far	1167	40718	H	im	male	I came to UK in late 2005 and completed my MBA in 2007. After struggling to find work initially I got involved in DLR extension project which was start of construction career. Since then I have helped deliver some major civil and construction project in London and Kent, they include Crossrail Liverpool street Station, Medway River bridge in Kent and several other residential and commercial building projects.
85	Ali	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	male	I was born in Libya to Palestinian parents who fled to Syria when I was young. I was a refugee there, and I am a refugee here, for the second time. I really hope this is the last time. I left Syria with the help of smugglers. It took me three days to go from Damascus to Turkey. Then from Turkey I boarded a boat at night with 50 other people. We reached Symi Island in Greece in the first attempt after two hours. We were really lucky. I spent two months in Thessaloniki because it was very hard to get into Macedonia. I tried three times, and the last time I was already in a small village near Serbia when the police got me and sent me back to Greece. Later, I tried to go back there and reached Serbia again. I was so afraid they would get my fingerprints that I hid for two weeks. Eventually I made it to Hungary, then Austria, and when I crossed the border into Germany, I was caught and they took my fingerprints. They let me go but told me I should go to a camp to apply for asylum.   I was studying electronic engineering at the university in Tartus, Syria, but I could not finish my studies because of the war. I want to finish it here, but first I have to learn German. I like it here, its funny to see our differences. For instance, in Germany, people only ask How are you? and then they stop. But in Syria we say Hi, how are you? How is your family? How is your work? Where are you going?.,  we ask a lot of questions just to know if youre ok. I like everything here in Germany: the music, the parties, the law. And most importantly, people here know the difference between terrorists and refugees. Of course, I also liked everything in Syria before the war, but now everything has changed. When I ask my family and friends how things are going, they tell me that every day things are getting worse and worse. People here have to keep in mind that what happened in Paris happens in Syria. Every day.
86	Ali and his family	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	male	I am Kurdish and originally from Afrin, Syria, but my wife is from Aleppo, where we were living when the war started. We were in danger there and had no choice but to flee. We first moved to Afrin, but were forced to move once again in March 2018. That is when we started our journey to Greece. After travelling for three months, we arrived in Moria, which is located on the island of Lesvos. Our third child, Mohammed, was born here. We are currently staying in the open accommodation site in Oinofyta while our asylum application is being examined. Our first boy is four years old and our daughter is two years old, and we want nothing more than security, safety and a better future for our children.
87	Ali and Leili	Iran	Greece	M	E	far	11183	18117	E	im	n	When I met Ali, he was wearing plastic gloves and pointing refugees in the right direction. I was happy to finally see someone who could communicate with Afghan refugees. When I asked which organisation he was working for he showed me his drenched ankles. He had arrived on a boat from Turkey a few hours before. My name is Ali, I am from Ahvaz, Iran. Next to me is the love of my life, Leili. We met at a hospital after I had a motorcycle accident in Tehran and we have been together ever since. I had a visa to go to Germany but to stay with Leili, I had to travel illegally through Turkey. This is the third time I am a fleeing my home. When we contacted the smuggler in Turkey, he promised to take us to Greece for 1500 USD. We thought that by Greece he meant Athens. We didn't expect to arrive on an island close to Turkey, on Lesbos island. We had no other choice but to trust them. One night we were told to wait near a highway, we were about 35 people. The smuggler came and put us all in his van. We drove all night. We arrived somewhere – it was still dark outside - and walked and walked.. and we finally could smell the sea. As we were walking, some people who could not afford the smuggler and who had been waiting in the woods for hours, joined a group after the smuggler left. We were suddenly 45 people boarding the boat. An Afghan man started the engine, and it was still dark outside. He opened a box full of life vests, which all disappeared in a wink.  There were not enough life vests for everyone. People started fighting and some tried to resell their vests for 50 euro. On the boat, every wave shook us like a mad cradle. I saw my life passing in front of me. We had so many fears: fear of the sea, fear of police, of entering Europe, fear not to make it. We danced with the waves of the sea and we all prayed to our gods. But I can tell you that our common language was fear. At some point the motor stopped. The boat was too heavy and the engine was too weak, but we made it start again. As we went on we started seeing an orang line on the other side. After an eternity that was hardly two and a half hours we saw that the orange line was a collection of life-vests left behind by other migrants on the shore. We finally made it.

Since October 2016, Ali has been attending school in the context of the refugee children education programme. Sophia and Alexandra are two of the bus escorts who accompany the children to and from school every day. It was a matter of time before a strong bond formed not only between them and Ali, but with all of their children. Ali is a great boy, hes really sweet. Im not saying that because hes my favourite, he really is something else, Alexandra says. But all of our children are so nice, they shower us with hugs and kisses every day. Its such a fulfilling job to be their escort. We are family now.
89	Alice	Australia	Germany	O	E	far	55823	45909	E	im	female	My name is Alice, I'm from Australia and I'm 23 years old. I arrived in Berlin about three years ago and am currently doing my Master's degree in Public Policy in Berlin. I had already traveled through Germany a number of times before. When I arrived here, I quickly noticed how different Berlin is from the rest of the country. I think Berlin doesn't correspond to any of the stereotypes, which exist of Germany. It's incredibly cosmopolitan , free, and with lots of young people. For these reasons, I currently see myself here and nowhere else in the world. When I think of home, I think of Australia first. But when I think about it in a more rational way, I quickly realize that here in Berlin, I have all the things which make a home. A community, a job, and the feeling of having roots. Basically, home is where I feel good. Where I get the feeling that Im right where I belong. It doesn't have to be restricted to a geographic place. I think everybody can find a home anywhere that isn't restricted to the place you were born. I can still recall my very first day in Berlin. I had to take a test to determine my language level at the Humboldt University. And the first two people I talked to were also Australians. I was so disappointed! But now, they're my best friends. It was a very special feeling at that time. Being in an unfamiliar city, being on your own, these first moments when everything is new. In Australia, people tend to live in the place they grew up in. So they tend to become a little reserved. This is a major difference to Germany. On the other hand, Australians are simply incredibly friendly, you feel very welcome when you meet them. What I miss about Australia? Vegemite. It's a salty bread spread that is not available here. It's the best hangover food you can imagine. I sometimes think I underestimate how much, in everyday life, I am on the lookout for these small things which remind me of my home in Australia. I know I have an indestructible link to another place, regardless of how or how long I might live here in Berlin.
90	Alice	United Kingdom	Albania	E	E	close	40718	5181	L	im	female	"I am half English and half Welsh; I currently live in Albania where I work as a freelance writer. I left England aged 21 because I didnt like the country and didnt see a future there; I didnt like the weather, the people, the government, the culture, or the way society was. I spent 10 years in Malta before living for almost a year in Cyprus. I do not consider myself English anymore and I know very little about what life is like there. Instead I prefer to consider myself a world citizen, someone who can travel, learn, and explore. Whilst I am proud of my Celtic/English heritage, it does not define me. I feel I have more to give in other places. I came to Albania by chance, in 2017. My first impression of Albania was very positive; I loved the energy and the interesting aesthetic feel of the country. It instantly impressed me. I also had an incredibly warm welcome from Albanian people; this was something very special and was a big part of my decision to stay here. Home for me is Albania now. I dont miss anything from the UK! Well. maybe I miss English bacon, clotted cream, and the shop Lush, but that is really it! Apart from my job as a freelance writer, I try to work on charity and social issues; I am an activist particularly for the environment and womens rights. I try to give back all that I can and to use the skills and influence that I have for a good purpose. I enjoy having the ability to make people see beautiful things in their country, that they may have previously taken for granted. These things give me immense happiness and a feeling of purpose - I thrive from them and this motivates me every day. To all my fellow Britons, there is a piece of advice that I would like to give: There is a whole world out there — go, explore, learn, travel, drink in the experiences that life has for you, meet people from every culture and background and expand your mind beyond what the media tells you. And to my fellow Albanians, I would like to say that whilst life may be hard for many of you, you are so blessed in a number of other ways. Your culture, your character, the beautiful surroundings that you inhabit — you have more in many ways than the countries you dream of escaping to. Remember that the grass is not always greener on the other side."
91	Alieu Jallow	Gambia	Gambia	A	A	close	757	757	E	hc	male	My name is Alieu. I am 20 and I am currently studying at Bansang School, in Grade 12. I left The Gambia in late 2019 because I wanted to improve my fathers life and to support the family. I was beaten across the desert and I experienced hunger. I returned from Algeria in February 2020, after a two month-journey through Senegal, Mali and Algeria. I decided to come back home to study when I realized that crossing the Mediterranean Sea was not as easy as I imagined. I faced stigma when I returned but I immediately started school again. This helped me a lot to find my place in the community and be concentrated on what I want to do in life. As the first child of 11 sons, all my brothers and sisters are going to school. The family is very supportive, and my father encourages us to be good students. I want to study law and become a lawyer in Bansang to support the community. It has been my dream to study law since Grade 7, inspired by a former Minister of Justice from my village, just on the other side of the river. I have a particular bond with my literature teacher Abdolai, who is supporting me in my studies and is offering me food when I dont have the money to buy it. I study hard every day and night, meeting my classmates regularly to prepare for homework and exams. I would like to buy a bicycle to move from home to school instead of walking all the way. When I first read my favorite book, The Lion and the Jewel, I was inspired about the leadership of the main characters, and I grew motivation to become a good and respected leader in my community. I took part in an entrepreneurship course, which helped me to understand the dynamics of work and business. I shared the knowledge I learned with my family and community, to provide recommendations on their businesses. I feel privileged because I have books and I can study. One day, I will have a job that allows me to make a change in the life of the community members. I think I have inspired many people in the community with my story. If you dont experience the backway, you dont have any idea about the difficulties and the risks. One of my friends spent the last three years in Morocco and still cant cross to Europe. If you are in Europe without a job, it will be very difficult for you. If you find it, you can spend 10-15 years without seeing your family, and it will be difficult for you anyway.
92	Alieu Sisawo	Gambia	Libya	A	A	close	757	4243	H	im	male	Alieu Sisawo – (Gambian Returnee) I am proud of myself and I can say I am now a rich, young man. I left The Gambia in 2012. I decided to leave for Europe to provide for myself and my family, but the journey was the most difficult experience of my life. I am grateful to be alive today. After spending more than four years in Libya with unsuccessful attempts to cross the Mediterranean Sea, I returned home in 2017. My return brought joy to my family. My mother and a few family members were glad, but others described me as a coward. I didnt care what they said. What mattered to me was my wellbeing and my mothers joy. When I returned to my hometown, I immediately opened a grocery shop and enrolled in a nursing programme at The Gambia College. Being the only shop in the area, it attracted many customers. I used the profit to provide for my familys basic needs and my college education. I also used the proceeds to open two other shops. I am proud of myself and I can say I am now a rich, young man. I regret the amount of time – four and a half years – I wasted in Tripoli. I could have used it for something worthwhile.   Since the outbreak of the pandemic, business has not been the same. However, I cannot allow COVID-19 to ruin my trade. I diversified my business to include animal husbandry and started to sell my products at a reduced price. These activities have diversified my sources of income and attracted new customers amid the lockdown. As a nursing student, I regularly talk to family and friends about the dangers of COVID-19 and explain to them the proper hygiene protocols to protect ourselves from the virus.
93	Alina	Georgia	Thailand	I	I	close	3984	7189	E	im	female	I was born in 1990 in Sukhumi, the main city of Abkhazia, ex-USSR. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the situation grew more dangerous with a civil war in Abkhazia, we moved to Russia - travelling in the cargo hold of the plane. Once there, we lived in a studio with three other families. At the time, Greece was offering special asylum to ethnic Greeks and since my moms side is Greek, we took advantage of the opportunity. From the moment I got to Greece, I fit in perfectly. This sense of belonging helped me grow in confidence and I became very extroverted and outgoing. Living in Greece was great, but there was another change awaiting us. In 2000 we moved to the US because my dads siblings were already living there. I didnt fit in as quickly as I had in Greece. During my first year of school I was nervous every day. My aunt used to drop me off in front of my school and I would often get out of the car, vomit and then go to class. Thankfully, by the following year I was able to speak English pretty well and started adapting to my new life. Looking back, I appreciate every move and hardship my family had to face. I credit those experiences for shaping my studies, travels and aspirations. At the same time, I think I lack the sense of permanency that others gain from having a stable childhood. Since my family is scattered across different countries, there isnt a single place that I can confidently call home.  At least I know that I have people that will always feel like home to me.
94	Alioune	Senegal	Niger	A	A	close	1458	568	E	im	male	Once my father died, as the eldest child in my family, I decided to drop out of school and start looking for ways to provide for my seven siblings. I then moved to Dakar, found a job there and started sending my family money. After a year or so, when I had saved up enough, I decided to try my luck on Europe. I spent seven months in Algeria and a year and half in Libya. The first time they caught me in Libya, I was on my way to get on the boat towards Europe. We were about 60 people, half of them women. They put us all in a room with no windows and told us to call our families. I called my brother and he started crying. We both knew he didnt have the means to pay for my ransom. They beat three people to death in front of my eyes. I thought I was going to die in there. When someone came from outside to pay the ransom for his friend, I told them that we needed to attack the guard. We hit him and started running. I hid in an abandoned building until the following morning. The next day I called my mother to let her know I was alive. My brother sent me some money and then I worked for the next couple of months until I had enough to pay for another boat trip. After finally getting on the boat, I spent the next 15 days lost at sea. Once again, we were caught and put in prison. A few days later, we escaped. When we got to the city centre, we met a man who was looking for people to work for him, but when we arrived at his house we realized we were going to be locked up again. I told him I was poor, that my family had nothing, and that was why I had left in the first place. I kept thinking to myself God, what did I do to deserve this? After two months of torture, a friend sent me some money, and they finally released me. I managed to save up once more to cross to Italy, but we were stopped as we were getting on the boat. This time I only spent three weeks in prison. However, every day in there felt like a year. After escaping, I decided that I had had enough and it was time to go back home. I told my friends I was leaving, but they encouraged me to try again. Here I was at sea once more. I could already see myself in Europe. I really thought we were going to make it this time. Instead, I got caught and put in prison for the sixth time. I have definitely learned my lesson. I am ready to go home.
95	Alissa	United States	Germany	N	E	far	63123	45909	E	im	female	I grew up with all the Nazi-stereotypes. Even though I had studied German and knew it was not 1944 anymore, I was still surprised how content I was here. I felt very comfortable straight away. I was in Germany for the first time in 2008 as an exchange student, then in 2010 as an Au-Pair and since 2012 I am back to study for my masters degree. My grandmother is from Friedrichshain, Berlin and my grandfather is from Austria. They both fled from the Nazis when they were young. I grew up with them and always knew they had an accent, but it was never discussed at home. I was raised with this demonised view on Germany. Nazis. Full stop. And with a lot of Holocaust history. And then, when I started college, I wanted to annoy my family, or to push the conversation, and I started to learn German. All hell let loose. By now my parents even visited me here. My grandma still does not understand why I live here. Our conversation always ends with Do not marry a German. Well, thats the way it is. She is 90 years old. I had only studied German for two years before I arrived and all of a sudden I was at University with everything in German. I could hardly say a sentence and was very embarrassed. „I notice that as a white female American I am privileged when dealing with authorities here, like the Aliens Registration Office. But they call out my family name, which is clearly Jewish, there is always that funny moment: I know that you know, that I know….and I can see it in their eyes. But by now I expect this, it has never been bad. Only that aha-experience, this Oh…are you okay in Germany, this little Sorry- Moment. The culture in which I grew up had less boundaries by far. There it is more like Well see, lets just try. I hope my readiness to do so is sometimes helpful. If Alissa is ever to return to California, then it would be because she misses her family and the attitude towards freedom. To her home simply means love.
96	Alixe	Chad	Chad	A	A	close	679	679	E	hc	female	"I was born in China and two years after my birth, due to my parents job, we moved to Algeria. From there, it was France where I completed my primary studies. Eventually, I lived a year in Belgium, then much later, studied in Germany and Italy and again in France. After obtaining my baccalaureate in Chad, I learned German while staying in Germany, and then did a linguistic stay in Italy before starting my studies in Valenciennes, France, where I obtained my masters degree in Applied Foreign Languages (LEA) in Law and International Affairs (English-German), after which I registered in DESS Trilingual Negotiator of International Trade. In Valenciennes, I had to adapt to a different education system, that required me to be very independent. In addition, not being a scholarship holder, I had to find a job to support myself and meet various expenses such as rent, transportation, study fees, etc. I eventually managed to balance three jobs during the day in addition to my courses. Yet, this is the life of many foreign students, so the situation was nothing extraordinary. My diploma in my pocket, during my years of searching for employment, I was able to multiply my professional experiences, before finding the opportunity to return to Chad with a promise of employment won during a recruitment forum in Paris. However, it did not go as planned, but I persevered and found a job at the German Embassy as an administrative assistant, launched my free advertising newspaper and created my first marketing and training consulting firm. Eventually, I left the country, and five years later, with my training in communication to my credit and having taken a liking to self entrepreneurship, I returned. The desire to return to work in Chad or, even in Africa, in addition to the fact that it corresponds to my professional project, has been reinforced by the sentiment during my career that,  what we can do elsewhere, may perhaps only be a drop of water in the sea, while at home, it can represent a significant contribution. » Former Minister of Posts and New Technologies of Information and Communication, I am now involved in the private sector at different levels and am also a member of the Executive Office of the Network of African Women Ministers and Parliamentarians in Chad (REFAMP / T ), responsible for Commissions. I also support young entrepreneurs in their initiatives. Regarding migration, I think that being able to travel or even migrate, when the basic conditions are met, is an advantage because the journey trains and educates you. On a personal level, thats the benefit I think Ive received. Yet, before embarking on any travel, you must know why and how you are going; choose your destination based on your objective by being informed; know what you want to do there and make sure that the chosen destination will make it possible to carry out your goal because it is easy to get lost on the way or to be the victim of others with bad intentions. Leaving home is never easy and you have to prepare yourself to face many difficulties, including material and psychological ones. A person who leaves is not lost, but an asset, as long as he does so under suitable conditions, safely, is able to accept the possible failure of the experience and has the courage to return at any time and rebuild."
97	Alma	Albania	Albania	E	E	close	5181	5181	E	hc	female	"Alma is very busy all day long. She wakes up early in the morning and goes to a professional culinary class. In the afternoon she does an internship in a restaurant serving traditional Albanian food, while in the evening and in her spare time she looks for a job. Alma completed the compulsory school cycle, and although she would have liked to pursue her studies further, she was forced to drop out as her family could not afford her studies. At home, she helped her mother with the housework but the family relations were always tense. She eventually left Albania in March 2015 and migrated to Italy to study and build up a future, for herself and her brother, towards whom she displays great affection. She went to live with her aunt in Genoa but unfortunately, the aunt was unable to take care of her since her husband had been diagnosed with cancer. Since Alma did not have any other relatives who could help her, she ended up being hosted at a reception centre for minors. During almost six months of her stay there, she established good relations with her peers and the social workers. Today, she carefully keeps a few letters she received from them after she left. Alma would have liked to stay in Italy but soon realized this was not an option anymore. She therefore pursued an assisted voluntary return option facilitated by IOM, which supported her return by covering her culinary class tuition fees, and her internship at a restaurant and part of the rental fees. I hope I can find soon a job in a restaurant, so that I can be independent; I can continue my studies and be able to fulfill my dream of becoming a professional cook. This dream seemed impossible to me a few months ago. Now, thanks to the help I received from IOM and Different and Equal NGO, it seems an exciting challenge."
98	Almonzer	Syrian Arab Republic	Estonia	M	E	far	890	23106	H	im	male	Almonzer was born in Syria and came to Estonia as an international student. Almonzer quickly noticed that Syria and Estonia have something in common – both have been invaded by multiple nations over time. It was a big deal for me that the Estonian government wanted to build itself up on its own he said, referring to the efforts Estonia has made after its re-independence. I havent travelled anywhere else. I hoped to do so when I grew up, but then the crisis happened and it consumed all of me – all of my mental energy went there. Being active gave me a feeling of contributing to my society, which helped my thoughts not become occupied with all the bad that is happening. While in Syria Almonzer kept himself active. He taught computer classes to children with autism, workshops on conflict resolution and peace building as well as contributed to Mobadiron, an NGO helping Syrian community unite in its diversity by teaching them active citizenship, leadership and community development, conflict response and providing psychosocial support. One of the causes of whats happening in my country is that there was no real civil society. Civil society is one of these doors that enables you to get into whats happening around you – from cleaning your neighbourhood to giving feedback to your government. So when something bad happens you cannot point fingers as its a collective work and not a one man job. When I came to Estonia I prepared to present something about Syria that is different from what is happening on the news. Syria existed before the war. The real essence of Syria needs to be seen. At Tallinn University and at different NGOs in Estonia Almonzer co-organized a workshop Unity in Diversity and currently speaks about Syrian culture and history to Estonian teachers and students. In Syria I was trying to stay away from the bad stuff and stick with what really interested me. My whole life I have tried to do this. I enjoy the calm atmosphere in Estonia. In the beginning I was a little lost in my mind psychologically, and now Im starting to understand everything. I love the university. I can read at home or at a cafe. I am getting to know Estonian, which helps with having Estonian friends. I like how Estonians appreciate work and are straightforward, which makes it easy to work and talk to them. Estonians were born here and understand what being Estonian is. I was born in Syria and understand what it means to be Syrian. I love it and have nothing against it. Before making any judgement we should understand why people have a certain attitude, what their real fears are and how to help them. We need to acknowledge the history of Estonia, which is unlike the history of any other country. If foreigners are welcoming, then Estonians will be obligated to be welcoming in return. People are simple. They just need love and understanding.
99	Altanchimeg	Mongolia	Mongolia	I	I	close	4007	4007	E	hc	female	I spent eight years in Switzerland. One day, my mother called me: my father was very ill and she wanted me to come back to Mongolia to help her take care of him and provide for the family. I took my kids with me and we left. It was a long time since I had set foot in my country. Everything had changed. My kids adapted well and after a few months they were able to speak Mongolian. But for me, I must say, starting a new life was hard. My mother already had experience working in the watch industry. With the familys own resources and the additional support I received, we decided to open a watch retail shop. It is going well. We are now in the process of opening a second one. We are also planning to expand our activities and propose watchmaking lessons. I am happy to be back: I can see a future here.
100	Alya	Russian Federation	Bulgaria	O	E	far	10166	10058	E	im	female	Alya has been in Bulgaria for 20 years now, she first lived in the small town of Yambol and then she moved to Sofia, studied Arabic and became an IOM staff member and the leader of the youth Russian diaspora organization in Bulgaria. My mom and I first went on a vacation to Bulgaria and she said Oh, Bulgaria is a great country. You walk on the streets and you can see all kinds of fruits growing. I was ten years old and came here for the fruits. My mom had a friend from Russia who lived here as well. She really loved and praised the country, for her it was an amazing place to live. The people are warm, welcoming and emotionally involved, that is really why we fell in love with Bulgaria. What I miss the most from Russia is the house I grew up in. It was close to the woods with the famous Russian birches. When looking up the ginormous trees the wind would always be shaking the long birches. The sounds of these birches is what I really miss, it is something out of this world. In order to overcome the homesickness you have to find a way to integrate that part of your life in your current life in the new country. I wanted to preserve my Russian origins and that is why I joined the youth organization of the Russian diaspora. To overcome several barriers, for example language, I joined a theatre group. Because of the many activities not only did my accent disappear, but I was also able to develop my personal characteristics. The funniest thing was that if you pronounced a word with an accent, no matter if it was foreign or the local Yambol dialect, in this group you were obligated to pay a 50 cents fine. This obviously led to us practicing our pronunciations, it was a very effective tool! The theatre performances I participated in made me well known in the region and a local TV network invited me to present the weather report. I was doing this job for three years. At one point people started stopping me at the street because they recognized me. It was hilarious. That is how the little migrant became famous, in the countryside at least.
101	Amadou	Senegal	Niger	A	A	close	1458	568	E	im	male	I saw a lot my friends who had been to Europe come back to Senegal with money and build houses for themselves. A lot of my friends in France, Spain, and Italy, left without any papers and got them once they were there, so I thought I could be one of them. I left Senegal with my younger brother last year to try to go to Italy. I arrived in Libya and decided to stay there for a while because I already had a lot of friends there. I worked in a small boutique for a while because I needed money for the boat to Italy, but I could never save enough to pay for the boat. My brother died in Libya. He was 16 years old. They attacked him in broad daylight in the city centre. They asked him for money, but he didnt have any. When they had caught me before, I gave them everything I had. But he didnt have any money so they shot him. I was close by and I recognized the gunshot sound. I ran to see what had happened and saw he was dead. I called my family and told them the news, and they told me to go back home so I did everything I could to make it back. I met an old man at the border with Niger, and told him I wanted to go back home so he told me about IOM. I am really grateful I met him. There are so many people in prison in Libya that cant get out because they have no money. You have no money, you dont get out. Or you die. Its simple. We have one friend that died at sea. When we saw how he died, my friends and I decided it wasnt worth it. The route is too difficult nowadays. A lot of people die on the road. Maybe you make it, maybe you die at sea. This is how it is. When I left Senegal, I sold all of my dads sheep, promising I would replace them once I get to Italy. But I never made it to Italy. If I find work in Senegal, I will stay there, but if I dont, I might try my luck once more.
102	Amadou	Senegal	Niger	A	A	close	1458	568	E	im	male	"I left Senegal when I was 19 to start a big adventure. I was in Congo for five years, then Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Angola and Mozambique. I love adventures. Since then, I came back to Senegal twice; when my mother was sick and when I got married. Then I left again and I came back a year ago when I decided to settle down. I was doing quite well; I owned a shop and I was making decent money. I had heard that a friend of mine had made it to Europe so when a guy promised he could get me a visa for France, I sold my shop and put my faith in him. Unfortunately, he didnt succeed, but he told me about this boat that takes people to Italy. Only later did I understand what route I was meant to take. On my way to Libya, the car was driving really fast so we had an accident and I got burned. They toss you aside even for the smallest cold. I am grateful nothing happened to me. I have travelled for so many years that I have enough endurance. Once in Tripoli, we had to board a boat that was meant for 50-70 people and we were 150. The waves were huge and the wind was blowing. We were far from the coast already when we saw there was a hole in the boat. I fell into the water and swam until the Libyans tried to rescue me but I managed to escape. A few months later I found out that that friend of mine and his group had in fact been caught and they all got killed. They never made it to Europe. People lie to encourage you to go, but thats not right. There are so many mothers out there waiting to hear from their sons, but they wont because their sons are probably dead somewhere in the desert, in prison or at sea. People say slavery does not exist anymore, but thats not true. In Libya you work hard every day and you never get paid. If you dare complain, then it might be the last thing you do. If you cant afford your freedom to get out of prison, then they torture you to death. There are so many people that want to go back and have no means to do so. In my entire life, I have never endured the things that I have endured in Libya. If Libya is paradise, then Id rather be in hell. Every chance I get, I tell people how dangerous it is and that they shouldnt go. People need to hear the truth. The truth is you have three options: you drown, you go to prison, or you make it to the other side. I was hoping to make it to the other side, but God must have another life in mind for me."
103	Amadou	Sierra Leone	Niger	A	A	close	475	568	E	im	male	"My children wanted to go to school, but we had no money to send them so I decided to go to Italy. I sold my family house, the house that my father had built for us, and I used the money for the trip. I have three other children at home. I decided to leave with Mohamed, 18, and Moussa, 9, because we are the men of the family; we are the strong ones in the family. When we were in Libya, the driver told us to get out of the car; he said he wanted to make sure there was no police around, and that he was going to come back for us. He never did. We stayed in the desert for days. One day a driver stopped and asked me where we were going, and when I said Italy and he saw my condition, he advised me to go back. When I was 4, I got measles so I had to get some injections in my legs to treat it. My mom used to tie a piece of fabric around my legs which made them very weak and they eventually had to amputate them. I didnt have money for a wheelchair for a long time. I bought my first one after the war in Sierra Leone; I was 21. Before that, I was crawling. It hasnt been an easy life. My dad left and my mom had to take care of me all by herself. She sent me to school, but I had to drop out because we were very poor and there was no one to help us. I took a paper, I wrote something on it and I started begging. I thought my life would be better in Italy. Its not easy to find a job in Sierra Leone. If those that have two arms and two legs cant find a job, how can I? I cant even push my wheelchair for a long time because my arms are too weak. I thought that if I went to Europe, I could get help without having to beg. I used to watch movies and the news, and I guess I just assumed people would help. I regret not seeing Europe with my own eyes. I am going back without having achieved anything. I wanted my son to be educated – maybe he could have become president one day! I dont know what Im going to do once Im back. I have no option but to start begging again.   Mohamed: I feel sorry for my father. I have feet so I can walk, but he isnt able to do long distances in the desert. My brother was very weak as well during this journey. I had to carry him on my back, on my lap or on our dads lap. I regret taking this journey because Im not fulfilling my dream. I want to finish my education and live a better life. I havent decided what I want to study yet – I want to consult with my father first. My goal is to earn enough money so I can help out my parents."
104	Amal	Iraq	Iraq	M	M	close	4146	4146	E	hc	female	My name is Amal. I am from Qaraqosh, in northern Iraq. My family and I are Christians. We were forced to flee our homes almost two years ago when Daesh took over our towns. I was at church when they arrived. People started leaving the building one by one as their relatives came to get them in order to flee. I didnt know what was going on, and went back home.  The roads were completely empty. When they told me what happened, my husband and I decided that I would leave immediately with the kids. After we left, it was just too dangerous, and so my husband left the same evening. We thought we were leaving only for a week or two, so we only packed our clothes. When it became clear we would be gone for longer, we quickly went back to Qaraqosh, but only to take our documents. We left again immediately. We drove in the direction of Dohuk, and at one of the checkpoints, a policeman told us that if we kept going down the same road, we would run into Daesh again, When we arrived in Erbil, we came to the church, but they were already very full. People were sleeping packed together in the garden. When we arrived, we didnt even have food, but people in Erbil helped us get by. But two years later, we are seven of us living in a caravan. The children squabble a lot. We used to have a big house with plenty of space and a garden shop in Qaraqosh. Ive tried to grow a few things here, but the children always come and pick the flowers. My youngest son, who is 17, asks me why he should bother studying. He feels that his only option is to go to Europe. I dont think that is a good idea. Who would be there to welcome him?
105	Amani	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	female	The journey here was dangerous and very special. It was the first time for me to do many things: Getting on an airplane, a big boat, a small boat, a train, and 10 hours of walking in the woods in the middle of the night. I was scared when we were on this small boat in the middle of the sea. We were lost. In Greece we were in prison for 11 days like we were criminals. I dont understand, we were not criminals! When we finally arrived at the destination of our journey, Berlin, a friend gave us a place to stay for the night. There were already eight men in the room, but we were finally safe. I embarked on this dangerous journey because my life in Syria was terrible. I was in a very unhappy marriage, with an abusive partner. He and his family kicked me out of the house when I fell ill. My family didnt want to take me as a divorced woman. So I fled with my friend, who had been tortured twice and was afraid that if those people got hold of him again, they might kill him. He told me we could get married, and he would bring me to Germany later, but I told him I was going to go with him. Along the journey we got married and we will have a child soon. Life in the refugee shelters in Germany was difficult. We had no privacy, no door to lock and the bathrooms were a nightmare. Within the last 15 months in Berlin, we have lived in six different places. Now, we finally found a home, but its only one room for me and my husband, and soon well be three. I am happy, Germany is a new start for us. I feel like a teenager who has been given a new life. I think I fit in here, I learn quickly and connect well with people. So far everyone here has been respectful towards my religion and me wearing a hijab. In Syria, I felt like a bird and they had cut my wings when I wanted to fly. But now – migration is a new experience, it opens your mind and you are able to look to all sides, and I can choose what is suitable for me. I love my new life because Ive chosen for myself for the first time in my life.
106	Amedy	Senegal	Senegal	A	A	close	1458	1458	E	hc	male	I left to get medical treatment in Spain. When I recovered,  I first thought I could stay and try my luck there. I started working with my uncle, but as months went by, I considered returning home. Many people from my community in Spain told me: Think twice, it is hard to make it here, you may miss the opportunity to build something there. I was torn: I felt the urge to go back but did not know how. I found a solution after discussing with return and reintegration counsellors who helped me reconsider my future in Senegal. Upon return, my family saw that I was determined. They supported me emotionally and did their best to help me financially. It was heartening to receive such an encouragement. However, it was also a huge responsibility. I felt I could not fail them: I had to succeed. I now have a job working for a custom clearance company close to the port, in Dakar. It is a good start, but I dont intend to stop here. My goal is to create my own business. It is not easy, there is competition, and you need a lot of money to obtain a commercial license. For now, I am focusing on improving my skills and gaining trust from clients. I think that wherever you are, be it in Europe or in Africa, you can succeed. Here in Senegal, if you are motivated to work hard and have ideas, you can make it.
107	Ameer	Egypt	Romania	A	E	far	3609	12929	E	im	male	I guess I didnt get to choose to come to Romania, I could say that Romania choose me. When I left Egypt, my mind was set on doing everything I can to go to Germany or France but my only real option at the time was Romania and I didnt want to come here, but now I love this place and I want to settle down. At first, I was a bit afraid of living here, I came from a corrupted country where I didnt enjoy too much freedom and when I found out that Romania was the only country who offered me a visa, knowing its communist past and everything, I was afraid that I might encounter similar practices. I was a bit disappointed to notice the same corrupt system as the one in Egypt, however, Romania is a free country and people are very nice and friendly, which is why I would like to live here from now on. The mentality here is also very different, people are very open minded, and I like that, I like the traditions, the atmosphere, this is what really makes this place so special for me. It is hard being away from home, but I made lots of new friends here, they invited me to their places and introduced me to the local traditions. Although I miss Egypt and I think of how it used to be it is now hard to imagine ever going back there, things changed and not for the better. Maybe in the future I will get a chance to give something back to my home country but right now I am focused on doing something here, in Romania. I know that not everyone has the possibility of leaving Egypt, but I would advise those who arrive in Romania to stay, even if they might be tempted to leave to other places like I was. Like I said, I like to believe that Romania choose me, maybe this was my faith. I am now grateful to everyone who welcomed me here and made me feel like home.
108	Ameer, Ahmad and Rant	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	n	In late 2017 Ameer, a 28-year-old mother from Aleppo, Syria, found out that her family was eligible for relocation to Germany. Ameer left her hometown of Aleppo with her husband Ahmad and 4-year-old daughter, Rant, to escape war – her mother is still trapped there. On March 13, 2016 they arrived by a rubber boat on the island of Chios and soon ended up at the Diavata camp near Thessaloniki, where the family spent 3 months, hoping that the border would open. After applying for asylum, Ameer and her family moved to an apartment and got into the European Union's relocation programme implemented by the IOM. It was during the IOMs medical tests that they discovered Ahmad suffers from a serious heart condition. Ahmad, a carpenter, was complaining about chest pain when in Thessaloniki, but at the local hospital he was reassured that it was nothing to worry about. Ameer believes that its the war and the hardships of being a refugee that took a toll on her husbands heart. Now, Ameers priority is her husbands heart surgery. At the hospital in Athens, they proposed that Ahmad would have the operation here but we opted for Germany, since were moving there anyway, she said. Germany is the holy grail for the majority of Syrian refugees but Ameer is not among them. To be honest, I wanted to go to Sweden to continue my studies in biology, she explained. Shes yet to know in which city shell start her new life, and said well find out soon, during the cultural orientation session. All I want is to go there, get my husband back to health, learn the language and get a job. Ameer didnt waste any time while in Greece: she took Greek language classes (shes already fluent in English) and even got to work with Time magazine while they were covering a story in Greece: I did translation work for them but then I got more and more involved. I really liked it and hopefully the experience will help me get a job in Germany, Ameer explained.
109	Amelia	Philippines	Libya	I	A	far	3299	4243	E	im	female	After working for two years as a nurse back home in the Philippines, my husband found a job in Libya. I moved there with him in 1982. Back then, you couldnt find many of the things you might need, but I didnt find it difficult to live here. Life was good, and even though my salary was not a lot it was not expensive to live in Libya. I stayed there until 1990 when my first contract ended, then I moved back to the Philippines, but only for few months. I was able to get a new contract, so I came back to Libya. I have three children – two of them were born here. So, when I turned 50, I had a ceremony in an event hall which is usually used for weddings. Using 50 roses, I celebrated the occasion with my friends and family to thank God for reaching this age, and to show appreciation for having wisdom in my life and for raising good children. My kids used to work in Libya as well, but after the 2011 events, I sent them back to the Philippines. By then, two of them were married and had their own children. Now the situation is different here. Even though my husband officially has a job with the Maltese embassy, they have closed and now only give allowances rather than salaries. I love Libya and the people here have accepted me, despite cultural and religious differences. My stay in Libya will end when my contract ends. Im planning to go back home. I did what I had to do, I bought a house, gave my children a good education. Now its time for me.

I have a degree in Language and French Literature from the University of Damascus. I was a French school teacher and taught private classes as well. I decided to leave Syria because there was a very complicated conflict and to evade compulsory military service. I also wanted to continue my studies but in Syria it was very tough to go to University. Thanks to the Habesha Project* I now have the chance to finish my studies in Mexico. The changes have made me feel much more at ease. I have the freedom to study, I live in better conditions and can get to know the culture of a new country and its people. I am currently taking a Spanish course at a university to improve this language that I had already studied. I believe that the mere fact of traveling makes you learn and grow as a person. The solidarity of the Mexican people is the biggest lesson I have learned. * The Habesha Project is a neutral, not-for-profit, non-political, and non-faith based international Mexican and Costa Rican-led humanitarian initiative aimed at making it possible for Syrian students who have fled the conflict to travel to Mexico to pursue higher education.

For two years I have supported my children in Turkey.  I sometimes found work sewing here, but I was lucky to receive support from the local Turkish community.  They showed me true generosity. We are excited to move to Norway.  I want to work, definitely, but the first thing I must do when I get there is to help my son find good medical treatment. When the bomb exploded on our house, he was very badly burned. He cannot open his mouth. He cannot eat properly. I have to feed him small spoonfuls of broth so he can eat. He had three surgeries in Turkey, but none were successful. I love him so much, but it has been hard on all of us. I am so tired. In Norway, I want my kids to go to school.  Its time they all go back to school. I have a 16-year-old daughter who went to school up to 5th grade in Syria. But because of the trauma, forgot some of the most basic things.  She doesnt even know how to write her name anymore. What do I want most from a life in Norway?  A place to raise my children where they are safe and where they feel safe. I want my son to receive medical care and for all of my children to receive an education so that they will have a better life than I have had.

112	Amir	Iraq	Sweden	M	E	far	4146	53575	H	im	male	"Amir left Iraq at the age of 24 and resettled in Sweden after living for a few months in Lebanon and Turkey. I moved out of my country because both my sexuality and the activism I do are illegal in Iraq, and I wanted to resettle temporarily to be able to grow as a person and continue the work I want to do, until its safe again to go back. I love the mixture of cultures in Sweden. I live in Malmö where 170 nationalities reside, and I always enjoy listening to so many languages, the scent of different foods, and being exposed to a diversity of cultures. I always had an interest in multiculturalism, and meeting new people. Its beautiful to live in a small city of only 300,000 residents yet still be surrounded by such a diverse group of people all the time. What I miss the most about being in Iraq is the type of activism that took place there- the need for change and the energy the youngsters have there always drove people into starting and creating several projects. Most of the people I volunteered and worked with when I was there dedicated an enormous amount of time to these projects, not thinking about whether it was a weekend or a holiday. I want to grow and empower myself to be able to empower others. I want to use human rights as my avenue. There are so many important areas in life that we can use to improve life for everyone; but in my opinion, human rights always remain the top priority because everything else falls under its umbrella. Home for me is where I can be who I am and pursue the plans and the goals I have without fearing for my life. A place where I can feel secure mentally, physically, and economically. A place where I can go back to whenever I want without anyone questioning why I should be able to go back there. Home is where I can pursue my mission. After personally being classified under the category of migrant I realised how exclusive this term is. If a person moves from Paris or NYC to another western city, he or she wouldnt be classified as a migrant but rather an expat. It is much more likely that the term immigrant would apply to someone moving from the Middle East or Africa. For me, neither term makes sense. Im not an expat nor an immigrant; Im a person who was born and raised in Iraq, and now happens to live in Sweden, and this is where my current home is. When people say Each person has roots somewhere, it doesnt make any sense. Barely anyone resides where they are originally from. Humans have always moved around."

The family moved to Egypt for several months, where they applied for resettlement. When we first arrived in Egypt, we were relieved to leave behind the tension and danger of Baghdad. But after just a few days, the realities of settling in a new country showed up. Living in Alexandria, removed from any kind of Iraqi support network, the family encountered financial difficulties. But Ammar met a friend of a friend who was able to help them and smooth the transition. Now approved for resettlement and getting ready for a move to Texas, US, the family is full of excitement for the future. Were looking forward to everything. Ammar is keen to put his skills in construction to use, and they are both pleased that their sons will have an American education. Its in the kids best interest. Theres a safe environment, and rules and regulations that we dont have in Iraq. A person who has aspirations can find success. They agree on something else: We want to meet Americans!
114	Amy	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	female	I arrived in the UK six years ago. Although I am American, I moved here from Latvia, where I was living while completing the research for my PhD dissertation. I previously lived in Poland, so life as an immigrant is very familiar to me. My great grandparents arrived in America from Poland, Lithuania, and Italy at the beginning of the 20th century with almost nothing. They built lives for themselves in America, fully integrating into society. It was completely by accident that I ended up repeating their migration story, this time moving from West to East. In all of the places I have lived, I have followed their example, attempting as best as I could to integrate, while still maintaining my individual identity based on my country of origin. I was hired by the University of Aberdeen to teach and do research on modern and contemporary art, and my focus is on contemporary art from Central and Eastern Europe. I suppose my interest in that region stemmed from my own Eastern European roots. I love teaching in Aberdeen and in Scotland because we have large migrant communities and groups of students from Central and Eastern Europe who understand the context of the art that I teach. Because of the Cold War, art from that region is not often integrated into the art history curriculum, so at Aberdeen I am lucky that I not only get to share this new knowledge with students from the UK, North America, and around the world, but also those who come from the region where I spent so much time living and doing research. Because of the oil industry and our two universities, Aberdeen is a migrant city, which I believe makes it a rich and vibrant place to work and live. I am happy to be a part of that community.

Ana and Eri met in Albania in 1996 and a year later they decided to go overseas, to the USA or Canada. The plan was to travel first to Bucharest and from there continue to America but once in Bucharest they found jobs and slowly settled down. The salary in Romania was quite low compared to other countries, but their income satisfied their needs and also allowed them to support their relatives in Albania. Their first son Dritan, was born in Bucharest. During their period in Romania the family rarely travelled back to Albania. When Violeta was a toddler and Dritan was in primary school, Eri and Ana began to face difficulties. The supermarket they worked for closed and they were left jobless. They could only find temporary jobs and they could not renew their permits of stay, so they were forced to leave the country they considered their home. We tried everything to permanently stay in Bucharest, but because of the economic crisis and also of the lack of permits of stay it became difficult to find good and regular jobs. The last three years we lived in fear of being found by the police and getting expelled. Finally we decided to return to Albania. My father has managed to build a house, and we can live here with him, my mother and my brother's family. We started from scratch. This is why the reintegration support of IOM is so important for us, it gave us the first push, it gave us the confidence to begin a new life in Albania Thanks to this help, part of the harvest will be sold, while the remaining will be for family use. Once we will have the money to buy a second hand motorcycle I will start to look for a job in Bushat or in Shkodra. If I could go back 20 years ago I would not immigrate […] we have always worked hard and made a lot of sacrifices in order to get integrated into the Romanian society and culture. Today we must start it all over again. We are given a mid term strategy to start a new life in our country. It gives us the confidence in the future.

Australia is a beautiful country and very organised, that was one of the first things I noticed. There are many things here that are different compared to my country: people are a little more reserved, while in Colombia people are very open about their feelings and theres a lot of spontaneity. People express all their feelings, happiness and even anger.  Its hard for me to describe the best thing about Australia, I find that there are so many to choose from! I like the order in this country, politically and socially, and the fact that there are many opportunities for everyone. I like that people are very polite. If I had to talk of all the good things about Australia, I would probably never finish! I bring my background, my culture, personality and professional skills to Australia. Ive been lucky to have very good work opportunities; I currently work in an airline company as a corporate executive and Im proud to work for an employer that gives migrants opportunities to be part of the workforce and contribute to this country. I want to prove that we can make Australia better, and even though its already a beautiful country, I can keep providing better ideas, skills and experience. I want to keep working here, continue being part of the workforce, and keep developing professionally. I didnt speak English when I came to Australia, I could just say a basic hello, and that was a big challenge. It is so important to know the language of the place you move to. It makes a big difference in your adaptation. If your English is not good like mine was at the beginning, that makes communication harder. But now Canberra is home for me. A few years ago I would still call Colombia my home, I love my country and I miss my family, but now whenever I leave Australia I want to come back straight away. That tells me that my heart is here now."
117	Anand	India	India	I	I	close	1931	1931	E	hc	male	My name is Anand. I live in India. I returned to India after eight years in the Netherlands. I managed to stay there without papers all this time. Many of my friends had to leave the country much earlier. It was a rather sad ending to my time in Europe as I was caught by the police and placed in administrative detention the day before I planned to seek return assistance. I did well during those eight years. I shared a modest apartment and worked as hard as I could selling gift items. I earned as much working one day in the Netherlands as I would have earned working an entire month in India. But at some point I felt I reached my limit and missed having basic rights. For instance, my boss owed me a lot of money and paid me well below the Dutch minimum wage. I now run a small business with my nephew selling artificial flowers, including tulips, in a big mall in Pune. I like to have the tulips in our collection as they remind me of all that is good about the Netherlands. We faced challenges starting up the business but we are now up and running. Pune is an Indian city with a booming IT sector. This has improved the economy and created a middle class. The average income here has increased tenfold over the past decade. The money I make covers my familys expenses. My hope for the future is to expand our business by procuring products directly from China. We depend on the wholesale market in Mumbai at the moment, which results in less profit. Sometimes I think about going abroad again, but since the local economy has improved there is now less need to move. Should I decide to migrate again, I would only do so legally and with my wife and two children.

He found a job in Singapore where he works as a lifting supervisor, 6 days a week. Sometimes also on Sundays. As with many other migrant workers, it was mostly economic reasons that brought him to Singaporean shores. He used to work as a company driver in Dubai for ten years before moving back to India for six years. He has since been living and working in Singapore for the last four years. To compare between Singapore and Dubai? Anand just cant! the two places are simply too different. However, Singapore has more demanding work schedules although he is also paid much more here. The weather here is also better than sweltering Dubai. Anand has generally only positive observations on Singapore: Singaporeans follow rules. Thats what Anand likes.
119	Anatoli	Ukraine	Estonia	E	E	close	3557	23106	H	im	male	"I came to Estonia in 1978 from Ukraine. Estonia was a place for internal migration within Soviet Union. There were many migrants like me in that time. Estonia is a very beautiful country. Even if the person could not run further to the West from Soviet Union, it was still much calmer and safer to stay in Estonia, especially for Musicians, Artists, and Writers. Also religious people didnt have any problems here. Migration was also economical of course. There was stability in Estonia, people could feel well here. There were no such big and vulgar bribes as it was common in Ukraine for many centuries. Estonian people managed to save the goodwill. Of course it was a Soviet Union, but it was another Soviet Union. People who came to visit me saw a bit of a different life. We are people with our own culture, in my case the Ukrainian culture. When the Soviet Union collapsed, a lot of people had to decide whether to go back or to stay in Estonia. Many had families and work here and didnt want to return. I went to the head of Ukrainian church and said that I also would like to stay here and there is possibility to build a Ukrainian church in Estonia. If it happened that I stayed in Estonia, it was natural that I should create a sphere of Ukrainian culture for my children. So after the church was established the cultural centre was created nearby. My wife is a very good person, a person of local culture, more Estonian culture. Her friends told her that while all normal people build houses, your husband is building a church and that is not normal, but she supported me a lot – it was a sacrifice. You have to work hard yourself, if you invest yourself, other people see that it is fair and normal, and you will receive additional support from them too; some will come and help. The church was open in 1991. We are all different. It would be bad if I wanted to be Estonian. I always knew that I am a person with Ukrainian culture. My Estonian education helps me to show culture and art in a way that Estonian people would understand it, so it is also unfair to call me a purely Ukrainian Artist. It is very important to learn the language of the country where you live. Estonians are very careful in protecting their culture. I speak Estonian, I cannot say I have learned it fully, I just speak. Our home languages are Russian, Ukrainian and Estonian."
120	Andrea	Germany	Ireland	E	E	close	45909	86251	E	im	female	I went to Ireland after visiting some old colleagues of my stepdads. They were all very welcoming and invited me for the future. In 1985 it happened, my English skills were so bad that I would not have passed my German A-levels. So we decided that I should come here for a year, to work on my English and see some of the world – but I never returned to Germany. I was very naïve upon arrival. Dublin was the big city that had everything my little hometown didnt have, cool people who spoke English, a great music scene in a small circle, and everybody knew everybody. There werent too many foreign Au-Pairs, therefore our group was known all over the place. We all met at the English School and made friends with people we would otherwise never have met, from very different academic and social backgrounds. Often those were partnerships of convenience, but over time and shared experiences they grew into friendships for life. About 15 years ago, I specialised in importing Brezels and offering German-style catering. Therefore Im adding German food to Irish culture. I cater for some German institutions: the Goethe-Institute, the embassy, the German school, the Lutheran church – they can all offer German events with German food now. It is rather rustic, but the Irish guests seem to like it. Ireland is my home. Ive lived here for longer than Ive ever lived in Krefeld. Ive raised my child here. But my roots are in Germany. My parents and my brother are there, same as many friends. I visit them all several times a year. I only miss certain things about Germany, such as good craftspeople. There, they come when they said they would, and know how to do their job right. Irish people dont have the same work ethics. I dont feel like a migrant at all. Ive been here for more than 30 years. It is my home. However, unfortunately, it is easy to hear that I am a foreigner. I still sound like Ive just hopped off a boat, because I cannot get rid of my accent. If I want to go back? Hard to tell. I am 50 odd years old and sometimes worry about my pension provision. When youre younger, you never think about it, but now stories about poverty among the elderly stick with me for longer and I wonder if Ill be better off in Ireland than in Germany, or vice versa.
121	Andreas	Sweden	Cambodia	E	I	far	53575	1513	L	im	male	We believe the next generation of decision makers have an important role to play in the promotion of human rights in Cambodia. The old public car ferries with loud Khmer music takes you from the buzzling Phnom Penh to the Cambodian country side in less than ten minutes. On that side of the river I can drive my old Vespa on small roads through the rice fields, with water buffalos, barking dogs, friendly and smiling people, small shops with warm soft drinks and the occasional local hair dressing saloon. It is beautiful, extremely relaxing and during those rides I always appreciate that I have the opportunity to live in Cambodia. Even though a minor project compared to everything else RWI does in Cambodia, I feel very proud of an initiative that provides scholarships to young female students from disadvantaged backgrounds to study law. I am deeply impressed with the commitment of these young students. They are Cambodias future and it is a privilege to work with them and meet them for human rights sessions on a regular basis. It is unfortunate that the term migrant nowadays very often is associated with something negative. In general migration is a good thing. Migration normally contributes to economic growth and development in both the country of origin and destination. Through migration cultural diversity is enhanced. Understanding and respect among people are nurtured. A society can never develop in isolation and the exchange of ideas and peoples are therefore of key importance to any society. There is nothing new about that. We cannot forget that people living and working outside of their country of origin are particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses. We must always remember that States have an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all persons within their border. The citizenship or immigration status of the person does not matter. It is therefore important that States have relevant legislation and policies in place that do not discriminate against migrants and that such laws are implemented in a non-discriminatory manner.

In Cambodia, RWI is implementing a human rights capacity development programme focusing in particular on Universities and Judicial Training Institutions.
122	Andrew	Nigeria	Belarus	A	E	far	2085	6377	E	im	male	After he won a scholarship to study abroad, Andrew came to Belarus to study at the University of Medicine in 2004. I cannot say that I neither dreamed of becoming a doctor nor wanted to come to Belarus. When I was young, I wanted to become an engineer. Then when the opportunity to study in Belarus came up, I thought I shouldnt miss this opportunity. And here I am today. Of course, I didnt speak Russian. The other students would always help me and Im very grateful to my friends for their support. They are Christians like me, which made it easier for me to integrate into the society. At first I hadnt fully realize that I was moving to a different country. After feeling euphoric for several weeks I then felt homesick. Happily my studies became so intense that there was no time to think about it anymore. My wife is Belarusian. We are raising our two sons. We speak with children in both Russian and English. But I dont exclude the possibility that one day we might move to Nigeria. I love it here. I remember that it was difficult to get used to the local food as in Nigeria we eat a lot of fish that is always fresh. Moreover, food here is not as spicy as in Nigeria. It was quite strange for me that people celebrate here such holidays as Maslenitsa, or Butter week, a sun-festival symbolizing the end of winter and the beginning of spring. When I was a student, I participated in such celebrations together with my friends, and I remember how strange it seemed to me, as it was still cold outdoors and there was a lot of snow everywhere. Of course, Belarusian winters are still really cold for me. When I finally started my work as a pediatric surgeon, I thought that I would feel like a foreigner among my colleagues but I never had that feeling. Of course, there were moments, in banks or shops for example, when, looking at me, people thought I could not speak Russian. They would try to find someone who speaks English and realize I speak Russian. But now this is no longer the case.
123	Andrey	Canada	Georgia	N	I	far	43560	3984	L	im	male	Ukrainian-born Andrey immigrated to Canada with his parents at six years old.  Later, his love for traveling brought him across the globe to Georgia, where he spent six months working as an election observer. I fell in love with the culture, the people and the magical country. While working in Georgia, I met the love of my life, Natia. Just as the relationship was blossoming, Natias career took her to Kazahkstan. Life changed dramatically for me. I was rushing home every day after work so we could Skype. As I got to know Natia more and more, I realized this is the person that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. No borders could keep us apart. After Andreys contract expired, he reunited with his love. They went on to have a traditional Georgian wedding in Batumi where they first met. A year later we had our first child, the joy of our lives. We debated the merits of living in Canada or Georgia.  In the end we decided to open the first English-based kindergarten in Batumi. Natia and I really wanted the children of Georgia, the future of this beautiful country, to have an opportunity for a first-class education. Our mission at our kindergarten, Elmo's Club, is to provide an academically challenging and stimulating environment for all children, and to enable them to realize their full potential. I have reached a very fulfilling point in my life.  I have an amazing wife, who is very supportive and understanding. I have a beautiful daughter, who gives us our greatest pleasure. I am an owner of a thriving business that I hope will make a positive impact on the world. I live in a semi-tropical paradise by the sea, surrounded by beautiful people and culture. Of course, life is not without its challenges, but I hope to continue to grow, learn and make a positive impact.
124	Andy	Ghana	South Africa	A	A	close	2206	5094	E	im	male	I was pushed to go to South Africa because I was offered a job and I could not miss this opportunity. I immediately arranged my papers and accreditations that will enable me to work there, and off I went. Little did I know the mental and emotional challenges that would confront me, that came with living in a new country. It was a big change in my life. Everything was different, the language, the type of food, friends, the weather and having to adapt all came as a challenge to me. I had some of my family around and the Ghanian community who helped me accustom to life in South Africa quite quickly. Being in a foreign land where the perception of migrants is misunderstood you know you have to look out for yourself everywhere you go because you never know what might happen to you. When you learn that you are perceived as a threat to the society that you are part of, it makes your stay uncomfortable. My plan was to stay in the country a maximum of two years and head back home. Opportunities started flowing in. From working as a pharmacist in a hospital to owning several pharmacies changed the plans I had for my life. I realized that when God has plans for you, he will push you out of your comfort zone, you will move into a new life and you will succeed. For me, that is the beauty of my move. Although I miss our food and my friends that I left behind, I am happy with the new life I chose for myself and my family. South Africa is home now. Migration has taught me to respect and understand peoples backgrounds. The way you do things and how you say things is very important. It has taught me to be polite when you are in a foreign land and try to appreciate the local people as much as possible and treat everyone with respect. Although my two years stay is long overdue, I will go back home in a few years to retire and live peacefully in my own little corner.
125	Angela	United States	Bulgaria	N	E	far	63123	10058	L	im	female	"Angela moved to Bulgaria in 2004, 8461 km away from home, because she fell in love with the Bulgarian folk music. I was studying Russian language and literature at Yale University, and I saw they had a Slavic chorus. I went to the first meeting and they played all different kinds of music – including the Mystery of Bulgarian voices. I was amazed and fell in love with Bulgarian folk music since. After my studies in the United States I wanted to further study the music in the land where it was created. So I got a Fulbright scholarship and came to Sofia. For me, I had come to Bulgaria with a very romantic idea, coming from folklore, that people were wearing native costumes and singing songs. I came in 1996, which was a very intense year for Bulgaria. It was interesting for me to see contemporary Bulgaria and to see how my stereotype of the country was not very accurate. I loved Bulgaria and the music, but it was interesting for me to get to know what contemporary Bulgarians were like, what they were interested in and what they worried about, the whole transition into democracy and later the European Union; the whole culture in this super interesting dynamic time of change was not something I expected to see. In the beginning I mainly worked as a translator, I translated Bulgarian novels and plays to English. The last few years I have been with the Fulbright Commission. We organized study and teaching exchanges between Bulgaria and America. I decided to stay here because I like the people. I really like how the lifestyle is not as rushed here as it is in America. You have more time to hang out with people, more time for music, art, and for family. I just felt that the pace of life was a really comfortable fit for me. The size of the city is the same as Minneapolis, there is enough going on culturally that is interesting, but it is not too crowded."
126	Angelo	South Sudan	South Sudan	A	A	close	1421	1421	E	hc	male	"Angelo is a former shelter assistant who worked for the Danish Refugee Committee (DRC) in the Malakal UN Protection of Civilians (PoC) site. A Shilluk and a local resident of Malakal, Angelo knew from an early age that he wished to enter priesthood. For as long as I could remember, its been something I wanted to do. I even have the name for it! he laughs. Angelo went to Khartoum for his studies where he majored in philosophy. Returning to Malakal in 2009 he quickly realized that he had much larger priorities than entering priesthood. Being one of the eldest in my family of ten, I realized that I needed to look after my family. I decided to go back to work so that my brothers and sisters could have a chance at an education. A few years ago, Angelo joined DRC as a shelter assistant working within the PoC. For his efforts, Angelo did manage to see many of his siblings graduate from their various studies. Once the civil war erupted and the fighting reached to Malakal, Angelo was among the first wave of people who fled to the same UN PoC. When the rebels came into the town we had little time to pack and we just ran. Since arriving to the PoC in late 2013, Angelo and his family have rarely ventured out of the camp. Being Shilluk, it is very difficult for us to go into the town; it is not safe for us at all. I have only left the PoC once and it was to see if my house was still there. It was burned down to the ground with nothing left. It was all gone. I have never had any reason to go back since. This would not be the last time that he and his family would have to endure such a tragedy. On February 17th, 2016 fighting erupted within the Malakal PoC between rival groups resulting in the deaths of 18 people and the destruction entire blocks of homes within the camp due to fire. I was asleep at the time but then I woke to some people shouting and all of a sudden gun shots started going off from within the PoC itself. I managed to gather some documents and clothing and we left. Standing on the ashy remains of his home Angelo and his family find themselves displaced yet again. Its amazing really. It is hopeless. This is what many of us feel while living here; hopelessness. One of his main concerns is not just the loss of his home but the spread of diseases that might happen in the coming rainy season. With all of these people out in the open, some have even had to set up homes in ditches which are going to be flooded when the rainy season comes. Living conditions like this can lead to diseases being spread easily. An outbreak can kill even more people than guns. Now Angelo and his family seek shelter under a large truck near a depot at the PoC. We are all ready to go back to where we lost our homes but there is simply no guarantee of safety anymore. If there was a way to guarantee security, a change for us to get an education that could lead to work then we would happily go back to our sector block or anywhere that could offer that hope."

But I fell sick, and was not able to work anymore. I had two young girls who needed to eat so I decided to leave my country and look for work abroad. I came to Kuwait three years ago. I never had a problem with my employer, but there was another maid in the house who I had a lot of issues with. I ran away from my sponsors house because of the other maid, and went to a friends house. But while I was there, I started getting a really bad headache and one whole side of my body went numb. Id had a stroke, and was able to get to the hospital quickly. I stayed there for two months. Now, fortunately, I feel better, but I still have problems walking and using my hand. Im now living in a shelter. One of the women goes with me to my weekly doctors appointment, and I dont have to pay for anything. I wouldnt be able to pay for medical care without their help. I really want to go home. My daughters are both in school now but I only get to see them through my sisters Facebook page. I dont want them to grow up without me being there. And with my health being so bad, theres no time to waste!   Angie was able to seek assistance and reside in a shelter run by the Government of Kuwait.

I like living here because you can have a good job and make a decent life. Although I knew the Italian language and was familiar with the culture when I moved here, it was not easy to be accepted by the local people at the beginning. But then people get to know you better and forget where you are actually from. Its funny when people tell me I look Italian. I never know whether to take it as a compliment or an achievement like good! I made it, I look Italian! In the end, I have to say I dont feel Greek or Italian. These countries have no boundaries for me.
129	Aninda	India	Libya	I	A	far	1931	4243	E	im	male	"Right from an early age, I was good at teaching. My own teachers used to assign me to help the weaker students in class. From school age, I longed to teach, so naturally I became a teacher. As far as my profession is concerned, Libya is the third country I've worked working so far, after Eritrea and Ethiopia. When I first came to Libya in 2009, I was really afraid, but the people were very welcoming. I was really moved - they say, from cape to Cairo, the African people are so hospitable. I have experienced this in all the African countries that I've been to. The people are very welcoming. The first Arabic word I learned was Marhaba, which means hello. I used to think it was specific to Eritrea, but they also use it here. Sometimes, when I teach students, communication is problematic. I only know some Arabic words, so to overcome the problem, I get some ready-made Arabic notes with help from other teachers in the university. When I show those notes in the classroom, the students are able to follow me during the class. I have been lived abroad for nearly twenty years. India is a land of culture and traditions. Not the one you see in Bollywood – thats Bombay culture and its different. I come from a good community that cares about value systems. For example, my dress code is considered good, and I dont walk like a hippy. The dress code is also considered important in my profession as a university professor. I find a few things in common with Libyan culture and Indian culture; we dont shake a women's hands in India, and here some dont shake womens hands. Im based in a city east of Tripoli, where I teach. I only go to Tripoli during weekends to attend church. When I was in Eritrea, I normally helped the pastor. Im a lay reader, and a musician, so I help the band practice some songs. I got this gift from my father who was also a musician. He was very good, and he was bit known for it in my hometown. Once in 2016, as I was on my way to the airport, I was kidnapped. My driver alerted the police to what happened, so they managed to release me after two hours. The same night,  the police came to my place and brought me all the materials and papers that were taken when I was kidnapped. Unfortunately, that day I missed my flight and my ticket was not refundable, so it was a heavy loss for me. The thing I miss about being away from India is my children, I can go for months without seeing them. Still, I like my job even if we have been facing problems transferring our salaries out of Libya since 2014. But I think people here also need my services, so for that, I stay."
130	Anita	Philippines	Libya	I	A	far	3299	4243	E	im	female	I came to Libya in 1985, and spent my first nine years in a small town called Surman. I was working as a nurse in the citys main hospital. I came with my husband, when he first got a job with a company here, and my son. During my stay, God blessed me with a second child. It was nice to have a girl in the family. As our contracts changed, we also changed locations, and went to live in Benghazi. We finally settled in Tripoli. Im from Manila so it was great for me to move back to a big city. Its more practical to live in a big city as there are always activities and places where you can take your children. Tripoli also has a Philippine high school, so it was good for my children to study there. My daughter went back to the Philippines for her undergraduate studies. She became a nurse, like me, and then came back to Libya and worked at the same hospital as me for almost three years before she moved again. It felt good to see her following in my footsteps, as I could also mentor her to do better at her job. My son, who also grew up in Libya, used to work here. But because of the difficult situation, both of my children couldnt stay and moved to Dubai. My husband wants to move because he lost his job when the company he worked for closed. What keeps him here, is wanting to stay by my side. We are suffering just like the Libyans these days. To improve my situation, I work part-time after I finish with my main job, so we can afford to live here. Our salaries are now stuck, and we cant even transfer them abroad because of the economic problems in the county. Everything is more expensive than it was before. You see, I owe my childrens education, my house back home and my job experience to Libya. I can say that I love Libya, because it has given me lots of good things. During the revolution, doctors and local staff members asked me to go back home. I told them, this is my home, I cant leave Libya like that. But as I grow older, I feel that I will leave Libya at some point. And when I do, I will miss the Libyan bakeries so much – especially the bread. Its so good and different to the ones we have at home!

I came to Guatemala after I finished my studies at the University of Canada because I wanted to gain experience abroad. I had already known some Guatemalans in Canada who were working with me, and one of them invited me over for a few months to know the country and he let me stay in his home. Thats how, in September 2012, I travelled to Guatemala thinking that I was just taking a vacation. By December of that year, when I was scheduled to return to Canada, I wanted to stay. So I went to the Embassy so that they would authorize me to stay another three months to take Spanish lessons, travel and learn more. I am able to go back home twice or three times a year to visit my parents and I also go to interview new employees for the project that I work on. The most difficult part is always saying goodbye to my parents after I visit them. After a while, Ann Sophie started working with vulnerable populations, helping them find jobs in their country of origin.  Living in Guatemala helped her realize how important it is for people to have safe and equal work environments.  Since 2013 she has focused on supporting migrants from Guatemala who wish to work abroad and protecting their labour rights.

133	Anna Maria	Sweden	Belgium	E	E	close	53575	45028	E	im	female	Im really a true European: I was born in Rome, I went to a German kindergarten and a French school in Rome, and I lived in a few different European countries before moving to my new home in Sweden. Im truly fascinated by diversity and the melting pot of different cultures of this continent. Home for me exists in many different places, broadly I think it is wherever you think you belong. Borders dont define who I am and have never protected me. We are all united in diversity, and we have to respect it and be inclusive in our actions. As an Italian, I was elected twice as a parliamentarian in Sweden. This is one of the best examples I can give of feeling at home. I lived for 6 years in Sarajevo and in the ashes of the war there, I learned that you can never take peace or freedom for granted. Fear is stronger than hate, and unfortunately some politicians play up these fears instead of answering to the concerns of the people they serve. Hopefully the 60th anniversary of the Rome Treaty will be a good occasion to remember our history – after 200 years of war, Europe has known 60 years of peace. This was achieved through tolerance, democracy, respect of human rights and dignity. Through dialogue and empathy, we can rebuild this peace and freedom for all migrants, and society at large will be richer for it. It is time to change the narrative on migrants, stop talking about them as a burden and instead consider them as a benefit for our inclusive and diverse societies.
134	Annet	South Sudan	South Sudan	A	A	close	1421	1421	E	hc	female	"South Sudanese by heritage, Annet was born and raised in a refugee camp in Uganda. She moved back to South Sudan with her family, who had fled the country during the long civil war. It was the lead-up to the vote on independence that motivated their return, because your home is yours, you always think about coming home. When they arrived in South Sudan, their transition was not easy. This was the first time Annet had been back to her country. She and her siblings constantly compared the lifestyle and culture in South Sudan to life in Uganda, but with time we got used to South Sudan and it quickly felt like home. However, just two years after South Sudans independence in 2011, fighting erupted between political rivals and quickly spread throughout the country. The conflict has displaced millions, both within South Sudan and to neighbouring countries. Shortly after the fighting started, Annet started as a mid-wife at a displacement site in Malakal, a flashpoint in the conflict.  But she felt strongly that she must go: Staying [in Malakal] has exposed me to a lot of challenges. And I know, even if I have to move again, Ill be able to adjust. Growing up as a refugee, Annet can relate to these internally displaced persons (IDPs) she supports: It is my duty to help these people, I feel for them so much, because it is what I lived. Annet took it upon herself to slowly and methodically gain the trust of the IDPs. At the beginning, the women were unsure of my abilities; they would see me and think Im so tiny, how can I really be their midwife? She would visit them house-by-house and soon gained their confidence and trust. Now, whenever they arrive at the clinic and Annet is not there, many women will ask where she has gone."
135	Annie Johnson	Gambia	Gambia	A	A	close	757	757	E	hc	female	"My daughter, Rosamond Erica Johnson, embarked on the backway journey to Europe and returned home in 2018. When she came back, I was happy because she came back alive.   When she decided to return, it was her choice. This is why she didnt face many challenges; I didnt want her to regret her return because those are the things that are damaging a returnee the most. I welcomed her back with open arms.   Based on the causalities I was hearing, I was happy when she returned. People were dying, people were disappearing, people were manhandled, beaten and brutalized.   I supported her upon return. First of all, I counselled her, telling her that leaving for the backway and coming back home is not the end of the world. Since I am her mother, this was very helpful. We used to sit together in the evening, I told her some local stories. I showed her some people who faced challenges but persisted. I gave her my own side of my story. I said: Look at me. I am still alive. I am still moving on. With this in mind, Rosamond started to volunteer with her peers to sensitize young people about the dangers of irregular migration. This was making an impact in her life. It was a great lesson that all is not lost. Female returnees should be involved in raising awareness on migration. We are the backbone of many achievements but, sometimes, we are also the one who push our children to go in the wrong way. Thats why women should be involved – so that they will help other women make informed decisions on migration. Women can contribute to combat irregular migration through counseling their children about alternatives. I urge fellow mothers to help their children to make good migration decisions and shun the backway. Everyone is born under a different star. Do not push them into the wall of uncertainty. Let them find their own way and help them find that path, rather than pushing them to risky decisions. Rosamond is a volunteer of the Migrants as Messengers (MaM) network."
136	Anonymous	Iran	Hungary	M	E	far	11183	16129	E	im	male	Im from Shiraz, in the South of Iran. I was a mechanical designer for an oil refinery and petrochemical factories. When I was in Iran I had a political problem with the government. There was an election in 2009 after which the situation deteriorated so I had to leave my country. I went to Turkey and from there someone drove me to Hungary by truck. I didnt plan to come to Hungary, I just wanted to go to a safe place. It was dangerous in Turkey so my family paid for a truck that transferred me here with a group of other people. I was on the road for 6 or 7 days. When I arrived here I didnt know where I was. The driver told us to go towards the light that seemed like a village. He said once we arrived we could go anywhere we want so we did as he told us. But when we got there, there was only a gas or electrical station and nothing else. The Hungarian police found us and took us to a closed camp. Thats when they told us that we were in Hungary. It was a very tough situation because I didnt know who I was surrounded by, what they would do to us or what the situation was like. I didnt know much about Hungary. I knew a little about football players and when I was a child there were some buses in Iran that were imported from Hungary. But that was all the information I had. I met my wife here and we got married 3 years ago. Our baby was born this year. When migrants or refugees arrive to a new country they need help to learn the language and to find a job. But in the past 6 years only my wife helped me and nobody else. The situation has been very hard but I feel happy when Im with my family. I grew up in Iran, most of my memories, good times and bad times, are from there. I miss my family, I miss my culture. Fortunately I can adapt to any culture. But no matter how flexible you are in the end you still feel that something is missing. Food is something I can cook by myself but culture is whats always missing. If I hadnt been forced to leave Iran I would have never considered coming here, not even for a moment. But I had no other choice. For me home is the place where I feel free. It doesnt matter where. If youre not free, if youre under oppression you dont feel like youre home. Sometimes I dont feel at home here. There are racist views, but people dont have enough information. If you have information you can understand people. In the past Iran accepted refugees from Europe but people here dont know this. They think: Why did these people come here? They understand if you explain but generally theyre not open. They treat you like someone unwanted. A former colleague of mine called me a terrorist. He thought Muslims were all terrorists and thats all there is to it. So I sat down with him and told him about our history and culture. Then he understood its not true. And these kinds of things have happened several times. The past 6 years were hard but good as well. Im sad and happy at the same time. I lost many things in my country. But Im happy because I leant many things which I can teach to my children. I hope I can transfer this knowledge to a new generation.
137	Ansoumana	Senegal	Niger	A	A	close	1458	568	E	im	male	"I stayed in a Senegalese ghetto for three months. The smuggler kept pushing my departure date for Libya, saying that there was too much insecurity here in Agadez. As the date was getting closer, I realized I didnt have enough money to travel all the way to Italy so I asked for my money back. When he refused, I called the police and they took him to the police station where he promised he was going to refund me the following Friday. We went back to the ghetto together and I waited for the day to come. We slept in the same room and ate together every day so I was confidant he wouldnt betray me. When he didnt show up at the police station on Friday, the police said we were going to investigate together, and that if I ever thought I knew where he was, to call them right away. I thought he left Agadez for Niamey so I bought my bus ticket, and once in Niamey, I went straight to the police. I stayed in Niamey for three weeks to look for him. His brother told me to search for him at the bus station since thats where he looked for clients going to Agadez. Thats where I then found his partner and told him I was from Burkina Faso and was looking to go to Agadez. He then told me the person in charge for departures to Agadez had already left for Tripoli. I was devastated; I thought Id never see him or my money again. I went back to Agadez and decided to stay in another ghetto. As I was going in, at the entrance, among tens of pairs of shoes, I recognized his. I told the owner I didnt want to cause problems or for the police to know there was a ghetto there; I just wanted the guy to come out. The owner insisted he wasnt there, but I had already called the police in the meantime. They took him to court and he is now paying back for everything he owes me. IOM is taking care of me until this problem is sorted and I can go back. He never thought I was going to find him, but I did. I didnt want to involve the police, but I didnt have a choice, and Im glad I did. I wont try this route again. If you listen to the radio or watch the news regularly, youll see that people have started taking irregular migration seriously. Once I arrived at IOMs transit centre and started talking to people about what they had lived and witnessed in Libya and Algeria, I understood that it wasnt worth risking my life for Italy. My mom still thinks Im still in Senegal. She knows what this route is about so I couldnt break her heart."
138	Anwar	Egypt	France	A	E	far	3609	38959	H	im	male	"I arrived in France on 28 August 1973. I had completed my studies in Egypt where the educational system was fragmented and I didnt feel free to study what I wanted. I came to visit Paris with the plan to leave for London. And I am still here, 43 years later. I already had a certain idea of France before I arrived. I knew a lot of French people living in Cairo, and they told me about France, its culture, its values. In Paris in 1973, racism was not as harsh as it is today; it was less generalized because the economy was doing better. But still, the Algerian war wasnt over in peoples minds. Pretty often, people would think I was Algerian, and the glances became sometimes tougher. At that time, French people would perceive a foreigner as someone coming to take part in the countrys development and not as someone who would take their daily bread away. What has changed today is the attitude of political leaders. But sadly, they are the mirror in which the French reflect. We should build a counter-power, create bodies allowing to distinguish the true and the false statements in the political discourses and prevent impunity by making sure that the laws, especially those against discrimination, are effectively implemented. There should not be a double standard depending on peoples background. It saddens me to see how the atmosphere is deteriorating. In Paris, there is potential, imagination and assets to move forward, go further. But some of those who speak harshly about foreigners seem to forget where they, themselves, come from. A man is like a tree: without roots, it just falls over. My wife is French and my children live here. I am at home in both countries. My kids grew up with both cultures. I dont feel French but Parisian, and I never applied for naturalization. An identity card cant bring me more love than I already have for this country. Of course, I could return to Egypt. And many of my French friends who live there actually wonder why I stay here. I think that my heart just belongs to Paris now! Paris is a cosmopolitan and friendly city. People here are used to live together. I love this city. After 43 years, I feel much more Parisian than from Cairo and I know this city like the back of my hand. I have my little habits here: morning coffee and croissant, at the café counter near my office. Every culture is rich in its own way and we should feel like knowing what others have to offer. We should show more solidarity and help those who are suffering. If I see my fellow man suffering without reaching out to help him, I dont deserve to be called a human being."
139	April	Philippines	Australia	I	O	far	3299	55823	H	im	female	I have lived in Australia for 7 years with my husband and our daughter. I still remember the day my husband talked to my mother about us getting married. That meant I had to move to Australia. One of my siblings lives in Canada and another one in Singapore, so it was hard for my mum to let me go but she knew it was for the best and gave us her blessing. My mother said God had heard her prayers by giving better opportunities for her children to live overseas. But she said she now had to pray that they could all be in the same country. We are a very close family and it makes things harder to be all in different places. Moving to Australia wasnt easy. Everything was new, I didnt feel confident speaking English all the time and expressing my emotions. I dont have my mum and siblings with me and I havent seen my nieces and nephews in a long time. But other things make it the place where I want to be. My husband is always there for me. Our daughter was born here and weve built a home in Australia. The people I met here have supported me to adapt. I have met some genuine people, very willing to help. I had help to practice driving lessons for my license. That avoided a lot of stress, especially for my husband! Another thing that was a blessing was meeting other migrant women from many different countries. They have given so much to me and I am always looking for ways I can give back what I have received. I know people say there is no place like home, but home is where you make it and Australia is where I want to be.

I left home at 20, and when I first got to Switzerland I remember thinking 'Oh God help me, where am I?' Fortunately this bewilderment has worn off as I've settled in — I've regained the self-confidence that I lost when I left home, and moved close to achieving integration in the way I know home. I do miss my family and friends the most, but the decision to leave was ultimately the right one for me. Now that I have gone, I hope to bring a sense of love, peace, happiness and friendship with me to each new place I go. The peace part is the most important; wherever you can find it is a place that you can call home."
141	Arnaud	France	Estonia	E	E	close	38959	23106	E	im	male	"I first came to Estonia in the summer of 2016 to spend my holidays here, in nature. I went to Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, and visited the Lahemaa and Soomaa national parks. The following year, I was looking for an inspiring work opportunity and I applied for a job in Estonia. After two Skype interviews, I was hired; I've been living in Estonia since then. I love that the country is so innovative and creative; you can easily meet a lot of interesting people here. I think Estonians and French people are very similar, there's no big cultural gap. But there are some differences, especially because the French are much more emotional. Estonians can have a poker face and its interesting because they are very straight-forward but at the same time their body language doesn't say much. The French are less straight-forward and sometimes less honest about what they think, but their body language says more. Still, this doesnt affect the relations between the two groups. The people here sometimes see me as different, but its not a bad thing. I definitely feel at home in Estonia. After going to business trips, Im always happy to come back here. Usually when I go to Paris or London, Im so happy to experience big city life for the first few days, but after a week I miss being in Tallinn in my quiet neighbourhood. Another thing I miss is the ability to be in the middle of a forest in half an hour; in Paris, youd still be in the city! But I also feel like I have several homes — I feel at home in Tallinn but I also feel at home when Im with my family and friends in Paris or Bordeaux. Id say home is a place where you have built yourself a community: a group of friends, relationships, and a professional network. What I miss the most about France is the weather as it can be very challenging here! And each time I go to France, I bring some wine and cheese back with me. I also miss spending hours and hours discussing politics — in France politics is like a national sport. But living abroad is extremely inspiring as well. You can meet people from different backgrounds and life stories and its very enriching. When you live abroad and meet others in the same situation as you, you can build strong friendships fast because youre all going through the exact same thing. I dont see myself as an Estonian but when Im in France I often say we when I talk about Estonians and I defend Estonia a lot. I think having lived in different countries has made me a better person with stronger values. I see migration as something very enriching. And my mother came to France as a refugee — if my country hadnt let her in, I wouldnt even exist. When you meet a migrant, its important to know the decision to come to a foreign country is never easy. I was very lucky to have colleagues who helped me integrate fast, because they introduced me to their friends and we went out a lot together. The first days and weeks in a new place are the most important, you can feel depressed and lonely. Its important to take part in different activities and just stay true to yourself. People understand youre different and they dont take it badly, just let them discover your culture and replace their stereotypes with new knowledge."
142	Artur	Albania	Albania	E	E	close	5181	5181	E	hc	male	Artur has recently turned 18. He spent six months in Italy between Bologna and Padua when he was still a child. Like many of his peers he migrated alone to Italy aiming to receive the protection that the Italian legal system grants to unaccompanied children. Artur kept a picture of himself on his cell phone as a souvenir of Padua. After a few months Artur wanted to return to Albania. He wanted to stay closer to his older sister who had health problems, and help the family with medical expenses and other needs. His family were in difficult economic conditions and indebted as a consequence of his sisters' illness. They own a little plot of land where they built their small house. The land is close to the Lana River, which is small in Tirana but becomes more dangerous in the outskirts, where Artur and his family live. When it rains too much the river inexorably overflows and floods the neighbourhood Arturs grandparents very low pension was the only fixed income for the family, but his father now works in the construction field and Artur helps him. IOM supported Arturs return and reintegration with the purchase of a cow. Considering his familys economic situation, Artur has chosen a kind of support that would provide his family with an immediate income rather that improving his educational or professional skills. The family can benefit from the milk produced and the yearly sell of the new-born calves. Now, the total family budget has increased of a quarter. IOM help is useful, it allows us to partially cover our basic needs and improve our living standard. The increasing of our income gives us optimism for the future, I hope that we will have the opportunity to save some money to buy a small tractor in order to better plough our plot of land, said Sajmir, Arturs father.
143	Arundeep	India	Ireland	I	E	far	1931	86251	H	im	female	Arundeep only met her husband for two hours before they were married. Her father had placed a matrimonial advertisement in a newspaper and was already sifting through potential suitors when an Irish offer came through. Rajeshs parents had moved to Ireland in the 1970s and were now looking for an Indian bride for their son. Arundeep remembers how her father wrote a 500-word description of his daughter for the advertisement. It said, We have a girl of height 5ft with a fair complexion who has a good education and has been working for the last four years. Looking for a groom who matches with her qualifications and settled enough to support her. Usually the important thing with a marriage is that you belong to the same caste, but that was not so important for us, says Arundeep. What really mattered was he needed to be a vegetarian. Id never been to Ireland before. I had seen PS I Love You and knew it was a beautiful country, but I never thought: Im going to settle in Ireland. One of Arundeeps favourite things about living in Ireland is the weather. I know people here are always giving out about rain and dampness, but for me its gorgeous.

145	Asadullah	Afghanistan	Slovakia	I	E	far	508	19264	H	im	male	Im from Logar, did my Masters degree in Berlin, worked in Kabul and now am a PhD-student in Bratislava. After that I want to return to Afghanistan. Its always challenging to come from Afghanistan to Europe. Although I was accepted at University and had my scholarship, it took me two months processing my visa. I am a migrant, because I want to study. I came to Slovakia for studying purposes. I wish we had higher level universities in Afghanistan, so I didnt need to come to Slovakia or to Europe for studying. But its also good to study outside in other countries. So I learn about their cultures and can bring the knowledge from other places to my own country and serve my own people. I will take lots of things with me from Slovakia when I go back to Afghanistan. The knowledge I acquire here, I will share with other people through teaching them at university. So they can learn from my experience. And I will help other Afghans, who want to study at European Universities. I brought my own culture to Slovakia and my own style of doing things, my own style of studying. Actually Im very good with languages. So my fellow students get the message that Afghanistan is not all about war. What the media is reflecting is completely different. In Afghanistan, every day thousands of things are happening. But the media will only present the one explosion which happened. So people in Slovakia and Europe can see that Afghans are competitive, have talent, and can compete in every field – on a academic level, in sports as well as elsewhere. The culture here is really different. When I first came to Europe I had a cultural shock. We have to adapt to the culture here, without forgetting completely about our own culture. We still have our own culture in mind, but we dont problematize. I was in Germany for quite some time. Everybody here is living the words Dankeschön, Bitteschön und Entschuldigung. I really liked it here. Its just so nice! Home for Asadullah is wherever you feel comfortable and at peace. Asadullah is currently learning Slovak – his eighth language. After he finished his degree, he wants to return to his family in Kabul.   Written by Christine Strotmann
146	Asem	Syrian Arab Republic	Jordan	M	M	close	890	4283	E	im	male	Today Im celebrating the third birthday of my second life. On 27th of April 2013 I was trying to get two injured people away from the battlefield. I put them in the ambulance car, I did some first aid for them. When I was going back to the drivers seat a bomb hit the car and I lost my left leg. I thought that I would die. For a few seconds after the explosion I couldnt hear anything, I couldnt see anything. I only saw black dust. Five seconds after I started seeing all the blood, I saw my leg. I thought that maybe another shell would hit us and we would all be dead. Or maybe I would die because of the bleeding. Fortunately, I stayed alive. A friend of mine came to pick me up and brought me to the hospital. In the field hospital they did a surgery to stop the bleeding. The doctors said that I bled two liters in those twenty minutes between the explosion and getting to the hospital. A bomb explodes so fast, it feels like somebody hits you with a very large piece of wood. The shell was from a regime military base. There was a big Red Crescent logo on the car so it was obvious this was an ambulance. A year earlier I had started working as a paramedic. Since the beginning of the protests and demonstrations I wanted to help but not by carrying weapons or killing people. I decided to help by saving peoples lives. As a paramedic I help all people - civilians, people from the Free Army but also soldiers from the regime. I dont make distinctions, for me these are all humans. Im not related to any political or religious movement. We were helping everybody regardless of religion. After regime soldiers arrested my father and were persistently looking for me, I fled to a town that was under the opposition control. In that place there was only bombing and that was much better than the systematic arrests. I continued my work as a paramedic in a field hospital which was a former vegetables storage facility. That was the safest place in the area. The walls were really thick and it was underground. If the regime bombs that place it would still be safe. We were smuggling the necessary materials from Lebanon and Jordan. On a busy day, when there was heavy bombing, we would have more than 100 patients - women, children, old people. We had saved many lives. After the surgery my friends decided to smuggle me to Jordan to get proper medical care. The operation I got in the field hospital was done using the light from mobile phones and electric wires as stitches. I couldnt go to a government hospital in Syria because they would know the town where it happened and that I was in some way involved against the regime. I went to Jordan with another twelve injured people on the back of a truck. Two of them died before arrival, it took us three days to get there. I spent the next year in Jordan undergoing surgeries. The first two months I had 12 surgeries. New surgery every three-four days. After that I got a prosthetic leg an started physiotherapy. One thing lead to another and I got to know people who were involved in 3D printing. Thats when my life started changing. There was a small lab in Amman where I learned to design and print parts for my prosthetic leg. It costs me two Euros and takes me two hours to do that. If I need to order it through a doctor it takes two weeks and 50 Euros. When I started 3D printing I didnt have any prior knowledge in programming or modeling. I learned little by little and realized that this is the future for me. Technology and innovation have changed my life and I want to share this knowledge with everybody. Since last month, we started organizing classes for refugees and local people. We teach them how to develop solutions that can bring significant change to their lives - be it prosthesis, devises to help the blind and heart pacers.
147	Asmaa	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	female	My husband was a municipal employee in Daraa, Syria. On his way to work, one day, fighting broke out on the roadway and everyone panicked, and the result was a six car pile-up. My husband was severely injured. We were living in an area affected by a lot of fighting and decided that it was a good time to leave and seek safety and medical attention elsewhere. We drove south to Jordan where they sent us straight to Zaatari camp. We hoped things would settle and we could return home, but its been three years now. I arrived in the camp when I was five months pregnant. After living the first winter in a tent, where it flooded to my waist, I sold my gold jewelry to buy my family a caravan that measures 3-by-5 meters. We had to buy a tarp to drape over it, but it still leaks. Life can be hard in Zaatari – like survival of the fittest. The moment I set foot on the bus from Zaatari camp (to go to the resettlement processing centre), I was so excited. I just know things are getting better for us. Asmaa shared her story as she, her husband and their six children were at the resettlement processing centre in Amman, Jordan. They were about to become eight of the 25,000 Syrians to be resettled in Canada by early 2016. I dont know much about Canada, but I know it will be safer for my children. I hope my husband and I can finally have our own bedroom again, that we can have a room for the boys and one for the girls. Our neighbors in Daraa had a small garden they would let us sit in. I would like to feel free to sit in the sun somewhere in Canada. I've only had nine years of school, and want to master the English language so I can continue my education. Its hard to leave everything we know behind, but this is a better future for all of us, especially the children. My friends tell me not to hesitate – moving to Canada will be the best thing that ever happened to us.
148	Asoka	Sri Lanka	United States	I	N	far	3768	63123	H	im	male	"My uncle, who lives in the United States, came to Sri Lanka to visit us and travel around the country and I accompanied him throughout his visit. He was a generous man; he gave gifts to everyone but by the end of the trip, he had run out of presents to give and had nothing for me. I didnt mind but he felt bad about it. About a year later, he convinced me to come to study in the US. I thought he was trying to make up for the gift he couldnt give me. So 35 years ago I moved there. I brought only $5 that someone had given me for my new start. I missed my friends and family – and the warm weather! But I learned to be happy with what I have. Because I always have a positive attitude, I credit people to be inherently good and I tend to overlook things that can be misinterpreted as discrimination. I always say, you can catch more flies with honey. So, it might be why I never felt discriminated against. When I got to the US, getting used to the language was tough. I could not understand everything and the culture was different. So I listened to the radio, watched TV, and read the news. I quickly got my drivers license and used to help out my elderly landlady to go get groceries and do work around the house. She appreciated it so much that she stopped accepting my rent money. In 1998, when the owners of the company I was working for decided to retire, I took all my courage, skills and knowledge and started running my own company. Everyday, I try to help people out – sometimes I employ or give recommendations to other Sri Lankans who need a nudge to start a new life. Now, I am American. It is home. I enjoy the individual freedoms given to citizens. I still visit Sri Lanka once a year, and when I retire I hope to spend more time there but I will always live in the US."
149	Astrid	México	United States	L	N	far	8326	63123	H	im	female	I came to the United States when I was four years old. We followed my father who had come here earlier, to earn money to sustain us. We have lived in the United States for 24 years, but are still undocumented. Going to the US is one of my earliest memories. I remember being on a bus and then the river – now I know that was the Rio Grande. I had gotten new shoes just before, and was worried I would get them dirty. I was on a plank tied to a giant tire. I was not really scared, more excited to go see my dad – my mum made me focus on that. She must have been so scared. This was a journey that really shaped who I would become, but of course at the age of four, I had no idea. I have never been back to Mexico, I grew up here, went to school. I was raised as an American with Mexican roots. Yet, there is so much disagreement with me being in this country that I never quite know where I belong. I think Im too American for Mexico and too Mexican for the US. I remember one day I was in the laundry room with my mother when a man entered and yelled at her that she shouldnt speak Spanish and all sorts of abuse. She did know what he said roughly, but asked me to translate. I didnt, I wanted to protect her. Thats the thing: As a child in this situation you learn the language faster than an adult, so you feel like you should protect your parents. My parents tried their best to avoid these situations, but after all it happened, and made me more resilient as a person. Growing up it was never at the forefront that I had no papers, my parents shielded me from that. Yet, there were these situations, when I could do whatever I wanted, I could not get into a certain cheerleading contest or something, because I had no social security number – but of course I didnt even understand what that was. I am now of the age that my dad was when he came here, to sustain his family. My mum and dad never saw their own parents again. I wonder could I make this sacrifice. I am very grateful to my parents. I know they had it hard, people were exploiting them, not paying them for their work. Yet, they dont regret, they always say it was worth it, doing it for me and my brother. So, I want to fight for the rights of my parents and people like them. Now, of course things are difficult. I was always frightful when people knocked on the door. But then I think about my parents, who came here, for a better life for their children, not knowing what was expecting them, and they conquered that fear. I feel uncertainty. I dont know where my parents or I will be next Christmas. To me migration is a necessity and just natural. Animals do it all the time. Sadly though, a lot of people fear the unknown. I always thought the United States where a beacon of hope in this regard, and after all, I still do.
150	Augustine	Ghana	Ghana	A	A	close	2206	2206	E	hc	male	"I thought about migrating for a long time. Things are not easy here in Ghana. Even if you get a job, the wages are not enough to take care of your family. For seven years, I had tried to save money to build a house, but it wasnt enough. I believed life would be easier if I found a job abroad. It took almost four years, working at the timber mill and farming, just to pay for the journey. Even then, I didn't have the money to get the proper documentation, and had to travel through the desert. I knew the dangers, but I weighed the options and decided to travel anyway. I traveled to Niger, where I found a connection man for a seat in a pickup truck to Libya. There were 26 of us sitting in the back of the truck and at that point I really regretted my decision. We traveled for 12 days through the desert until we reached Libya. It was a journey fraught with difficulties. On the way, one of my fellow passengers was left behind in the desert when the driver discovered he had not paid. At one point, we didnt have any water for two days. I saw the stones marking the graves of those who couldn't make it across desert. We met others on the way who were stranded, left with no money. In Libya, our car hit a rock and the truck somersaulted several times. I dislocated my right shoulder.  With the help of some Ghanaians in Libya, I received some basic first aid. I was so scared of being deported, I refused to go to the hospital. But because my injury never healed properly, I was unable to work the three months I was in Libya. I was able to use the small savings I had left to survive there, but I hadnt enough to return home; I had to rely on the help of Ghanaians in Libya once more. Of course I am happy to be alive, but it was my dream to work hard and save money for my family - so when our truck crashed, all my dreams crashed. Once back in Ghana, my wife divorced me because of my disability. I was unable to support my three children. My daughter had to drop out of school and soon after became pregnant. I needed extensive medical treatment and had to visit many specialists. Now, I maintain the borehole for the Catholic Church. Seventeen years later, I still spend a lot of money on medicine. When people come to me for advice on migrating, I advise them to stay here. It's very risky, do not make this dangerous journey - invest in Ghana."
151	Augustine	Nigeria	Algeria	A	A	close	2085	3368	E	im	male	Every year, tens of thousands of West Africans across the Sahara searching for a better life abroad. Many of these journeys are cut short as migrants become trapped in a spiral of false promises, hardship, and abuse. Some of these migrants make it back home to tell their stories, hoping that other men and women wishing to migrate will learn from them. This is Augustines… Augustine Blessing Eguvwese was born in Lagos, Nigeria. The first of five children, he obtained a masters degree in mass communications from the University of Lagos before becoming a radio host at several local stations throughout the capital. In 2015, the downturn in the countrys economy left thousands of Nigerians unemployed. Augustine was among the unlucky ones. A year later, at the age of 26, he decided to leave for Europe. With the little money he had, he boarded a bus to Agadez towards Algeria. I just wanted to find greener pastures, something better, you understand? I wanted to earn enough money to jump start my radio career… In Algeria, I started teaching English and took up other jobs but was unable to sustain myself or send money to my family. During the three months he spent in Algeria, Augustine witnessed firsthand the discrimination that migrants were subject to. Dismayed, he began his way back home… Being smuggled, he recounts, was the worst part of the journey — sharing the back of a pickup truck with 30 other migrants, only to be stranded in the desert in scorching temperatures. To get back, we walked through the desert for days… There were 14 of us, some got sick and so weak that they could not walk again. We tried hiding from the sun but there is no place to hide in the desert. We had no food, we had our first meal when we arrived at IOMs transit centre in Arlit before we were transferred to Agadez. During my journey I got the inspiration to start up an internet radio station. I met 5,000 people at the IOM transit centre in Agadez, I met people coming and going… People who were kidnapped, electrocuted, and forced into prostitution, people whose brothers and loved ones were killed at their side… In Niger, he enrolled in one of the entrepreneurship classes that IOM offers to migrants at its transit centre. The class helped him learn how to set up a small business. When he finished, he was eager to get back to his mother, who had not heard from him since his departure. According to Augustine, a large majority of migrants dont know about the dangers that lie ahead when traveling via irregular routes and with the aid of smugglers. Upon his return, he knew he had to use his own experience to inform Nigerians about these dangers. I decided that as a journalist if I went back to my country, I would start a campaign against irregular migration with the use of social media and all available online tools. So Amebo FM Nigerias first online radio station was born. Amebo aims to sensitize individuals and communities, both at home and overseas, to irregular migration and safer alternatives. Augustine and his team are working to identify key drivers of migration, including unemployment. This has led to the development of skills-acquisition programmes and training for setting up small enterprises. He wants to encourage people to ask questions before deciding whether to embark on a journey to Europe. What does a migrant face? Is it legal or illegal to get to Europe? He also refers them to organizations that offer reliable information about job offers abroad. Augustine keeps himself busy. He has taken to other platforms to share his experience. At the 108th session of the IOM Council at the UN in Geneva, he addressed government representatives at a panel titled Migrant Voices alongside fellow returnee Fabiola das Neves Sfalcini from Brazil. Augustine has found the opportunity to relaunch his career where he least expected…, back home. But he is aware of his relative privileged position as a graduate, and is convinced that education is a powerful tool to help people make the right choices. I believe that education is a powerful tool. It helps people make the right choices. If you dont educate your people, you can never grow as a country. This is why people leave.
152	Augustine	Nigeria	Niger	A	A	close	2085	568	E	im	male	Due to the economic crisis, myself and other millions of Nigerians lost our jobs last year. I used to work as a journalist and media consultant. Nigeria couldnt export oil so there was no money. They are now trying to diversify the economy, but it will take a long time. Seeing as there were no jobs, with the little money we had, we went looking for work abroad. I decided to go to Algeria hoping to find better opportunities. For the three months I was there, I was teaching English and doing some other small jobs as well. I witnessed a lot of discrimination and a fragile justice system during my time there. I wanted to earn enough money to jumpstart my radio career, but there just werent enough jobs so I decided to go back home. On the way back, they dropped us off in the desert, took our bags and money, and my camera. I had to take on a few manual jobs that I wasnt used to. I had no choice because I wanted to go back home. There was no one to help you, no phones to call your family. It was a painful experience, but also a good learning experience. In Arlit, a couple of Gambians told me about IOMs transit centres so I ended up going to Agadez. During my one month there, I learned French and took free entrepreneurship classes. On one hand, its sad because I left home empty handed and Im going back empty handed. But on the other hand, because of the classes I took in Agadez, I am entitled to a grant that has just been approved. Going back, I feel like everything I have ever dreamt of is coming to fruition. We need to sensitize Africa about irregular migration and its alternatives. Africa is a place of hope, of hard working people, we dont need to leave. What I learned from my journey is that theres nothing special about Europe. What they do have there is more jobs, laws that are being obeyed, and less corruption. Education is a powerful tool. When you educate people, they come back home. In Africa, people often dont have access to education so they can only do manual jobs. If you dont educate your people, you can never grow as a country. I, myself, want to work on my career before I start thinking about having a family.
153	Avedis	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	male	"This is the first New Year's Avedis celebrates with family in four years - his brother has already relocated and they are together again. After a year of applying to migrate, he is one of the privately–sponsored migrants who have been relocated to Canada. I left Aleppo, Syria for a job teaching English in a university in Saudi Arabia, using my MA degree in teaching English as a Foreign Language. After 3 years, I left for Lebanon in order to start my privately-sponsored refugee papers. In Beirut, I worked as a translator. Interestingly enough, translating in Montréal–Trudeau Airport was the first paid Canadian job I got; and my first day at work was my 10th day in Canada. Being fluent in 4 languages, I work assisting the Canadian officials by translating for the arriving Syrians.   I look forward to living in a developed country where job opportunities make use of my education and experience. I'm also hopeful that I will find chances to practice my skills in singing as a soloist and also photography. I had vocal lessons in Aleppo and did some cover recordings. In addition, I have practiced portrait and landscape photography, which gave me a couple of assignments in fashion photography in Beirut. A few days after arriving, I visited the Department of Education in Concordia University. I was ecstatic after being told I am qualified to apply for a PhD. I am also considering visiting McGill University, and will soon make up my mind on which university to apply to. Life in Canada promises me values I hold dear: freedom of speech and conscience, multiculturalism, social justice and equality, just to mention a few. I feel somehow as if I was taken away from Canada when I was a child, and now Ive come home again. I can't wait to be fully integrated in Canadian society, and am so happy I have already started."
154	Avnish	India	Italy	I	E	far	1931	31238	H	im	male	When I finished my studies in architecture in Rajasthan, I felt the need to travel within my country and study elsewhere in India. So I moved to another state and, in a way, I started to feel like a migrant. At university I was suddenly the only student coming from an outer state. It was special but I needed to experience more so when I received a scholarship to study in Milan, I had no hesitation and left for Italy. That was more than 6 years ago and that Im here now. When I walk to work in the morning, I observe my surroundings and contemplate the differences between the cultures I have experienced so far. In Italy, I am very aware of my foreigner status. But then again, sometimes it feels nice to be an outsider, to be different. I have been away from home for so many years that its hard to define where home is. Even back in India over the summer I don't feel at home and here, I lead a Milanese life as a foreigner. I might leave Italy someday and I am thinking of going back to India. Not because I feel a pariah here but because there are more career opportunities there. I believe that travelling is a way to learn and to grow. I feel almost greedy at times because I have this urge to experience new places. I have started to have this feeling again, so I am trying to figure out where will be my new home.
155	Awa	Senegal	Mauritania	A	A	close	1458	1702	E	im	female	In Senegal, I had been working as a seamstress for three years when one day, I told my boss I was leaving. He asked me why I wanted to abandon everything. I answered that I needed to take my mind off things, discover another country. I arrived in Mauritania and worked as a cook in a Moorish family for one year. The work was very hard, I left this job and went back to Senegal for the holidays and to think about my future. My dream was to open a tailoring shop but there were already many in Senegal. On the contrary, in Mauritania, they were quite uncommon and the market was still open. After these three months of holidays in Senegal, I decided to go back to Mauritania. My parents were against my project, they were scared for me because I was a single woman. My heart was heavy to leave them but I had to attempt the adventure, see what was outside. I had to live my life. I met a woman who let me stay with her. I had a small sewing machine that my mum bought for me and I did some sewing for a month. Then, I found a job at the French Development Agency as a cleaning lady. My boss was very nice, he covered the cost of French classes. In the language school, I met a Spanish woman but we lost sight of each other. Coincidentally, I bumped into her six months later and when I told her about my issues at work since my former boss left, she said offered me to work with her. I went to Nouadhibou with her and I became a waitress in her guesthouse. One day, I saw a fabric pouch and told her I could make one. She was surprised and asked me why I was working as a cleaning lady or a waitress. I explained to her that it was difficult to open a sewing shop. She gave me some work to do and really liked it, she said You must work in the field of sewing and did everything to encourage me. We opened a sewing shop together in Nouakchott. At the beginning it was difficult, but hamdoulilah, now it goes well. I thank her a lot because she did not know me well but she trusted me. She liked my work and gave me courage. I did everything to succeed, I am ambitious. Now I do what I like and I have more self-confidence. At the beginning, it was not easy to live in Mauritania because people look at you, especially if you are different. People are very curious, if you are taking a walk with a man, they ask if you are married, if he is your boyfriend. This is something that bothers me, and still does. Mindsets and cultures are very different from my country. But in spite of it, I like Mauritania more and more every year. Once a year, I go back to Senegal and it makes me happy, especially to see my mum. I miss the atmosphere in Senegal a lot, talking to people and eating a real thiéboudiène. In a few years, I would like to go back home and open a large sewing shop. I would like to do something in Senegal, in my country, or somewhere else. At the moment, I am in Mauritania but I have other projects in mind. What I want above all is to continue sewing.
156	Awatef and Qusai	Sudan	Egypt	A	A	close	1415	3609	E	im	n	We were displaced by the war in 2004, where I went with my husband to Kelma camp, Sudan. I havent seen my husband since 2008 when the city Um Drman was attacked. I know he escaped, but hes gone. After the attack, I returned to the camp and stayed there for four years. I went to Khartoum and then came here to Cairo in 2012. When I arrived, I found out that I had developed breast cancer. Ive gotten some help from UNHCR, and am still undergoing treatment. I havent been able to work because of the cancer, but my younger sister was working and was able to support me and Qusai, my son. My oldest son, Abdel Razik, came to Egypt after us, in 2014 helped by someone we know. He has taken a few courses with Save the Children and Qusai is now in school. He loves English! We are now going to Texas. I am hoping to get medical treatment, and then get education and a job. I would do any kind of work in order to earn money and support my family. Housecleaning, anything. Qusai wants to go to school and be an engineer and Abudel Razik wants to be a physician. We really want to see the Statue of Liberty and explore America, meet the people and integrate into society. In the beginning, I always believed my country was the best. After the war, we lost our dignity. In Egypt there was stability and freedom, but the economic situation was very harsh. I am really hoping that life in the USA will be far away from war and violence. I would like to tell America that we really hope this refugee resettlement process does not stop, says Abdel Razik.
157	Ayana	Mongolia	Italy	I	E	far	4007	31238	H	im	female	Ayana is a prominent Mongolian opera singer in Italy. She has performed in major theaters of Mongolia and in Italy, interpreting classical works from Rossini to Mozart. She lives near Rome with her husband and daughter. I began studying music when I was six years old. My grandfather, Zandraa Tseveenii, was the very first professional cinematographer and cinema script writer in Mongolia. He was also a writer and an important person in the cultural life of Mongolia. I inherited the passion for art and culture from him. I graduated from University, and little by little, I started singing professionally. But I wanted to develop myself, I wanted to do more. In 2003 I was selected to participate in an international opera contest in Greece. There I met maestro Montarsolo who was the president of the international opera competition. He told me you have a good voice and asked do you want to come to Rome to study? and that was it. On the same day I called my grandparents from Greece and told them Im going to Italy. That was the decision that changed my life. For me, being in a new place with new people was not a shock. My mother was the leading scientist supporting the first space exploration project run by the Science Academy of Mongolia and she constantly travelled, bringing things home from abroad and hosting people from different countries in our house. Still, the first three years in Italy were very difficult for me. Everywhere I went people said wow, youre from Mongolia! I have never seen a Mongolian like you. Some people reacted very badly, and there were some insults. People expect a stereotype. They have an image of the steppe and nomadic people, and I didnt fit the stereotype. At the beginning language was a necessity, and then it became a passion. Language opens many doors, and helps people feel comfortable with you. With language, you can help them understand who you are. I speak Russian, Italian, English and Mongolian. What I add to the opera scene here is that I speak many languages and can be the bridge between worlds. I really wish that people know that Mongolia has many faces. Mongolian people are tranquil, peaceful and tolerant. People are educated and have vision of the world, I am a world citizen. My grandmother was Russian, I was born in Mongolia, and now I live in Italy. My daughter has Italian, Mongolian, Russian and Buryat roots. Mongolia will always be home - I was born there. I miss the Mongolian yougurt, that I could not find here, and the wide spaces. But in Italy I am home because it has given so much to me, I have my family and my daughter here.
158	Ayra	Canada	Germany	N	E	far	43560	45909	E	im	female	My name is Ayra Reyla, I'm 23-years-old and I came to Germany about a year ago in order to study. Originally, I'm from Guelph, Canada, a small town near Toronto. I remember that I was a bit out of my depth with the metro system when I first arrived here. My father was with me and we then decided to take a cab from the airport to get to the hotel. In Guelph, my hometown, there is a totally different vibe compared to here in Berlin. You can strike up a conversation with people more easily. Here in Berlin, people seem to be more introverted. However, I think this is probably not a cultural difference, but is more due to the size of the city. In fact, I see few cultural differences between Germany and Canada. But I immediately felt very welcome in Berlin. Even before, when I visited Berlin as a tourist, I always enjoyed it. It's somehow different from the rest of Germany. People say you can learn everything in Berlin, except German. What I miss most from back home is the routine. Just knowing where everything is. And driving a car, of course! In North America, I learned to drive an automatic. I'm not very good at driving stick, which is why I don't drive here in Berlin. I was born in the Philippines and moved to Canada at the age of three. I can say that the Philippines are my home and that Canada is my home. But in the end, home is not a certain place for me, it's the people I'm surrounded with. Here in Berlin, I have made so many friends and met so many great people that by now, I can also say that Berlin is my home.

With my wife Helen, I left my hometown, Erbil in Iraq, looking for a better job and a higher income. Back home, we were running a small family business, a mini market, but from the moment we stopped being able to afford our little store, we shut it down. Meanwhile, my wife got pregnant and things got more complicated. Our journey to Europe was not easy. We were travelling for months and we arrived in Greece through Turkey. We applied for asylum, but it proved to be a time-consuming procedure for us; my wife was already seven months pregnant. We realized that giving birth away from our hometown and our family was not a wise decision. So, we decided to return to our home, but this time in a safe and organized way. We found out about IOM's voluntary return programmes from a friend. We visited IOM premises in Athens and upon referral we were offered a reintegration counselling session to discuss our options. Since we had experience running a small business, we agreed with IOM's reintegration counselor to restart our new business back home. Thanks to the reintegration programme, we are now able to open a new mini-market and pay part of our rent. Our first expenses will be covered by IOM. I have realized that returning to Iraq wont be a piece of cake. But with IOMs assistance we are looking forward to opening our new small business; we are looking forward to starting our new life and welcoming our baby. Furthermore, my wife who is giving birth in a few weeks, will have the sincere support of our families who are waiting for us back home."
160	Azra	Pakistan	United States	I	N	far	1167	63123	H	im	female	Its a long way from where I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, to the dining room in Vice President Joe Bidens home at the Naval Observatory in Washington,  Yet thats where I found myself one day last December, along with a handful of other cancer specialists. Im convinced that my perspective on medicine as an immigrant is what ultimately got me to the table. Early in my career as an oncologist at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, I treated a woman who was terminally ill with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As her disease progressed, I watched her struggle to write letters for her 2-year-old twin daughters. She wanted them to read a letter from her on each of their birthdays until they turned 21. She died before she got to the ones for their 13th birthday. That experience nearly broke my heart. It also suddenly clarified the purpose of my career. I realized that we needed a more comprehensive understanding of her disease. I needed to learn how pre-leukemia develops into leukemia, how it continues to evolve, and how it can be treated. Had I received my scientific training in the United States, my immediate instinct probably would have been to develop a sophisticated mouse model to work on each of those steps. But because I was educated in Pakistan, I thought about taking a simpler approach — examining the cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), an early-stage version of leukemia. The leader of the group gathered at Vice President Bidens home that day was another immigrant, Dr. Patrick Soon Shiong, a South African-born, Chinese-American surgical oncologist. He developed a way to transplant human islet cells to treat type 1 diabetes, performed the worlds first encapsulated human-to-human and pig-to-human islet transplants, and the first full pancreas transplant on the West Coast. Thanks to this immigrants development of the drug Abraxane, the first FDA-approved chemotherapy agent based on nanotechnology, the lives of thousands of patients with breast, pancreatic, and lung cancers are being prolonged. Many immigrants have brought their unique talents to serve their new country by fighting cancer as healers and researchers. A 2013 study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that 42% of the researchers at the top seven cancer research centers across the country were foreign born. According to a recent study published by George Mason University, immigrants make up 28% of all physicians and surgeons in this country. My parents chose to live in Pakistan but encouraged all seven of their children to immigrate to the United States in search of higher education. We were brought up to believe that it would equip us with the means of contributing to the knowledge of this world. My parents were deeply moved by the welcome their children received in their new homeland, a place where merit was recognized and rewarded regardless of race or color or religion. My older brother is a cardiac surgeon, my older sister trained as a pediatric oncologist, and my younger sister is a radiologist and breast imaging expert. Another sister has a PhD in international relations, a brother is a professor of aerospace engineering, and my youngest brother is an electrical engineer. We are Muslims, we are immigrants, and we are enriching, prolonging, and saving American lives. We are just seven of the many immigrants, from many lands, of many faiths, who are — and have always been — an essential part of Americas strength. We are hard workers, people with big ideas and big dreams, believers in this great country and our shared responsibility to make it even better for all of us.

161	Badreya	Syrian Arab Republic	Lebanon	M	M	close	890	9310	H	im	female	My name is Badreya. I am 26 years old and I come from the town of Ar-Raqqa in northern Syria. The entire area is a hell on earth today and the remaining inhabitants are besieged and trapped - unable to escape to safer parts of the country. I still miss my life and country terribly: the spring breeze, laughter, family lunches…but the Syria I know and love is history now. Im afraid to return and see for myself the devastation my mother-in-law describes. Shes still in Syria and I worry about her. Shes old now and immobile, so she couldnt come to Lebanon with us four and a half years ago, but she insisted that we leave for our childrens sake. I married when I was 17 and we moved to Darayya in Rural Damascus so we could be close to her. My mother-in-law treated me like her own daughter, she spoiled me and took me with her everywhere she went. I was her pride and joy and I felt like a queen. I was so happy. My fondest memories with her are in the kitchen where she taught me to cook dishes like Asheh – a special homemade Syrian sausage made with rice and spiced meat. We usually have Asheh on special occasions like Eid or on Fridays when all of our relatives would come to the house and eat together. Even though she did most of the cooking, she would tell everyone that I cooked it myself and my husband would kiss my hands in front of everyone. It was so easy to laugh in those days. Now, I live in a tent with my husband and our five children in a dismal camp in the Bekaa Valley. I hate it here. Both of our sisters and their families were evicted by their landlords because they couldnt afford to pay rent. They live with us too now. We try to wake up before sunrise and sneak out of the tent, leaving our husbands and kids asleep. The three of us sip coffee and chat. Its the only downtime we get all day. When the sky starts to light up, my sister tells us to close our eyes and listen. The sound of the birds reminds us of Syria. I thank God that were together and safe in Lebanon, but I do pity myself for our misfortune. How can life be so beautiful one day and turn this ugly the next? We have no heating, no running water, I dont have enough money to feed my children and relatives every day, and people in Lebanon are sick of us being here. Life is getting too hard to bear and I feel I have forgotten what happiness feels like.
162	Bala	India	Kuwait	I	M	far	1931	24809	H	im	unisex	I come from Tamil nadu State in India, from a small village close by the sea which consists mostly of agricultural fields where most people work in agriculture jobs that are very low paid. I decided to extend my scope of knowledge by moving to a different state for another career path. Soon after that, my friend informed me of a job opportunity in Kuwait as a security safety officer. When I first arrived in 2012, I was surprised by the extreme hot temperature as I had never witnessed such heat before, I also found many differences in the people their culture and beliefs. Life here was difficult in the beginning as I had to learn how to address people as would be acceptable in the Arab culture. Working as a security safety officer at the United Nations house in Kuwait has given me a lot of confidence as I always have so much support from all staff and colleagues of different hierarchical levels. Work load is high as well as long working hours but I am happily able to manage. I miss my family so much but in Kuwait I feel close to home. Apart from taking financial responsibilites of my family, my dream is to save up to build a house in my native country. This dream is taking longer to accomplish because of sudden unexpected financial burdens and insufficient funds. In the meantime I am enjoying my experience here in Kuwait because the humanitarian field is extremely fulfilling where I relate to those in need from people in need of assistance back in my home village. I feel very lucky and blessed to be a part of the UN family who has always been very friendly and given me lots of love and support. I hope to continue working and progressing in my career here in Kuwait.
163	Baptiste	France	Niger	E	A	far	38959	568	L	im	male	My parents told me I could go study anywhere I wanted so of course I ended up applying for schools in beautiful places such as Greece or Thailand. After I happily announced I had been accepted into a highschool in Cyprus, they were happy to announce that they had chosen Dublin for me so I could improve my English skills. I cried a lot my first month there. It was hard accepting the fact that I was not living in my home country anymore, especially that at that time my English was really not great. As a foreigner, you dont know where you stand in society – if youre part of it or youre just a long term tourist. By the end of my stay, I was sad to leave because I was starting to feel like a Dubliner. I was part of the local basketball team, and had even started talking with an Irish accent. It was about then that I started feeling more international than French. When I went back to france, I started studying Arabic and Serbian, but gave up after 8 months. I thought that way I could feel international while still being in France, but I quickly realized that learning a foreign language is not the same thing as living abroad. After graduating in history, I was told I could either be a teacher or a researcher, and I didnt want to be either so I sent out 144 applications to international organizations until I finally understood that nobody was reading them. I eventually found somebodys contact in Kosovo and begged them to hire me as an intern. So when they replied asking if I could be in Kosovo in a weeks time, I happily said yes. After three days in Kosovo, not having met or talked to anyone, I already knew I was home. After working in Laos, Tunisia and Burkina Faso, I moved to Niger where Ive been residing for the past year and where I had to learn the true meaning of patience. Sometimes you get frustrated with the electricity, but sometimes you sail along the Niger river in a pirogue while looking at hippos. Its a boiling country because of the weather, but also because its moving all the time, from migrants to politics. Nigeriens are very warm and welcoming, but it wasnt that easy in the beginning to get into their close circle of friends whereas in Kosovo, people are cold in the beginning, but once you have gained their trust, you are friends for life. Even now, six years later, if you ask me where I would spend the rest of my life, Id say Kosovo.
164	Barbara	Italy	Switzerland	E	E	close	31238	86919	E	im	female	Through my work in human rights protection and crime prevention, I do my best to be an ally to those who are disenfranchised. Often this work extends to migrants, who are adjusting to life away from home under circumstances that do not always privilege their rights. I strive to protect those rights, volunteering as a legal guardian for unaccompanied minors. I have also co-founded integration projects in my community of origin for migrant and disadvantaged Italian youth. In Geneva, where I now live, I support the Cuisine Lab project: a non-profit organisation that brings locals and migrants together for cultural exchanges around food, art, culture and more. Organizing food and storytelling events for adults and children is an excellent way to get locals and newcomers to interact. The people I have met through all these initiatives, as well as my own experiences, have taught me how migration can mean freedom, opportunity, risk but also personal growth for those who pursue it. I love my country but I felt I had to look for work and life elsewhere when I was younger, and that search has never ended for me. I keep migrating and I appreciate having the opportunity to do so. To those about to set off on a big journey I would say: be curious, ask as many questions as you need to, especially if something is strange to you. If you don't understand the answer, keep asking!
165	Barbara	Serbia	Ireland	E	E	close	7656	86251	H	im	female	I was born in Ireland to an Irish mother and a Serbian father, but I grew up in Serbia. I left Serbia and moved to Ireland when I was 30. The thing is I used to come here on holidays and I thought there was an interesting difference between going on holidays and visiting my family, and living here. When I was in my teens and if I brought up my half Irishness people would say ahh ahh, well youre Irish then and when I moved to live here it didnt really work, it was more like oh your half Irish, thats interesting. It was more my foreignness that was noticed. In the beginning I only moved for the summer and I was thinking will I stay, wont I stay, so it was a very gradual process, but it also coincided with me taking up real work. I was at working age but there wasnt really much work going on at the time in Serbia and I was living with my parents. I had a kind of dependence on them so when I came to Ireland I became independent. I mainly missed my family and friends. I would say that was a big thing for me. In those days in my bedsit I didnt have the internet, so there were no emails, or viber and there was a big gap in communications. I have two points of origin and I think thats always an enriching thing. But even if you dont have two points of origin, when you migrate you lose yourself into another culture and you adapt. I can see it in myself, when I moved here I was going well Im half Irish but I realized by the way that people reacted to me that I am actually more Serbian, because thats where I grew up and I have more Serbian cultural traits. Moving abroad gives you the opportunity to learn good parts of other cultures.
166	Barbara and Chaqir	Morocco	Italy	A	E	far	3108	31238	H	im	n	"Chaqir: I am from Rabat, Morocco. I was 11 years old when my parents decided to divorce. At the divorce tribunal, the judge gave custody of myself and my big brother to my father, who would not allow my mother to see us anymore. As a divorced woman of a military general, she had trouble finding a new job and decided to join my aunt that was working in Italy. My brother, who was sixteen at the time, had a fight with my father. He believed that it was all his fault our mother had not visited. So, we decided to follow my mother in Italy, although we didnt really understand what we were doing or how to get there. We were lucky enough to meet an Italian truck driver on the way, who noticed that my brother was wearing an original Naples soccer team jersey signed by Maradona, a present from our father. We traded the jersey to get on his truck across the border. He had his shirt and we were in Europe. At first, my mother was veryupset about our decision to run away but eventually all that settled down. Sometimes I cannot believe that I would have never got the chance to meet Barbara, my girlfriend, had I not left Morocco. In many ways, she had a very similar experience to my own and this makes us closer. My hope for the world is that different people with different experiences can move around and meet one another. No matter where you come from, everyone should be allowed to be with the person they love if that is what they want. Barbara: My parents decided to leave Albania because there was a citizens rebellion that broke out. Life became very difficult to bear, so they fled and found the first ship to Italy.  It was about one year before I was born. My family lived in an abandoned hostel, together with migrants of all kinds of nationalities, for the next fifteen years. As a kid, I did not think that it was strange. I did not feel uncomfortable or uneasy; it felt like a big family and I liked it. But then when I went to school, I started to realize that my classmates had really different living conditions. I began to feel shy, like there was something missing from my life. When I started dating in high school, I noticed that guys wouldnt call me back when they knew I had Albanian origins, so I would tell them I was from Greece or was half Italian. Things have gotten better with time. People tolerate mixed couples now, while a few years ago it was not accepted at all. One time, while I was having a drink with a friend, Chaqir approached me speaking in English. We continued to chat in English but I had a feeling that he was from Italy! He thought I was a foreigner, and when I told him I was actually born in Italy he apologized in Italian and we started laughing. Soon after, we became friends and started dating. Being different is not something bad. It adds to the lives of people that you meet."
167	Barbara-Anne	Canada	United Kingdom	N	E	far	43560	40718	E	im	female	"I was born in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. Our family moved to the UK in 2008 when my husband was offered a job in the chemistry department at Durham University. I applied for and was offered a job at the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University where I worked on a DEFRA-funded project examining neurological components of animal welfare in broiler breeder chickens; the aim of this work was to ensure the food supply is sustainable. I have since moved to Durham University to join the psychology department as both International Tutor and a PhD student. As International Tutor, I guide, support, and assist international students adjust to life in the UK and to their program. My research focuses on the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for learning and memory. This part of the brain is particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of aging and disease, including Alzheimer's. By understanding how our experiences are represented, stored, and lost in the brain, perhaps we will be able to better understand disease. I am proud to contribute to the British Neuroscience community. Our family is committed to contributing to our community. In partnership with our local church, we have set up and run a series of soup lunches in support of the local food bank. We have also run a series of free community film nights to encourage residents of Durham to enjoy time out together. We arrange these events so that local children host the event, introduce the film, and hand out cups of sweets and crisps. I am a tutor at St. Chad's College, Durham University. I find this role particular rewarding because it gives me the opportunity to mentor students at a critical stage in their lives. Encouraging these students to be Global Citizens, to study languages, to embrace social justice and change is a role that I am honoured to hold. I hope that I can serve as a role model to them. I am an immigrant, and the college entrusted me with this important role. My son attends a local school, plays violin in the music club, is a member of a cathedral choir 'Minstrels', takes swimming lessons at the local baths, and has recently taken an interest in judo. We buy our groceries from a local farm shop, New Close Farm. We are very lucky to have such wonderful local products freely available. We make every opportunity to support the local economy. We are National Trust members and take great joy in walking our dog, Penny, through the many gorgeous landscapes the UK offers. For the last several years we have only taken holidays within the UK. Not only to contribute to local economies, but also to experience and truly get to know better this wonderful country we now call home."
168	Barry	Guinea	Niger	A	A	close	1179	568	E	im	male	"First time I took the boat from Tripoli to go to Italy, we were 120 on the boat. They caught us after 10 minutes and turned our boat around. We managed to escape as they were shooting at us. I got back to the place I was living and decided to try again. They caught us after two hours the second time around. They took away our engine and left us there. There was a hole in the boat so once the water started mixing with the gas, it started burning our skin. I was crying as I was looking around at people jumping from the boat, at people dying, and I couldnt do anything to help them. We were 168 when we left and 8 made it back alive. I was watching my death unfold before my eyes. The waves were pushing the boat in every direction. I didnt see anyone or even a bird for days. I had given up hope completely. I dont even know how to swim. I had been floating around with no food or water for two days when a couple of fishermen pulled me out unconscious. Some people came to our house and set it on fire and yet I managed to escape again as I feared prison in Libya. God gave me another chance at life. People leave their countries to look for money, but when you die, you wont take anything with you; it will all stay behind. Life is not eternal. I have lived and seen a lot on this route, but I know others who have had it much worse in Libya. As a black person in Libya, you will have a miserable life. You eat like an ant, sleep like a duck and work as a slave. You live in fear that someone might kill you at any time of day or night. Its hell on earth, and once youre there, it wont be easy to get out. Back home, we dont have to put up with such a miserable life and racial segregation. I tried three times to go back because many of my friends had made it to Europe so I was determined to be one of them. But I also know many that have died in the desert or in Libya, and others that have gone back home. I forgot that not everyone has the same luck in life and that we cant avoid whats written for us. Some people only try it once and they die at sea; Ive tried it three times and Im still alive. Maybe I will one day make it to Europe by a legal way. In the meantime, I hold my head up high as I go back because I havent killed anyone or stolen anything. I dont see it as failure, but as a stepping stone in my life. This experience has taught me that I deserve more."
169	Belkis	Afghanistan	Bulgaria	I	E	far	508	10058	H	im	female	Belkis arrived in Bulgaria in 1985 as a teacher and supervisor of a group of twenty orphaned children that she still calls my children. Nowadays, she works as a volunteer translator and mediator for the Bulgarian Red Cross and IOM, and helps refugees and migrants any way she can. Around the time when I left Afghanistan, security in the country had already begun to deteriorate. Due to the worsening situation, the children I worked with - sixteen boys and four girls between the ages of seven and nine, were sent to Bulgaria under a governmental programme to continue their studies there and I went with them as their supervisor. They were very nice, studied hard and all of them found their way in Bulgaria. Now all of them have careers, houses, and cars, are married and have their own children. I have never regretted my decision to come here with them. After my children graduated, I was not able to go back to my home country anymore because of the civil war there. I started working as a volunteer for the Bulgarian Red Cross and I still help different NGOs as a volunteer. For foreigners the integration process is very important. They need to learn about and understand the culture and the language. I am happy to assist them in that process. For me, Bulgaria feels like home already. I feel good here because I know the people, we interact the same way, and I greet and talk to my neighbours every day. Your home is not only the earth, water and sky around it, but also your family, friends, ideas and morals.
170	Bella	Nigeria	Niger	A	A	close	2085	568	E	im	female	"Ismael has been working as an IOM database agent and community mobilizer (or MobCom) for the past three years. When he is not doing admin work at the office, Ismael is out in the field — in bus stations and ghettos — raising awareness about irregular migration and its alternatives. Most recently, he has been raising awareness about COVID-19. In the beginning, the neighbors were talking; there were rumors Ismael was a brothel enthusiast, he joked. My family sat me down and I had to thoroughly explain to them my work. I think — I hope — they understood. Due to COVID-19, and the closure of construction sites in Algeria at the beginning of the pandemic, more West African migrants started to come back to Niger. But with public transport suspended, most couldnt travel further south of Arlit, nor move further north. An opportunity was soon spotted by local residents with their own vehicles. They reinvented themselves as transporters. Landlords also converted to ghetto owners. The travel restrictions have favored, among other things, the emergence of these new ghettos, but also the resurrection of older ones. Higher prices were posted and new challenges had to be overcome by migrants who, already low on money, had to pay double the prior price for transport and accommodation. In 2017, just as Ismael was starting his journey with IOM, Bella was starting her journey from Nigeria to Europe. Ever since her parents died, as the eldest in her family, Bella has had to carry the financial load to support her three sisters, their children and two of her own. Just 26 years old, she had big dreams of making enough money in Italy to support her family back home. Traveling alone on her way up through Niger, she stopped in Arlit, close to the border with Algeria, where she met fellow Nigerians. They all recounted horrendous stories of abuse, of unimaginable things they had experienced in prison in Libya or trying to cross to Italy by boat. This was enough to change Bellas mind. She decided to go back, but she was embarrassed. She couldnt return home and show up empty-handed. Through common friends, she met Madame Pandora, a 40-year-old Nigerian woman. For the past ten years Madame Pandora has been running a popular brothel in Arlit. Pandora herself had tried crossing from Libya to Europe in 2008 but was returned to shore. After two failed attempts, Pandora also decided to go back to Niger and settle in Arlit where she got married and had a child. I thought that if I tried again, I would die, she recalled. I just made up my mind that I wasnt destined to be there. Bella didnt feel at ease with the idea of working in a brothel, but she accepted, reluctantly, hoping she could soon make enough money to return to Nigeria. It now has been three years. Pandora is currently hosting 20 Nigerian women ranging from 24 to 60 years old in her maison close, one of the estimated 60 brothels in Arlit and four in the infamous cartier de lenfer (neighborhood of hell). Unlike Agadez, Arlit tends to host more female migrants in brothels rather than in ghettos, due to the high number of migrant women headed for Algeria in search of work opportunities. Pandora herself was forced to increase the girls daily rent much to their despair. Bella hasnt seen her children, aged six and ten, since she left, but she always made sure they had everything they needed. I used to send my family money every month, Bella says amidst tears. I dont remember the last time I sent them money. I can barely feed myself these days. Due to travel restrictions, IOMs Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) programme had to be suspended as well. At full capacity, the transit centers increasingly became unable to accept new migrants wishing to go home. Fortunately, by early June, IOMs AVRR programme had resumed, thanks to a humanitarian corridor organized by IOM with support from the Government of Niger. At first glance, COVID-19 prevention measures seem unlikely to be followed in Pandoras maison close, now equipped with a brand-new handwashing station received from a local NGO but never refilled due to the lack of running water. As for the clients — patience seems to be lacking. We tell them to wash their hands and they tell us to get on with it already; the clock is ticking, the women say. But COVID-19 seems hardly a concern for the women for whom money remains the main struggle. It was never this bad. With COVID-19, we cant do business like before, says Pandora, who also runs a hair salon next door which hardly sees any clients these days. Luckily, I can get by thanks to my small side businesses. Due to the many gold mines close to Arlit and its surroundings, the town hosts high numbers of gold miners from mostly Chad and Sudan who, as regular brothel clients, often pay the women in gold nuggets called ficha. Neatly stacked in paracetamol bottles, the nuggets are weighed directly at the brothel on portable scales and later exchanged at one of the many nearby pawn shops in Arlit. Nevertheless, fewer people visit them these days and those who do, tend to be poor themselves. They come in with phones, clothes, shoes or food, expecting services in exchange. What choice do we have? No one will give us any other job in this town, Bella says. The women have experienced their fair share of violence during their stay at the maison close, where the only things that can offer them protection seem to be some rusty locks and a few dogs. Not a day goes by that the street boys dont harass us — and at the end they rob us and leave. Without hope of protection, the women say most have stopped reporting these incidents. After a short COVID-19 related break, Ismael and his team of MobComs picked up their awareness-raising activities again, visiting ghettos and talking to migrants about their struggles and alternatives. Most of the girls they met in Arlit have long given up on their dream of reaching Europe, albeit knowing a select few who have succeeded in reaching their destination. They video-call us with an Italian number; they show us where they are. Its luck; they are destined to be there — not everyone is, Pandora says with a pragmatic tone. There are also countless girls who left for Libya and I havent heard from them since. I dont even know if they are still alive. Bella is glancing at the leaflet on IOMs assistance and confesses she wants to go home. Some of the girls went back home with IOMs help and you should too if you feel prepared, Pandora tells her. But myself, I dont feel ready now. I know deep down that I need to go back one day, but not today. Ask me again next week. IOMs awareness-raising activities in Niger are currently carried out in the framework of IOMs Migrant Resource and Response Mechanism, under the project Migrants Rescue and Assistance in Agadez Region (MIRAA) Phase III, supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands."
171	Benjamin	United States	Canada	N	N	close	63123	43560	E	im	male	Going to Canada as a US-American was almost unpredictable – its so similar, not many Americans come here. I guess a lot of US-Americans dont think about Canada that much. Yet it is still different, the political system for example. What is considered conservative here, would still be liberal in the United States. When I was in my early twenties I enjoyed moving around a lot, but now Ive been living here for more than four years. Thats the longest time I've spent in one place since I left high school. Ive settled here and married a Canadian, so I will apply for residence. I can be happy in both countries, but I still feel like an American. I dont feel foreign, maybe only when people speak about politics and history as they are different for both countries. I think the perception of people is interesting: If you stand out, youre a migrant, if not, you can do whatever you want. My parents were immigrants to the United States. They went there from the former Soviet Union just two months before I was born. So to me home is where my life is. Building a home is something you do, you actively pursue that. I grew up a little differently, we spoke two languages at home, ate different foods. And some of the cultural differences within American society I experienced, rather than having them explained by my parents – because they didnt know themselves. Being a migrant just means youre not terribly tied to a place. For me its important to stay in touch with certain people, wherever I am in the world.
172	Beqir	Albania	Albania	E	E	close	5181	5181	E	hc	male	Beqir lives with his parents and his older sister in the vicinity of Cerrik. Cerrik is a small built town that developed in communist Albanias 60s around an oil refinery plant, which today lies abandoned at the entrance of the town. The nearest biggest urban centre is Elbasan, only 15 km away, but it takes almost one hour by car to reach it because of the road conditions. Beqir attends his last year of high school. He should have been graduated but he skipped a year when he was 17 to spend several months in Molfetta, a small town close to Bari, Italy. Beqir doesnt have great memories of Molfetta and the period he spent in Italy. He was hosted in a community centre for unaccompanied minors at which he could only go out with his peers a few hours a day. At home in Albania, his father takes care of the familys small farm. They also have a greenhouse full of lettuce and spinach built by Beqir and his father with the support of IOM office in Tirana. In the mornings, Beqirs mother goes to the downtown market to sell fresh vegetables. Through the reintegration grant, Beqirs family bought the materials to build the greenhouse and the seeds for the first sowing. The greenhouse gives the family a steady monthly income. IOMs support helped me to feel more useful at home and more participative to my community.
173	Bernardo	Argentina	Germany	L	E	far	8476	45909	H	im	male	I was born in Germany. My mother comes from Argentina and my father is German. When I was eight years old, my parents decided to return to Argentina where I culturally grew up. When I turned 25, I left for Dublin to take up a management position in a hotel where I ended up staying for 10 years. Three years ago, I decided to come back to Germany. I enjoyed going to Argentina when I was 8. It was always warm, people were much more open. It was simply exciting. After my studies, I started to work in the management of luxury hotels. I knew I would have to travel a lot. Anyway, the crisis in Argentina in 2001 helped me take a decision. First, I went to the United States where I stayed for 8 months. Then I spent a year traveling through Europe and I stopped over in Dublin which seemed to me the most interesting city: very lively, young and professionally rich. Dublin is socially and culturally the perfect intermediate between Argentina and Germany: it is not as disorganized as South America but still not as disciplined as it is in Germany. And in terms of people, Dublin is just great. Everyone wants to know who you are and not necessarily what you do. Here in Germany people want to classify others according to their education and positions. After Argentina and Ireland, it was a shock to be back here, in my homeland somehow. I feel sometimes that people here are petite bourgeoisie, not always tolerant, nor open and not so patient. I dont know yet if I'll stay here. Everything will depend on work opportunities and I dont know where Ill end up. My girlfriend is Polish. If my employer sends me somewhere else again, we will probably leave. I would not like go back to Argentina nor Ireland, which are closed chapters for me now. I would like to move to a completely new place. Discover new places, new people.
174	Betty	Papua New Guinea	Papua New Guinea	I	I	close	2640	2640	E	hc	female	I WILL BE SO HAPPY TO GET HOME. I WILL BE ABLE TO REBUILD MY HOUSE AND LOOK AFTER MY FAMILY PROPERLY. RIGHT NOW ITS DANGEROUS – OUR ENEMIES ARE WATCHING US - BUT WE HOPE THE PEACE PROCESS WILL BE CONCLUDED SOON AND WELL GO BACK TO OUR LANDS AND OUR GARDENS. Betty Barnabas (51), teacher, mother of four, has been displaced by violent conflict, and cant go home until the peace process is concluded. She has been living with relatives for five years, patiently waiting her turn to use the kitchen, wash the kids, get ready for work. Day after day, for the last five years. From her words, she could be South Sudanese, Rohingya, Somali, Syrian, Afghan or from any one of a number of other conflict-affected groups and nations. She could be hundreds of miles from home. But she isnt. Shes right next door. She last saw her house on the 29th of November 2009. Our chief rang the alarm bell at 5 am and I woke up to gunshots and shouting. I didnt have time to grab my mobile or my wallet. We just ran to the beach and ran towards where our cousins lived. My seven-year-old daughter ran naked. The village was burned to the ground, and Bettys neighbours slaughtered in a horrible manner, cut in two and buried headfirst. Reprisals followed, and the area became too unsafe to return to. Betty and her friends opened a temporary school, and put their lives on hold for five years. The tribal chiefs have recently met, and hostilities have recently come to a close. Incredibly, Betty now lives just 600 metres from her old home, in a coastal community called Labu Tale, on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. Her sentiments, her painful longing for her own land, her own home and hearth is as deep and poignant as found among refugees and displaced people the world over. The conflict is between two tribes – one from the mountains and the other from the coast – and it erupted after the mountain-dwellers were found digging on land near the coast. A generations-old agreement had allowed the mountain people to cross the coastal land to access the sea, but not to dig or build. Papua New Guinea is riven by similar tribal conflicts, which IOM and others are attempting to map to find out how many people may be displaced, like Betty, across this large and underdeveloped country. Most of the conflicts involve only a few hundred people, but they can be extremely violent and last for years. Hostilities flare up over issues that might appear petty to the outside world, and they add to the day-to-day dangers faced by isolated coastal and mountain communities in this nation of 8 million people.
175	Binta	Liberia	Niger	A	A	close	491	568	E	im	female	I was pregnant when I started this journey and as the months went on, traveling became harder and harder for me. We were 40 people from all over the region crammed in one car. We had nowhere to sleep. The sun made us go crazy. There was no food or water in the desert. We had nothing. And I was pregnant. Ive been traveling for work for the past five years to Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Senegal. Ive usually worked as a hairdresser. During my time in Senegal I met the father of my one-month-old baby girl. For the past two years, I had been living in Libya where I owned a small clothes shop. I had heard from a friend on Facebook that you could earn decent money in Europe so I decided to sell my boutique. I had then USD 1,800 in cash to attempt the crossing. Someone put me in contact with a smuggler that promised he would take me and my boyfriend all the way to Italy or Spain. I gave him all the money I had and at some point during the trip he asked for more. Thats when I realized that he had lied. That we would never go to Europe. I felt completely discouraged. I didnt have the energy to fight to get to Italy, and to be one of those people on the boats. As we were going back, Boko Haram apprehended us. They took the money we had left and things, and shoved us all in the same car. We eventually made it to Agadez and from there to Niamey. With the assisted voluntary return and reintegration programme, I hope I can open the same kind of boutique that I had before. One Sunday at church in Niamey, I started having terrible stomach pains, and felt my blood pressure rising and my head spinning. I was immediately rushed to the hospital and had to get an emergency C-section. The baby was very weak and tiny in the beginning, but we both managed to pull through. Im very happy to see her healthy. And Im thankful I am healthy as well because I really thought I was going to die at some point. As grateful as I am for all the assistance I have received, I am excited about going back home. All I am waiting for is the doctors approval that the baby is strong enough to travel. I hope that once back, I can also find the son I have left behind three years ago. I honestly regret taking on this journey to Europe. I want to stay in Liberia. Theres no place like home.

Two weeks later, I lost my three-year-old son as well. He was very sick and I couldnt properly take care of him. I have three other kids to take care of now. I feel hopeless at times, but I dont want to have to use my body to feed them. I need to stay strong and fight. A friend in Libya called me to offer me a job so I sold everything I had, including my shop, so I could make it to Libya. I only made it to Dirkou where the driver abandoned us. We were there for five days without any food or water. I didnt know what to do. He left with all of our things, and we kept hoping he was going to come back; he never did. After my son and husband died, I got an ulcer. After the fifth day in the desert, I started vomiting blood. I was lying down for the whole time hoping for a miracle. I was thinking about my children; how I needed to stay strong for them. A Nigerian boy who worked in Dirkou saw me and advised me to go to IOM. He pulled over a moto, but there was no room for me. He told the driver to come back to get us, and he did. They rushed me to IOMs centre in Dirkou, and then to the hospital where they gave me treatment for my ulcer. I could barely walk by the time we reached the centre. Im so grateful Im still alive. I sometimes wonder what would have happened to me if I hadnt met the Nigerian boy. A lot of people stayed in the desert. They didnt want any help as they still had money left. They were trying to reach Libya, and even after five days straight in the desert, they were still convinced the driver was going to come back. They are probably still there. I told them I was going back to my home country. There are some things that money cant buy."

The borders dont seem real to someone like me in this part of the world. Many families are as regionally diverse as mine. I feel very connected to everything thats going on in the region. The language is almost the same. I see all the war and difficulties we face and take it to heart, especially whats going on in Syria. I still have family there, and some of them have died. My uncle died as an aid worker in Damascus. I havent been back since 2011. I grew up in Damascus but migrated to Jordan when I was a teenager. I live in a part of Amman where there are lots of migrants from all over the world, just like me. Theres a good arts scene, nice cafes, and good opportunities to ask people about where theyre from. I was inspired by these conversations. I went to school to become an industrial engineer but decided to take a break in my education to become a flight attendant. My mother is very encouraging. She says I should see as much of the world as I can while I am still young. I do about fifteen flights per month and have been able to visit many places. My favorite cities to visit are in Europe – I especially love Vienna and Berlin. I feel like I want to keep going and explore the world while I still can. Being a flight attendant is a great way to see the world and save money, but I still want to become an engineer. I hope when I have saved enough money, I can resume my education in Vienna.

When he left the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he was determined and full of hope. I heard so many stories about Europe, friends who made it and now have a decent life that I wanted a new life in El Dorado too. So I left my country. I knew the journey would not be easy but I was ready to handle it no matter what. In 2011, I went to Mauritania on a regular visa hoping to make it to Europe ultimately. It is then that my new life started to take shape. I had the chance to meet a local painter and I finally discovered my talent and myself. In 2013, after a first successful exhibition, Bitongo decided to try to immigrate to Morocco. I bought a flight ticket to Casablanca, without any visa. As soon as I landed, I was sent back to Mauritania. After five failed attempts, tired of all the negativity and lies, I decided to start a new life in Mauritania. As I was talented, my friend welcomed me again in his atelier and helped me find a job as an art teacher in a local school. In Africa, there are many young people who have talent, but we live in countries where there is no possibility to develop a dream, an idea. So we are forced to migrate to developed countries to have a chance to become successful. I was so obsessed with going to Europe that I was wasting my youth and my creativity for nothing. With all I went through, I realized that my talent would take me everywhere. Young people! Don't risk your life trying to reach Europe irregularly. Build up your life through your talent.

He is the lead singer in a reggae band and recently started the first Afro Bar in the country where he cooks traditional Ethiopian meals and invites different kind of bands to come and play music. I came here as a student and after finishing university I decided to stay here and now I have a very handsome son who is already 18 years old. I have a lot of very nice friends and I play in a great reggae band. I recently opened an Afro bar where I gather people who are engaged in various activities and want to inspire each other. When I was a student in Ethiopia I joined a program that provided scholarship opportunities for studying abroad. I got three options: Germany, Hungary or Bulgaria. I did not know much about Bulgaria, but in high school we read a translated book about this city in Bulgaria named Gabrovo (known for its annual humor festival) and ever since I have been curious. Now that I have been here for so long, there are some things that I miss about Ethiopia. For example, our family home, my school and the people I grew up with. But since Ive lived most of my life in Bulgaria, Ive started feeling more at home here. I got used to the people, I have friends. One big difference continues to be the seasons. I used to live 2000 meters above the sea-level with only sunshine. I experienced minus 15 degrees Celsius during my first winter in Bulgaria and I saw two meters high driven snow. In Ethiopia you can only see this in the movies. In 2010 I met a few people in the neighbour I live in. We all play different instruments and started to play music together. Our band is called the Rebelites. We play very often at the Afro Bar. The Ethiopian New Year is celebrated September 11th. We will have a big party here that will probably go on for at least two days. You are all invited!
180	Bombino	Niger	Niger	A	A	close	568	568	E	hc	male	The first time I saw a video of a Jimi Hendrix concert I was in Tripoli, Libya. I was searching for a job there, which I hadnt found, yet I found the cassette of Jimi Hendrix. It was even better. Omara Bombino Moctar is an internationally acclaimed Tuareg rock guitarist and singer from Agadez, Niger. Often described as the Jimi Hendrix of the Desert, Bombino spent most of his childhood as a refugee in Libya and Algeria after fleeing the Third Tuareg Rebellion in 1990. Playing guitar was everything for me. I was just searching for something that would bring me closer to it. Watching Jimi Hendrix was a confirmation of the path I had to follow, says Bombino. After several years of displacement, Bombino returned to Niger mastering the guitar with the ambition to make a living from it. I brought back several cassettes from Libya and Algeria when I returned. I would watch them over and over again. Although Bombino describes himself as being part of a nomadic community, displacement was frightening. I was a child. I was afraid. I didnt know what would happen. Luckily, because I am a Tuareg, it was easy to find several relatives in Libya and Algeria. It was an opportunity to be with them. The Tuareg are a nomadic community widespread across several countries comprised of Niger, Mali, Algeria, Libya, and Burkina Faso. Today, Bombino views his guitar as a weapon for peace and tolerance. People used to view Tuareg as trouble makers, now people have forgotten that image thanks to music like mine. People no longer look at me and where I am coming from, they simply listen to the music and enjoy it. I do believe that it has contributed to the stability of my country.
181	Bosai	Myanmar	Thailand	I	I	close	1292	7189	H	im	male	I am Bosai, I am from Myanmar. I came here because my father passed away and we had a lot of family. At that time there was also a lot of fighting so we fled. The journey was difficult. There were a lot of mountains. We arrived here by foot. It took us five days. I came here with my entire family. That was in 2005. Bosai is now a 30 year old refugee from Myanmar currently residing in a temporary shelter area along the Thai-Myanmar border. Officially known as the Tham Hin Temporary Shelter area, it is home to over 7000 refugees of mainly Karen origin like him. Bosai and his family arrived in Tham Hin after a long and difficult five day trek through mountain terrain as they fled civil war. That was in 2005. Ten years later, he is married with two kids, speaks three languages and contributes to the community as an IOM security staff: I was also able to receive an education here. When I was in Myanmar, I was not able to have one. My parents did not have enough money to pay for it because we are a big family of seven children. I went to school after coming here. It was at school where I learnt business English. I picked it up step by step and been learning it for 10 years now. Despite the challenges faced, Bosai views his life in the shelter area with positivity. He is happy to be able to live his life in peace and is satisfied with the opportunities he has received thus far. Coming from a poor family with seven children, his parents were not able to afford sending him to school in Myanmar. Tham Hin however provided an opportunity for him to receive an education where he started from scratch at the age of 20. He picked up English and is one of a few that is able to speak it at a respectable level. He is also well versed in Thai and occasionally assists with translations between the three languages. As a security staff with IOM, some of his duties include looking after the IOM building and accompanying refugees to the provincial hospital from time to time. He has been doing this for the past four years and enjoys the job as it is not physically strenuous. He is also currently taking a first aid course during his spare time: I just want my whole family to be happy. I would like to study medicine. I am taking a medical course right now and enjoy studying it. I actually have a presentation and exam coming up soon so I will study and prepare for that for now. I would like to become a doctor. Despite being an unregistered refugee, Bosai has high hopes for the future. He is determined to wait for an opportunity to be resettled to a third country, preferably the United States where his twin brother currently resides.
182	Bounthanh	Lao People's Democratic Republic	United States	I	N	far	2623	63123	H	im	female	I remember the sound, the smell and running to safety, from when I was only a toddler. We were living in the war zone and I was constantly afraid of bombings and gunshots. I grew up with a feeling of insecurity, not knowing when the next bomb would fall. When our province in Laos was taken by the communists in 1969, we fled to another city and became refugees in our own country. Eventually by mid 1970s when the whole region was under communist rule and the United States troops had left, many started fleeing the country. First, we had to make it into a refugee camp and out of harms way. My family took a canoe and crossed a large river to Thailand. Many were not so lucky and died while attempting to make the crossing. Once in Thailand, we applied for asylum in Australia, France and the United States. Bounthanhs family, which by then included their two toddler sons, was resettled in Columbus, Ohio in late 1979, sponsored by the Trinity Lutheran Church. With a yen for helping others and eager to make the most of the opportunity at a new life, they set up the Laotian Mutual Assistance Association. Through this organization, they have helped hundreds of families transition from refugee camps in Asia to their new lives in the American Midwest. Through my regular job, as a social worker, which was to help refugees resettle in Columbus and our volunteer work with the Laotian Mutual Assistance Association, were able to help many families find their way and succeed here. We like to work with people. When we worked with refugees on a volunteer basis we realized that a large portion of the needs they had were related to health, wellness, language and cultural barriers. That is when we opened Diversified Health Management in 2004, a home care agency. Together with her husband and two sons, Bounthanh has been serving the community for a number of years, growing the family business in home healthcare and job placement, established by one of her sons. Everyone that comes to our door gets the help they need. We like to be able to connect people and services, always looking at whats best for that particular individual and their family.
183	Boutros	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	male	Boutros decided to leave Syria three years ago, when his hand and arm were shot inside his own house. He still doesnt know if the shots came from the Free Army, or from Assads forces. His family begged him to leave, so he had to pay traffickers 2,000 USD to reach the Turkish border from his village in southern Damascus. In Turkey he worked for almost 2 years to save enough to continue the journey. Then, he paid 1/3 of the regular price to traffickers to cross the Mediterranean, because he would be the one driving the boat. He had never driven a boat before. It was late at night and they told me, Do you see those lights there? Thats a Greek land, thats where you have to go. They arrived 4 hours later in Lesbos, Greece, and when he continued his journey he was arrested in Macedonia, Serbia and Croatia. In Macedonia Boutros, who is a Christian, spent a month in jail, but went free after paying a 200 USD bribe. The whole trip here cost me about 5,000 USD and with that money I could have bought a house, a car and get married in Syria. His phone was one of the most precious things he carried on his journey. Sometimes Europeans see that we have good phones and ask, Why does a refugee has a phone? These phones are like our visas. If we lose our phones, we lose our lives. Boutros has used his phone not only for communication, but also as a map. When the battery died in FYROM (Republic of Macedonia), just before the border with Serbia, he was lost for two days in the mountains without food or water until a shepherd helped him find the way. His mother and his 10 year old brother are still in Syria. Syria is now the land of the 3rd global war, and people only stay there because of three reasons. Either they do not have enough money to pay smugglers, they have a relatives fighting in one of the armies, or they are too old. Two of his uncles are combatants, one for Assads army and the other for the Free Army. I like Berlin because it is like Damascus was in the past, with lots of people on the streets, lots of restaurants, and universities. When people ask me why I left Syria, I just want to forget everything. So I just tell them that I like Berlin, that want I to live here, and I ask them whats the problem with that?
184	Bradley	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	male	I am a cultural geographer and chair of geography ethics in the economy, governance & culture research group at the University of Southampton. My work has been featured in media around the world and I have written for The Guardian, Times Literary Supplement, Financial Times, Times Higher Education. My first book, Explore Everything: Place Hacking the City was published by Verso Book in the Autumn 2013. In 2015, I was nominated for the Southampton Student Union Excellence in Teaching Award. I have also been under constant threat from the Home Office of deportation because of the political nature of my research. I have been trapped in the UK for the majority of the past three years under various threats of 'soft' or 'hard' deportation. I currently await a work visa which has been with the Home Office since October 2014.
185	Camilla	Italy	Belgium	E	E	close	31238	45028	E	im	female	I come from Italy, and I left my country when I was 16 years old to go to the United States so I have always considered myself a migrant. For any who chooses to migrate, learning a new language can be the hardest part of the journey. I was lucky because the language aspect was not too much of a challenge, and after I learned the rules in my new home, things were easy for me. I currently live in Belgium, so I am still away from my native Italy. There are differences in the way people interact with each other compared to the way things are done in Italy. I do of course miss the food, the culture and my friends – Italy will always be special to me. But Brussels is home now and I am happy to be abroad, learning about other cultures, while taking on new experiences and challenges. My advice to those who choose to migrate is to learn the language of your destination country first, and then be patient while you adjust to your new space. There are challenges along the way, and for some people this means facing racism, which is one of the worst. Racism comes through the generations and often boils down to a lack of education. By helping others to integrate, we can work to fight against it.
186	Camille	Trinidad and Tobago	United States	L	N	far	15286	63123	E	im	female	My story is no different to that of the typical immigrant who resides in New York. I came here in search of opportunities both economic and educational that were not available to me on my native island of Trinidad and Tobago. I wanted a better life for myself and I wanted the opportunity to travel and see the world. I also wanted to return one day and give back to my community. My dreams were and still are pretty ambitious ones. Assimilating into the American culture was a bit challenging at first. I quickly learned that the African American culture and that of West Indian culture were vastly different. We may look the same as people of the African diaspora but our experiences and way of life differed immensely. Growing up I was educated under the British Colonial Education system and spoke the Queens English. Yet, In America, Americans often corrected me for not speaking proper English simply because of my accent. This angered me and I often grew frustrated because I was being judged because I sounded different and not because my English was inaccurate. I quickly learned that as an immigrant you are quite frequently considered The Other, a term that signifies being different to the norm or mainstream American. I struggled internally with this label of immigrant and being different. However, It was my first boss, an Italian immigrant himself who changed my thoughts and empowered me not to accept this label but to use each opportunity I got to make a better life for myself. One day while dropping me off at the train station after working for another family in the neighborhood who refused to pay me my full day wages he said to me, Kid, the only difference between you and another person is the fact that they got an opportunity in life that you did not have. Dont you ever allow anyone to make you feel any less of a person than you are. I held on to those simple words and they have been my motivation ever since. I made it a priority to seize every opportunity that I encountered that would position me one step closer to accomplishing my dreams. It has been 14 years since I migrated to this country since April 2002. Today, I am proud to report that I am no longer considered an immigrant but a productive citizen of the United States of America. I have made good on every opportunity that I was blessed with. Three weeks ago I graduated from CUNY Medgar Evers College, Summa Cum Laude with a BA in Childhood Special Education. In August, I will begin my MA in the Literacy Specialist Program at Teachers College Columbia University. I have earned my seat at the table. I am now able to advocate for myself and the people behind me that were once in my position. Its ironic that people seldom ask me where am I from anymore. That accent that was once frowned upon is now being exalted as being exotic. I still sound the same, but pursuing a tertiary level education has afforded me a seat at their table. I can now speak their language and negotiate on their terms. I am well on my way to crafting that better life I once dreamt about. I am also still committed to giving back to my community and remembering my humble beginnings. But I will always remember that old saying my grandmother religiously preached to us while growing up as a young child in the countryside. If you give a man a fish, you can only feed him for a day. But, if you teach him to fish, you can feed him for life. I have seized every opportunity, and I have learned how to fish. Now I can feed myself for life and teach others to do the same.
187	Carbonet	Democratic Republic of the Congo	Australia	A	O	far	506	55823	H	im	male	"I was born in Congo and lived there until I was around 11 years old. I have very few memories of my life in Congo but I know my family had cows and I loved the weather. Those are the few things I remember about home. After Rwanda, the war came also to Congo. I moved with my parents, brothers and sisters to a refugee camp in Rwanda. I lived in the refugee camp for nearly 20 years. I finished school in the refugee camp and later completed a university degree in Finance. Soon after I graduated, I got a job in the administration department of the university. In the refugee camp I met my now wife. In 2010, before we got married, she came to Australia as a refugee, but we stayed in touch. In 2015 we got married and after 3 months I came to live with her in Australia. We now have a beautiful daughter. When I first arrived in Australia I remember I was surprised that everyone had a car; Africa is different, and even if you have a good job you dont necessarily have a car. But the only thing that mattered was that we were here to stay.  We were only supposed to live temporarily in Rwanda as refugees, we were waiting all the time, limited to what we could plan and do. In Australia we feel like we belong. We are not waiting anymore. Im happy for the opportunities I have in Australia, but I also miss my family. I moved with my wife but I had to leave my parents, brothers and sisters behind. I visit them every now and then, but I miss them every day. I now dream of getting an job in administration. Im planning to go to university and after that I will look for a better job. I want a good life for my wife and daughter."
188	Carlos	Bolivia	Switzerland	L	E	far	3133	86919	H	im	male	My name is Carlos, I arrived in Switzerland at the age of 13 with my two brothers. When I first arrived I had a strange feeling because everything was new to me, I wasnt sure what to do because I left all my friendships and everything behind. I didnt even speak French. My mum was already in Switzerland and shes the one that did everything to get us here to join her. I started seeing people from different nationalities although I honestly thought Id only see Swiss people in Switzerland. That wasnt the case when I found people from different nationalities, cultures, races, and religions. It took me three years to get integrated in the country but I learnt French by the first year. After some problems with the justice sector here during my adolescent years, I decided to turn the page and start moving forward. I decided to allocate my time to work in the social services and helping other young ones like I was, especially the ones that just arrive in Switzerland as Ive been through their struggle. I received my Swiss nationality a year and a half ago so I guess Im Swiss now. In a couple of days Im going to do my military service. These are things I decided to do because I wanted to feel completely integrated in this country and be a part of it. I believe that the more interested you are about the culture and discovering new things about where you are, the better you get to share that with those around you. The more you learn about the different cultures the more you understand the people and become compassionate towards them. Ive been living here for eight years now so I consider myself Swiss. Every day that passes is a new adventure for me and I love what I do. Helping other young ones with behaviour risk is fulfilling for me because I feel like Im giving back to society what I learnt when I was younger. And thats my satisfaction. For me integration is when you see what people do around you as normal, the culture and customs become familiar to me and no longer strange. Its also to be interested in everything happening around you. Its important to keep an open mind towards the new society so you can get integrated in it. We shouldnt be afraid to go out of the bubble and meet new people. At the end of the day even if we have different colour or religion or background we are all still human beings, we have common grounds and its only ideologies that differentiate us. For me every day I meet somebody new is a better integration.
189	Carlos	El Salvador	México	L	L	close	3799	8326	E	im	male	Carlos is a Salvadoran plastic surgeon who decided to migrate to Guadalajara, Mexico, with a huge amount of optimism. When I arrived, I thought that this was a lovely city but I also felt a funny kind of fear, the kind you feel when something is new. I was worried that people would look at me funny for being different. I told myself Im here to start a new phase of my life. At the same moment, I wished I could get on the plane and back to El Salvador. But I also wanted to absorb the most amount of knowledge I could so I could go back home and apply it, so I stayed. I only arrived with my clothes and my wishes to grow. At the beginning, I had help from some close family friends. They let me stay with them until I got used to the city. I miss my family and the distances in El Salvador. Everything is so far away here, not like in El Salvador. I also miss my friends and going to the beach on Friday, having dinner there and returning at midnight under the stars. Migrating here is a new phase in my life in which, I believe, all the effort I put into it will come back to me as gain tomorrow. My family is happy that Im growing but sad that Im not with them. They know that I want to have more professional experience and this journey also helps in knowing myself more while remaining optimistic.
190	Carlos	India	Italy	I	E	far	1931	31238	H	im	male	My name is Carlos. My name might not give it away, but Im Indian. I come from Goa, which many people think is an island and in some ways it is - Goa was a Portuguese colony for almost 500 years so it is a cultural island of sorts. I arrived in Italy on 21 September, 1980 to enroll in a journalist course at university because my college back in India had given me a small scholarship to study abroad. I chose to come to Italy because my uncle was serving as the Portuguese ambassador in Rome, so I would have had a family member to rely on. However, three months after my arrival, my uncle was transferred to Turkey and I was left completely on my own. I was the only foreigner in Milan, the only dark-skinned person around the city. I didnt speak any Italian, but I knew Portuguese and that helped a lot. The journalism course I was interested in only had 15 spots available and you had to be interviewed by one of the professors to get in. Of course, the interview was conducted in Italian. I still remember that day, it was November 23, 1980. I struggled a lot because I couldnt express my thoughts in Italian, and I even started to tear up a little. But they chose me! There were 15 spots. and they chose me. One year later, while studying at university, I met Isabella, who is my wife now.  I was 21 years old and she was 18. She felt like she was dating some kind of pirate because I had long hair and all, but it was only because I couldnt afford to go to a salon and get a haircut! At 20 years old I had never even seen a TV set before. A few months before I got there, my brother had been in Italy for vacation and experienced the 1980 FIFA European Championship which was hosted in the country that year. I later asked him, How does filming a football game work? Cameramen chase football players around to get footage? He said yes so I asked, Doesnt it bother the football players? Neither of us had grasped how football could be aired on television. In a way, I am a migrant but Italy gave me so much that, at this stage of my life, it is impossible not to feel Italian more than anything else. This is not to say that I didnt face many hardships - I struggled with money and bureaucracy. In Italy I always felt more than welcome. People were intrigued by my differences, I was the Indian and they treated me like a mythical figure. I have my own company now, where I work with my wife on several language programs financed by the European Union and the Lombardy region. After 35 years of living here I definitely feel at home.
191	Carlota	Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)	Belgium	L	E	far	3740	45028	H	im	female	Being in Belgium, Ive learnt about my country from a different perspective. People who have met me now tell me they have been learning and reading more about my country. Its been really interesting to share Venezuela with them. I can show all the bad incidents thats happened, but at the same time I can show the most beautiful beach you will ever see in your life. Ive also met people who identify as socialists but havent lived the effects of socialism. In Venezuela there are significant shortages right now. There are no longer availability of items like toilet paper, sugar, and flour. These things are considered basic goods. If one manages to find them theyre usually very expensive or you have to queue for three hours to buy them. Its often difficult for me being so far away from Venezuela. For the first time since I was eighteen I couldnt vote in the national assembly elections. This was difficult because I grew up in a really politicized country. For me, voting is super important. That day I was so anxious I vacuumed my room seven times. I really did want to get away for a short period though, I actually wanted to move forever. Coming to Belgium served me well. It helped me identify way more with what it means to be Venezuelan and a Latina living abroad. I started to become more self-aware. I had to leave to really appreciate that. Living in Brussels makes me miss my mom, Its always just been the two of us. Ive had some really difficult days here in Belgium where Im lonely or homesick, but that will change soon. Recently, the Spanish government passed a law declaring that anyone who could prove they were Sephardic Jews whose ancestors had been expelled from Spain in the 1400s/1500s could be eligible for Spanish citizenship. My mom decided this was going to be her personal project. She made a family tree that dates back to the 1500s, It took her a year. The tree was certified and the next step is to take a test that my mom already passed. Im very excited to see where this path takes us.
192	Carmela	Peru	United States	L	N	far	6163	63123	H	im	female	"I was just eight years old when I left Peru. Until then, the only parents I knew were my biological grandparents and I was taken away from them.  I was left in their care from infancy while my parents migrated to United States as my dad had found work in New York City. Upon arrival in NYC I felt mostly confused, like I did not belong. I felt like an outsider. My integration was, in a nutshell, very difficult. I cannot recall any fond memories for a long time. So here I was, far away from the only home I had ever known. I did not speak the language and was now living with my biological parents and younger sister who was born in the US. I did not really know them at all; they did not feel like my family. My integration was not easy on them either; I could see that now, my sister and I would fight a lot. I am also an incest survivor. I survived 8 years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of my biological father when I moved to New York. And when I turned 19, my father was finally incarcerated for the abuse and eventually deported to Peru. This had a life-changing impact on everyone. His visa was revoked and I also left the country to avoid testifying against him. It was a painful period for all of us - my mother and sister in the US and my grandparents and other family in Peru. I then moved back to Peru but didnt feel like I belonged there either. I had lost some of my native language and upon my return people kept asking me where I came from and why I was back in Peru, which was too painful and complicated to explain fully. Eventually I grew tired having to explain that I was Peruvian and this was my birth place. I continued to feel lost and alienated and felt like I had no choice but to return to the US one year later, undocumented. Upon my return, education became the most important thing to me. I worked two jobs to take me through Bronx Community College and even got married while at City College. I am currently completing my Masters in Social work at Columbia University – this is a lifelong dream being realized and something that I feel very passionate about. I now work with immigrant families and survivors of domestic abuse and often share my story with them. I feel open and empowered enough to share my story with the world and I can see that it makes a difference, that my life and experiences matter. I feel as though I can bring something unique to the table - I can identify with what many of them are going through, particularly undocumented migrants.  That feeling of being undocumented can be overwhelming, it is easy to loose motivation, to lose hope. In the end, my life is testimony that a lot of things can happen along the way, bad things, but you have to keep going. Set goals and keep working towards achieving these goals. I am now happily married with a step-son and a loving husband. My relationship with my mother and sister continues to improve over time."
193	Carol	Cameroon	Niger	A	A	close	1502	568	E	im	female	"I have always considered myself an orphan. My aunt had a miscarriage when she was younger and she couldnt ever get pregnant again after that. By tradition, you are supposed to give a child to women who cant bear any children. I was my mothers first born. Im happy that my aunt raised me in Gabon. When I was 13, I moved back to Cameroon. That is when I met my parents and siblings for the first time. I didnt grow up with my family so I was always the one having to make compromises. Life was not easy. My father was killed by his own brothers and my mom had decided to go to Europe with a passport she had paid for. Once at the airport she was told her papers were fake and she had a heart attack. At some point, I wanted to go somewhere where I could feel safe and happy and find some peace. My dream was to become an interior designer. I wanted to find a good school to learn this craft, and then go back, open my own business and eventually open an orphanage. So I decided to go to Italy but earn money in Algeria first. But there was no work for foreign women there except maybe prostitution. You either live in a brothel or marry someone for a limited period of time. I could not do this for money – never. So I decided to go back. The way back through the desert was horrible: there were dead people, women being raped. At some point, the smugglers divided us in two groups. If they liked your face, they told you to stay. I was so scared; I didnt know where I was. I am lucky and grateful that nobody hurt me. I never saw the others again. People need to know what this route is like; they need to know the truth."

She was born and raised there before moving to Bogota to study and to seek for professional opportunities. Barranquilla is the fourth largest city in the country. Its very sunny and people are very welcoming and super charming. We have a carnival so we are happy all the time, Carolina says of her hometown. Although Carolina has been only robbed on the streets of Bogota, she witnessed a lot of crimes that cant make you feel safe when you are out of your house. Colombia is her home country, and yet she no longer feels safe there. She traveled to several places before settling in the United States. Her first memory of being in the United States is the sense of safety she felt. I could just walk in the streets alone, late at night and I would just stay calm. I thought that nothing could happen to me. I felt empowered. Now, Carolina lives in Washington  where she interns with the Organization of American States.  is really rich culturally speaking: you have old things with new scenes events. Here I can be myself. By just saying I am from Colombia, people get interested. It is where a lot of people from different backgrounds and different countries converge in one only spot. Its enriching everybodys lives and everybodys experience.
195	Caroline	Kenya	Ireland	A	E	far	1879	86251	H	im	female	"In May 2007, I received the news that I was going to study in Ireland. I had planned to go to another EU country which I knew more about because friends and relative had travelled there, but I did not know so much about Ireland. I looked online and learned a little bit about Dublin where I would be based. When you read about something and then you see it, its different. When I arrived in Ireland it was breathtaking, considering that it was the first European country that I had visited and indeed the first country that I had visited outside Africa. Ireland is quite different to Kenya and I had to get used to it. Although the family I stayed with may not have fully understood what I was going through, they were supportive - still are, even after I moved on - and patient, giving me time to get used to the country especially when I was experiencing with new foods. But I really miss my family a lot, though. Sometimes I wish Ireland was more like Kenya. For example, the Irish are warm to me and are very friendly but I feel that in Kenya people talk and visit each other more. Of course, I understand why these things are different. It could be because of the weather or that in Ireland they are busier than people in Kenya. Actually, maybe people talk to each other more in Kenyan villages because people in Nairobi are very busy and do not visit each other a lot either. I feel quite at home; I love it here. Since I have completed my studies, it may be time to leave, but Ireland now has a very special place in my heart. I consider it home. Whenever I go to Kenya now, I feel more like a visitor there. My experience in Ireland has been fantastic. I have had a very good time here. I came to study and now I have my PhD, so Ireland and the Irish have definitely been good to me."
196	Catherine	France	United Kingdom	E	E	close	38959	40718	E	im	female	I came to N.Ireland as a student in 81, in the middle of the troubles, met some great people, learnt to love the place and stayed. I have worked as a French Assistant, childminder, waitress, collective worker in a cooperative cafe and bookshop, care home assistant, writer, designer, administrator and events organiser in a feminist magazine, publications officer in an NGO and now communications worker. I have volunteered in local community groups, LGBT groups, ethnic minority organisations, women's groups. Like many people here, I have sometimes been unemployed, and more times in work. I love Irish/Northern Irish society although I don't love everything about it. Belfast has taught me a lot and it's now home. It's where I have my second family, where I gave birth to a beautiful son, made lifelong friends, developed my skills and ideas. I don't claim to be saving everyone or making a special contribution. I just live my life, like everyone else, somewhere where I am happy and have grown new roots. I have no more nor less right than anyone else to be here, same as I think everyone has as much right as me to be in Brittany where I come from, where my first family is, where half of my culture comes from. I would no more dream of giving up my culture or origins than I would of giving up on my parents. I am a hybrid, the product of two cultures, two places. I hope I have passed on to my children a sense that every human being has rights and value, and that diversity is a beautiful thing.
197	Cécile	Democratic Republic of the Congo	Italy	A	E	far	506	31238	H	im	female	"I still remember my mothers words when I left: 'Dont come back until you have found what youre looking for. You must be strong, because one day your job will save many lives.' And so I came to Italy to fulfill my dream of becoming a doctor. I managed to find a place to stay with the help of a Hungarian priest, who was a refugee. And a few years later, I became an ophthalmologist. In 1994, I married an Italian man and since then, little by little, I started to look beyond my personal dream, diverting my attention towards other peoples struggles, in particular the rights of migrants and the promotion of multiculturalism. Im doing a lot of things today that were not part of my life plans; but living and integrating in this country have inspired me to take on a commitment that was .meant to be. My experience in politics is part of this commitment. At the beginning, it was hard for me to understand that I was representing a strong symbol for Italy: I was the first black minister in the history of the Italian Republic! The President, Giorgio Napolitano, could have declined my Ministry designation but he wanted to create a cultural rupture. Not everyone agreed with his choice. Now I realize how important it is, not only for Italy, but for the rest of the world, that designations like mine can open a political debate. Sure, there is still a lot of work to do about discrimination. I had to face many personal attacks, but my victory in the European elections shows that things are already changing. As an EU diplomat, I now split my time between Modena, Italy and Brussels in Belgium. Always being on the move, on a plane or a train also feels a little bit like home to me now. I try to find short moments to relax, read a magazine. Sometimes I wonder where home really is. When I went to Congo a couple of years ago, I felt like a foreigner and I caught myself saying Its time to go back home now, back to Italy. I genuinely feel at home in Modena: its my city, with its smells, its colors, and its people.   Cécile Kyenge Kashetu was the Minister of Integration of the Letta Government and the first black Minister of Italy. Since 2014 she is a Member of the European Parliament."
198	Cecilia	México	Estonia	L	E	far	8326	23106	E	im	female	It all starts with a desire for adventure and excitement. My mother recalls at the tender age of four, I already wanted to travel the world and learn about new cultures. When my aunt travelled to China, I asked her to bring me the Little Mermaid book in Chinese to teach myself the language. I didnt, but the book was my greatest treasure. The wanderlust was also enhanced by my father who sailed across the ocean's as part of the Mexican Navy's medical team. I cried when I couldnt go along. Later in adolescence, I started taking steps towards travel: I started studying foreign languages and applying for Erasmus programs abroad. Unfortunately, I had to wait until I was 21 before I could step foot on European soil for the first time. That first four-month experience was incomparable, but soon I was back home and wishing for more. I wrote down my sightseeing bucket list: Taj Mahal, Bioluminescent Seas, Northern Lights, learning German, trying out new foods… these last three reasons brought Estonia into my life. There were some huge misunderstandings, because Estonia is not exactly known for these three things, but I'm happy to report that I have practiced German here, I have seen impressive northern lights in the sky and although I havent eaten bear meat yet, I have tried other good dishes. In all aspects, Estonia seemed like a promised land, full of snow (which I had never seen) and with possibilities to travel to other nearby countries I hadnt been to before. I still remember the winter when I packed my bags in Mexico to come here. It was 16C back in Veracruz, my home city, and it felt cold as hell. 24 hours later I was in -22C Estonian weather and I could hardly breathe, but I was still happy and excited. I keep traveling and finding new ventures, which is one of the reasons I stayed in Europe. Estonia has also helped me a lot to develop myself as a professional. The start-up sentiment is widespread and technology is in constant growth, represented in almost all companies. It rewires the way you think and approach challenges and life itself, and I feel Estonia is the right place to be now. I would encourage anyone looking to develop themselves professionally to have a good look at Estonia. The quietness and timid environment have pushed me to learn to be alone. I have rediscovered passions I had given up before like writing and illustrating. On cold winter days, I stay home and illustrate using different techniques. I also write for my blog. People might be scared of the loneliness and the dark nights here during winter. But I have always believed, you need only yourself to be happy and content, therefore you can be happy under any type of conditions. Estonian people can be cold and pragmatic even once you get to know them well, its just the way they are. It goes without saying that there are also many characteristics to admire, from their individuality to their work hard attitude, and they are also some of the most honest people I met. I have also been quite lucky to meet very welcoming Estonians, and expats like me who I can call family now. I miss my country, of course, and I desperately miss warmer weather. But its really comforting to know that when Im done challenging myself, I can always go back. I miss my mother and my brother the most. Missing people has somehow helped me become a better person. Every second of my time in this life is valuable. My wishes have also been re-accommodated: although I still long to travel a bit more and keep developing myself, one thing has become really clear - my most important goal is to be happy and make others happy.
199	Cecilia Violetta	United States	United States	N	N	close	63123	63123	E	hc	female	Born in Rupert, Idaho, to migrant farm workers from Mexico, Cecilia worked alongside her parents hoeing beets to earn extra income for the family in the summers. To make the time go faster, her mother would sing ranchera, or mariachi songs. We worked long hours in hot and cold weather. It was during those long hours where my mother planted the musical seed in me and taught me and my older brother songs that she knew and grew up with, Cecilia said. My mother had no formal musical training but I can proudly say that I looked up to her back then for being a beautiful, wise and strong woman and for being so knowledgeable about music. As Cecilia grew older, her mother volunteered her to sing at rodeos, weddings and quinceanera parties, both in the Magic Valley and in Mexico. Her parents also bought her a tiny organ keyboard at a second-hand store. She took lessons but she also demonstrated a talent for playing tunes by ear. She attended the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, planning to study music education but became fascinated with the operatic repertoire and the science behind the operatic voice. Having a career in opera was not something I aimed for as a child. In fact, my first experience with opera was watching soprano icon Beverly Sills on Sesame Street, which I watched to learn English, Cecilia said. At the time, I remember thinking the singing was a little strange but never thought about it again. But in college I became fascinated with it and was accepted into the vocal performance program. The road from college to stage appears to have been paved in gold. One day, she got the opportunity to show her mother the rehearsal process for Madama Butterfly so she could witness firsthand the work that goes on before a show goes to the actual stage. Thats when she told me, This is a job. You work long hours every day for this one show. After my final performance of Madama Butterfly, my father who never speaks English to us, said, Im so proud of you, in the thickest Mexican accent anyone has ever heard. Moments like those replay in my mind often and they are some of the many things that I keep with me that help keep me moving forward.
200	Celina	Argentina	Ireland	L	E	far	8476	86251	H	im	female	Celina Vieites and her future Irish husband were sitting in a cafe in Buenos Aires the day he popped the question. He said, Would you like to go out?, but I didnt understand. I thought he meant leave the cafe. I said, Wait until I finish my tea, and he went completely white. He thought it was a rejection. Dating an Irish man was a refreshing and welcome break from her usual Argentinian boyfriends. Argentinian men would be all over you all the time. You go to any pub or nightclub in Argentina and men grab at you. Theres even now a campaign for women to be respected because its very macho. Celinas husband, Macdara Mac Cathmhaoil, was so slow at making a move she began questioning whether he was interested at all. The couple met at a cultural exchange in 2009 soon after Macdara moved to Argentina to learn Spanish. He was chat, chat, chat. His Spanish is actually quite good but hes very lazy so he never speaks it so all the conversations were in English. Hes kind of international man of mystery, he speaks a little bit of lots of languages. Basically since that moment we never left each other.
201	Ciska	Netherlands	Germany	E	E	close	53334	45909	E	im	female	I have been living in Berlin for nine years now. It is difficult to describe my profession, but maybe Cooking Activist fits it quite well I quit my job in the Netherlands and did not know, what I would do in Berlin. But then I walked into a cookbook-shop and discovered they had a cooking studio as well. I asked, if they offer classes for Indonesian cuisine, or cooking classes for children – they did not and I could start right away. Initially we just wanted to stay here for a year and see how we liked it. But after nine years, were still here and I dont think that well be leaving. We knew Berlin beforehand from visiting people here. Yet, there was even more diversity in every aspect of life than we had expected. Im actually a lecturer for textiles, art and painting, but I always used to cook a lot and learned from my mother. I teach Indonesian cooking, because I discovered that there is barely any Indonesian food around here and no one knew Indonesian cuisine. But since I was always engaged in social and cultural activities, that was not enough for me. So I founded enak, a club where we organise Indonesian events with music and Indonesian food. This year we also started to cook with refugees a lot. In September 2014 I also founded the group Cooking for peace. Our aim is to bring Israelis and Palestinians together through cooking. It is our way to practise peace here in Berlin. Sometimes I think the Germans attach too much importance to papers and permissions. On the other hand, Dutch people are better organised, describe their aims better, and are more concise. But other than that I am very happy here. For Ciska, whose parents were migrants as well – they came from Indonesia to the Netherlands in the 1950s - home simply means joy.
202	Claire	France	Switzerland	E	E	close	38959	86919	E	im	female	I was very nervous when I arrived in Argentina, because of the language. My dream was to live in Latin America. Claire is French and moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, when she was 20 years old. She went to live in San Cristóbal, a poor neighbourhood where she believed she could experience the real Argentina.  For me it was more interesting than living in the 'best' areas of the city, because what you get in these areas is more a European vision. However, she suffered there from a different sort of prejudice. When you go to a supermarket or a flea market people say: Oh, you are French, so you can pay more Just because I am French people think I am rich, I got tired of it. After four years, she decided to leave Buenos Aires and had to find where home was for her again. When you live so far away for such a long time you still have your own culture and values, but you also identify with the new culture. I can't say that I am completely French anymore, because when you leave your country for so long, you lose things, habits, but you also gain a lot from the new place you live in. Sometimes I ask myself about my own identity. But after all, what is the difference between Barack Obama, the Syrian refugees, me or you … at the end of the day we are simply human beings. Now Claire is living in Geneva, where she feels that the culture is closer to the French one. I feel like home, we are close to the mountains like in my hometown in the Pyrenees, there is good wine and I know the social and cultural codes… I do not have to think about  how I have to behave.
203	Claire	United Kingdom	Belgium	E	E	close	40718	45028	E	im	female	My mothers parents are from Barbados, they came to the UK on a ship a long time ago, and my father is half English, half Italian. Home for me is London, but my grandparents would say home is Barbados, and now I live in Brussels which kind of counts as a home as well so its a bit difficult for me to pick just one. Home is where the people I love are, a place that Im familiar with. Barbados is where my family comes from, and my roots are there. London is where I grew up and its the place I go back to the most, so I miss the familiarity of that place, and I miss being able to walk down the road and bump into friends that Ive known for years. But beyond that, its nice to get to be in different places and to experience different cultures. My job is in Brussels now, and home is so many different things that cant be narrowed down into one solid concept. My earliest experience of racism was when I was about 13 years old, I was getting off the tube and a man turned around and used some explicit language to exclaim that there were black people everywhere. My initial response at that time was anger. And then I think to a similar incident from only a few years ago when I was in Spain, and I was walking down the street with my partner. Someone shouted at us because they werent happy about the mixed-race relationship that they were seeing, but I was able to shrug it off that time. At work day to day I experience it in the way people talk to me, and the things they expect from me, especially as a black woman. I want to say that it happens irregularly, but still often enough to be a bit irritating. But you learn, you grow and you try to help educate people to see that their ignorance isnt beneficial to anyone. Bringing people together and fostering understanding can lead to a huge breakdown of xenophobia and prejudice.
204	Claude	United Kingdom	Belgium	E	E	close	40718	45028	E	im	male	Im an immigrant to the EU, and one of the few members of the European Parliament thats an immigrant from outside of the European Union. Im of Indian descent, but I had also lived for some time in Yemen, so I spoke Arabic as well as my mother tongue languages. I came to the United Kingdom from India when I was four years old, and settled in Scotland where I grew up. After many years I became a member of the European Parliament representing London. I am an immigrant, and I have spent most of life working on the topic of migration. Home is always a very flexible concept, I dont think you ever feel completely settled. And whatever people say, its also an issue of race and colour. You can feel assimilated if you look the same as the rest of society, but for me in the UK and in the European Union, my colour is always going to be an issue. The idea that diversity just means people from different regions speaking different languages is just not true – we dont see enough people whose origins may lie outside of the European Union, or who have different race and nationality backgrounds, represented in European institutions. You can be proud to be European and have a multicultural identity, but there will always be a draw to your country of origin, and I feel that this is particularly true for people from visible minorities. In many ways, for us, assimilation is a meaningless concept. Growing up in 1970s Scotland, I experienced all kinds of racism, discrimination and harassment – in the political field its more subtle but its all around. The numbers of visible ethnic minorities have declined since I first came to the European Parliament in 1999.  We do not have the diversity we should have. For anyone coming in from outside the EU today, I would advise them to preserve their identity and their self-confidence. Barriers still exist for newcomers to the EU, so that confidence will be necessary to overcome them, but opportunities for advancement do exist.
205	Claudia	Italy	Ireland	E	E	close	31238	86251	E	im	female	"Moving to Dublin has been a great experience, one I would probably do again, since I got a job here, something I had found impossible in Italy. However, I know one day I will either change country again or move back to Italy. The fact that I had already visited Dublin before moving here, and knew some Irish people, helped me settle in. I thought Ireland was much more relaxed than Rome, and it was easier to get around. I knew Ireland was a very religious country, and I could see this in some Irish people I met. I have to say that although Irish people have been friendly and welcoming, I have found some of the cultural differences problematic. It was hard to adapt to life in Ireland and I don't think I ever will fully adapt, but I think this is due to cultural differences, and not the people. Also the longer I stay here the more the rain starts to take its toll on me. The lifestyle and habits are also different. Most of the socialising in Ireland is done through drinking and I really don't drink much. In fact, I actually started to drink a bit in this country, but it is not something I particularly enjoy. I don't know where to start when talking about what I miss about Rome. I miss hearing Roman; the type of humour. I especially miss the food, wandering around Romes narrow streets and finding a new monument or something interesting everyday despite living there for over 20 years. I miss my family and friends. Generally, I miss how we live over there. I dont think I could ever consider Ireland home. I live here and in a way it is home, but I don't think I belong here. I feel like I'm living a life in-between two countries and all the time I can't wait to go to Rome and when I'm back there, I miss Dublin quite a bit. I think that no matter where I will live, Rome will always be home."
206	Claudine	Burundi	Burundi	A	A	close	286	286	E	hc	female	My name is Claudine. I am 29 years old, married, and the mother of 4 children. I have been living in Tanzania since I was a child. I grew up there and I met my first husband who was a Tanzanian national. We were a strong couple and lived together for 6 very happy years. We had a house, with manioc and groundnut fields, and a few cows. When they decided to expel all the Burundians who had not regularized their stay in Tanzania, my husband tried to convince the authorities to let me stay in Tanzania, without success. One day I was in the fields I was chased away while my husband and older daughter were in the market. They just let me take my 3 younger children and no personal belongings. I came back to Burundi and settled in my parents property that our neighbors had kept for us. My parents had died previously in Tanzania. I have now been back in Burundi for two years and I miss my oldest daughter who remained in Tanzania with her father. Ive since heard that my husband got remarried, and I was originally hoping to reconnect with him, but I am still afraid to look for him because of what happened to me. To move forward and avoid remembering what I went through in Tanzania, I joined a saving and credit association where I met other women who experienced the similar, or worse, situations. We comfort each other, help each other, and so my life is starting to become normal again. I also got remarried. Our association was given a mill and a groundnut field. That helped reinforce social cohesion among us. Currently, with members of our association, we are like brothers and sisters. When one of us gets sick, we arrange visits. I requested a credit of 20.000 Burundian Francs, so our association can start a banana wine business. With the support of my new husband, I just bought a bike which I use to transport the bananas. My relationship with my husband has also improved since I started contributing financially to the household. Whenever I start feeling nostalgic and sad about my past in Tanzania, I can consult a member of the community trained in psychosocial assistance to find relief. I would say that my life is now balanced.
207	Clément	France	Netherlands	E	E	close	38959	53334	E	im	male	"My dads family originally comes from Italy, and from an early age, I always knew that we were migrants somehow. Since my parents were considered expats for many years and me and my sisters grew  up abroad, travelling and being outside France was seen as normal and pretty cool. As a young adult I first moved to Spain in 2003 for a year, following a woman there. Then I became a press photographer and I travelled the world, eventually settling in Hungary for four years. I then decided to move back to Paris but soon left  for Amsterdam, where I am currently based. I really love this city. I immediately felt at home. I felt good. This city is so pretty, so small, so easy to discover and people were extremely friendly. People are friendly, maybe because they consider me as a highly-skilled migrant. I just hope an asylum seeker will have the same treatment that I received when I arrived. Of course, I miss France's diversity, especially Pariss multicultural environment where I can see people of different colours, background and languages. I think people have a pretty strong opinion about French people, the way we are, the way we think, or speak. So yes, I definitely played the frenchy card when I arrived in Amsterdam. Dutch people are friendly but they are not really used to have someone pushy when having a conversation. Being French was a good excuse for me to keep being direct and asking questions. Dutch and French people are different but I am not sure we can talk about a mix of cultures neither. Diversity is to me a fact, not something to discuss. Different origins, background, cultures are making us better; Better citizens, better women and men. I am working as a photojournalist, and I would be happy if I could help make the public aware of what's going on in the world, and help showcase stories that impact humanity. I want to open people eyes. My country, France, is not doing well now. And Im ashamed to see what is currently happening with the refugees and migrants there. I believe France is great because we are all coming from lots of different parts of the world, and that's what makes France so great! At the end of the day, Amsterdam is home for me now. When I was living in Spain 12 years ago, I felt as if I was in exile. I didn't have much money and I was often alone and it was really painful to stay there somehow. Now, I can say I am a lucky man. I feel at home."

They are giving me everything – shoes, clothes, support. I dont know how to thank them for what they have done for me. A refugee who fled Sudans civil war in search of a better life, Mutwakil has been attending the weekly Club Together sessions at the Herlingshaw Centre in Middlesbroughs South Bank since it began last year. Established by the Championship clubs MFC Foundation in conjunction with local charity the Methodist Asylum Project, the project brings together more than 30 refugees and asylum seekers to socialise, learn English and, more importantly, indulge in their true passion: football. This is my favourite session of the week. Its been brilliant, says Paul South from MFC Foundation. The guys really enjoy it and are really grateful for the opportunity. Wearing the Boro kit gives them a sense of identity. In a city that became synonymous for the rising tensions between the UKs existing population and the new arrivals in 2016, that is particularly important. The Home Office has only recently started sending asylum seekers to Middlesbrough again after they became a target for vandals after initially being housed in accommodation that made them easily identifiable by their red doors. An investigation last year found that more than five times as many destitute asylum seekers live in the poorest third of the country as in the richest third, with the strain felt most by local councils and charities. The new influx to Middlesbrough since the end of last year has led to an increase in those wishing to attend the Club Together sessions, and South admits he has been forced to abandon English lessons for now. We had a lot of new arrivals just before Christmas and the club donated 50 full kits, he says. Without being able to work, theres not a lot of structure in the lives of the guys that come to our sessions – they go to the drop-in centre and thats about it. So this is great for helping them to meet new people and integrate into society.

She is participating in a voluntary programme of the League of Youth Voluntary Service and works at Belarusian Childrens Hospice, a charity helping terminally ill children. I thought it would be really difficult for me. But when I see these kids, I realize that they are just as wonderful as other children. Among the countries available for this program (France, Spain, Russia, Belarus), Constanze chose Belarus. I wanted to see a country which would be different from Germany, and Belarus seemed to be just like that. Of course, in the beginning I was afraid to move here for a full year. I thought that I would not find friends, that I wouldnt be able to do sports here and that, in general, it would be very difficult to adapt to the new culture and lifestyle. The only thing that made me more or less confident was my knowledge of Russian: my parents moved to Germany from Kazakhstan, so I could already speak Russian. When I arrived, everything turned out to be the exact opposite of my fears. I felt really at ease here. I love Belarus, it is cozy and very hospitable: if you are a guest somewhere you will not leave until without having a cup of tea with sweets first. Im convinced that in a year I will be able to call Belarus my second home. And it goes without saying that I will recommend my friends to visit Belarus. In my opinion one can only benefit from living in a different country.
210	Consuelo	Colombia	United Kingdom	L	E	far	5333	40718	H	im	female	"I am a migrant worker living in London and this is my experience. Migrant workers are crucial to the running of this country. I personally believe that as a cleaner I contribute to this country in two ways. Firstly, as a cleaner at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), I help to create a suitable and safe environment for the students. Cleaners play a crucial role in the running of this institution. The university will not be able to function, if we have not done the cleaning before student arrives. This was shown during our three days of strike when part of the university was closed due to health and safety reasons. On the other hand, as UNISON representative, I help to organise hundreds workers, improving the standards of leaving of migrant and non-migrants low pay workers alike. We do not put wages down, in fact we do the opposite. Thanks to our campaign, we won major improvements to our contractual terms such as the London Living Wage in 2008 and 35 days of holidays, sick pay from day one of employment and 7% pension contribution in 2014. This is my personal story: My name is Consuelo Moreno. I am Colombian and I arrived in London in January of 2002. I came to the UK with my husband and my daughter. I wanted to work to be able to support my family and I was looking for better opportunities for my daughter. Back home, I started studying law but didn't have the chance to finish my degree. I am currently working for three different cleaning companies, in three different places. I have to do so in order to survive. I wake up at 2.50 in the morning. I work from 4am to 9am in my first job, from 11 to 1pm in my second job. Then I go home, clean my own house and do some cooking. From 3 pm to 5 pm I see my husband. My daughter comes home at 4.45 but then I have to leave at 5 pm to do another job from 6 pm to 8 am. Then I go back home and we all eat together. When I have time, I like watching movies, going on the seaside and dance salsa. This is my experience working as outsourced cleaner at SOAS. In January 2004 I began working at SOAS as a cleaner for 5 hours per day. In August of 2005, another company took over the cleaning services at SOAS and it was at that time when all the problems began. The new management wanted to reduce my working hours by 2 hours per day. I refused to accept this reduction and then I began to be victim of workplace harassment and intimidation. I felt deeply stressed and began to feel fear every day I went to work. It was like a living nightmare. A friend of mine who knew about my situation advised me to go and talk with UNISON. I went to see the SOAS UNISON representative and he helped me to initiate a grievance procedure against my manager for his attempt to unilaterally reduce my salary and workplace harassment. It was a success. They did not reduce my working hours and they stopped harassing me. However, new problems emerged. We began to have problems with payment to the extent that some colleagues did not receive any pay for 3 months. UNISON once again intervened and the company paid the salaries very quickly. In 2006, I was elected as worker representative and I began, with my co-representatives, to actively organise our workplace. We formed the Justice for Cleaners SOAS campaign. We started to demand union recognition, the London Living Wage, and equal pension, holiday and sick pay to those working directly for the university. In 2008, we achieved 2 of the demands, union recognition and the London Living Wage. Despite winning the London Living Wage and union recognition, this represented only a partial gain since we were still working under inferior and less favourable conditions than those employed directly by the university. Moreover, we still suffering from injustices and felt that we were being exploited. We continued fighting to improve our working conditions. In 2009, immigration officers raided SOAS and nine of our colleagues were deported due to their immigration status, including pregnant women. These are only a few of the many problems that we faced here at SOAS. These problems could have demoralised us, weakening the campaign, but this was not the case. It actually encouraged us to continue fighting against injustices. I am proud of being with my co-workers fighting for dignity and respect. Since 2011, we began to demand to be brought back in-house. I am proud of leading the Justice for Cleaners Campaign alongside my co-workers to bring to an end the two-tier workforce, to stop being treated differently than those working directly for the university. We aim to stop being outsourced workers. During this time, we have planned demonstration, meetings, forums, referendums and finally we began the legal procedure to go on strike. The ballot result is possibly one of the most important in British trade unionism with 100% voting YES for strike action. We went on strike for 3 days on March 2014 to receive the same equal working conditions as those working directly for the University. Thanks to all this effort, we won! We now enjoy 35 days of holidays, sick pay from day one of employment and 7% pension contribution. This was a major improvement for us. I can proudly say that we fought for better working conditions and we won. I am glad and very grateful for the support of the whole SOAS community, students, staff, and academics. Thanks to this, we are not longer invisible neither vulnerable. We have lost our fear and we know now what we are capable to achieve when we believe in ourselves and get organized. However, La Lucha Continua! The struggle continues! We are still working for a cleaning company, which means that we are still outsourced workers. This means that we are still being treated different than those working directly for the university and this is unacceptable. It has to stop. Hence, Justice For Cleaners SOAS campaign was re-launched for dignity and respect at the end of 2014 and still an ongoing struggle. Do migrants contribute to this society? We certainly do. Migrants bring a lot to the UK society. Our contribution is positive. We do jobs that are important for the running of this country such as contributing with the day to day running of universities; and fighting to improve the standards of living of those working with us, consequently, to the community as a whole. I hope that all workers get organised and fight for equality and justice. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect."

Upon finishing high school, I wanted to have an experience abroad; at that time, in 1991 the then called European Community was offering scholarships for students from EC member states to go and study for their first degree in a different country. I took this opportunity and came to the UK to study archaeology. I continued to study to gain higher university degrees; I was then offered a post-doctoral research job, after obtaining my PhD degree. After that job ended, I applied for university lectureships and was lucky to be offered a one-year temporary post at Glasgow. A year later, I applied for a permanent lectureship at University College London and I was even luckier to be offered it. I have been in London ever since where I teach and research the archaeology of the ancient Mediterranean, a field that attracts students from all over the world; I have trained several students in this subject at all levels as a result. Students recently nominated me for an award in Teaching Excellence sponsored by the Students Union."
212	Costa-Gavras	Greece	France	E	E	close	18117	38959	E	im	male	"I left Greece in the early fifties because I wanted to go to university — at that time in Greece, young students needed to provide certificates showing that their parents were law-abiding citizens in order to be admitted in the university. However, my father had participated in the antiroyalist resistance which halted my plans. I chose France to see whether I could have a shot because it was the only country where I could go to school for free. In my mind back then, Paris was the City of Light as described in books, the city of artwork and paintings. I had pictured Paris as an extraordinary city. But when I arrived at Gare de Lyon that day, it was raining. The buildings were all grey and nobody was waiting for me. My first obsession was to learn the French language — and as quickly as possible. I managed to find accommodation in the university residence, and did what every Parisian student would do: talking about politics, all the time, everywhere. I was registered at the Faculty of Arts, then at the film school. For me, Paris was the symbol of absolute freedom: freedom to read in the libraries or freedom to read while walking around. I learned very quickly what it meant to be a Parisian, and how to live like one. I got to know some Parisian women too! As a Greek man, I felt that I was embraced by friendship and kindness. From time to time, people were a bit curious about me due to my accent. Being open to welcoming the other in the society brings us all one step closer to social and inner peace. France gave me everything; it gave me more than I ever could have imagined. In return, I tried to behave in the most appropriate manner. I started a family, my children and grandchildren are all good people. This is what I gave to France. Today, foreigners are viewed in a more negative way. Ones skin color can provoke some uncomfortable questions and beget feelings that vary from hostility to extreme sympathy, depending on the person. Despite all the difficulties that my country is experiencing currently, Greece has shown a real sense of hospitality. That is what solidarity is all about: respecting the other regardless of who he or she is. People that travel around the world in search of a better life are heroes. We, as Europeans, did colonize many countries but we didnt do what we could have done so that the people in those places would want to stay where they were. It is true that we often quote former Prime Minister Michel Rocard, who once said that France could not take in all the worlds poor, yet we forget what he said afterwards: … but it should faithfully share the burden."
213	Cynthia	Kenya	Rwanda	A	A	close	1879	798	E	im	female	"I'm originally from Mombasa, Kenya. I decided to move to Rwanda to set up an office here. When I first came, I didnt know anyone, which meant starting my new life from scratch; looking for a place to live and making new friends in order to settle in. Luckily I was able to find my way, and before I knew it I was fully focused on what I came to do. Migrating was definitely a challenge, and having to leave behind familiar surroundings, my friends and my family (especially my sister), was difficult. One must really be prepared mentally and emotionally, for this change. However, I can sincerely say it has been worth it. The experience has been very positive; I have made a lot of friends and, following on the principle that tells us home is where the heart is, I am now able to say that I am home. Meeting people with diverse mindsets has helped me to appreciate the ways someone with a different background can enrich your life, and it has enabled me to get in contact with what is beyond our frontiers. Now, when I go back to Kenya, I bring with me lots of positive experiences, lessons learned, and new thoughts that I have gotten from this cultural exchange. It has been a mind-opener. For people that are thinking about migrating (in a regular and safe way), I would tell them to be up for the challenge. It takes a lot out of you when you make the decision to move to another country, so be ready and aware that you never know what might come. You might be surprised by how easy you can adapt, and along the way, you might meet amazing people who will help you find your footing. For the people living in a country that is receiving migrants, just remember to treat people the way youd like to be treated. Today it is them moving to your country, tomorrow it might be you moving to theirs. There is a misperception of migrants that presumes that they go to a country just to take, when the reality is, everybody has something positive to give, and we can always learn from each other."
214	Dahham	Syrian Arab Republic	Belgium	M	E	far	890	45028	H	im	male	Dahham, originally a medical graduate from Deir Alzour, is the first Syrian doctor in Belgium to have his Syrian university degree recognized by the Belgian authorities. The longstanding struggle to have his degree homologated inspired him to help others and consequently, together with his Dutch teacher and other European friends as volunteers, started their own NGO Tandem VZW to help refugees get their qualifications acknowledged by European NGOs and to support in starting a new life in Belgium by, for example, providing specific high-quality volunteering placements and traineeships. When I was planning to leave, my whole family told me not to do so. They tried to discourage me from moving. There is a saying in Arabic that says: Without a home, you have no dignity. At the time, I was overwhelmed with fear of military service and I did not believe it. However, I now fully agree with these words. Without a home country, you truly feel like you are nothing. The main reason behind my leave was to escape the mandatory military service. At the moment everybody is fighting each other in Syria. Consequently they all want to recruit young motivated people to fight with them. I tried to delay my graduation to postpone entry into military service. I tried to help peacebuilding when it was still peaceful, but right now its all about fighting and weapons and thats not something I believe in. Together with some friends, I took the Balkan Route to come here. Last year, it was still quite accessible and organized. At one point, I was certain that we were going to die at the crossing between Turkey and Greece. The boat was starting to sink and we began to throw everything out. Everyone was so afraid, it was a really close call, but we made it. Once we arrived in Lesbos the rest of the trip went smoothly. As an immigrant, Im very grateful for the help I received in Europe. I cant imagine what wouldve happened if there had been nowhere to seek refuge when the new Syrian situation occurred. Even if my country wasnt at war, my dream was always to migrate and practice medicine somewhere else. I always wanted to go to the United States to specialize there, but unfortunately it wasnt possible. In my opinion, young people are always likely to dream of practicing their professions abroad. I think it is really logical to change places from time to time. If migration has any effect, Id say its a positive one, even though you face many obstacles along the way. I believe that migration constitutes an added value for an individual. It brings around a new life, new perspectives and new insights, a new everything. To be honest, I do miss the people back home. I'm more attached to people than to places. Even when looking back at my journey from Syria to Belgium, it was always the people I met that interested me and I still feel connected to those who helped me along the way. There were so many nice volunteers along the road and I remember them more than I remember the places I passed by. Here in Belgium, all is going well for me for now: I got my diploma recognized, I have a safe home, and I started a NGO together with my friends. Looking back on my experience, I still feel positive towards migration, although I wouldve preferred to have migrated under different circumstances. No matter what I do or how I do things, the label of refugee still sticks to me. You cannot break free of this stigma. Im full of hope for the future. This September, Ill be starting my Masters in Molecular Biology at the VUB. Im also volunteering with the EPHA (European Public Health Alliance) where I will assist the policy department on psychological counselling for people coming from war zones and following up on newcomers with non-communicable chronic diseases acquired in their countries of origin. One day, I would eventually like to go back to the country and people I consider to be my home.
215	Damacen	Rwanda	Rwanda	A	A	close	798	798	E	hc	male	I left Rwanda with my family when I was 7 because of the war. My dad was killed during the Genocide. I have spent 12 years in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) living in tents in camps. My brothers found temporary jobs and could buy some food for us. It wasnt a life– it was survival. To be raised by your brothers, who are almost the same age as you– it is hard. I remember sometimes my brother would take me to the Red Cross and they would give us biscuits. This is one of the only good memories I have from there. We would spend days without any food. One of my brothers died from diarrhea there. When we decided to come back, we crossed to Rwanda and were received by the military. They gave us tea and food. I remember I was so hungry and I ate so much that later I had a stomach ache. Back in Rwanda, I met Hitimana, an older mechanic in the neighborhood. I was so fascinated by him and his job. I later had the chance to study mechanics through IOMs 'Sustainable Return & Reintegration Programme' for young returnees like me and I also received a toolbox as part of a start-up business kit. Now, I run my own mechanic shop where I fix motorbikes and sell engines and other parts. Whenever I have any doubts I look to Hitimana for advice. Now he is old and doesnt work, but he is full of knowledge.   The 'Sustainable Return & Reintegration Programme' assisted 77 returnees, most of them living in DRC, with professional training. Damacen is one of the beneficiaries of the project and completed the 6-month training in 2012. Today, Damacen has a wife and 2 kids, and as a successful mechanic and shop owner for the past few years, he is able to take care of his family and community.
216	Damber	Bhutan	Nepal	I	I	close	3218	1135	E	im	female	Damber was born in Bhutan and migrated to Nepal due to the unstable political situation in his country. He has lived in a refugee camp located near Damak municipality, Jhapa in Nepal for 25 years. Though he has been in Nepal for most of his life, he is not considered Nepalese. Nor can he reenter Bhutan. Without a nationality, a government job is also not a possibility. He wants to migrate to the US in search of better opportunities, but hes also hoping he can find a new identity there. He considers America as the land of opportunity, where he can remove the tag of refugee. In the past, he worked as a construction labour, spending long hours enveloped by the cement dust. Then, before he was diagnosed with TB, he was running a readymade cloth store. His income was not very much, but it was just enough for him to sustain himself. Five years ago, Damber also spent time nursing his father, who was suffering from TB at the time. My father had TB and I might have contracted it from him. Congested camp setting, many untested and untreated TB cases in camp, insufficient nutritious diet may have other main causes. When he filled the interest form to migrate to the US, he went through CXR for TB testing. During TB testing, the doctor mentioned that he had a small spot in his lungs, which looked like TB. The doctor requested that he produce sputum for three consecutive days to test what the spot could be. Damber never suspected that he had TB before going to a medical check-up in IOM. He said, When I received the slip to start TB treatment, I was shocked as I had started to think that I may not have TB, because some other fellow who gave sputum sample along with me- they had already started to have TB treatment only within 15 days of sputum sample given. Despite the surprise, he began treatment after the diagnosis. It was a challenge, he said, to live with the disease, even knowing that he was receiving treatment. I was worried, not to take the medicine for 6 month long, but for taking many pills at a time. Having a mask also presented difficulties, and Damber used to feel ashamed wearing a mask when he traveled. He remembers one incident related to the stigma. Once, while I was travelling to Dharan, one of my friends requested I remove my mask. He told me that the hotel owner would not allow [us] to have a meal or reside inside the hotel or would request [us to] bring own utensils to eat a meal. So, every time I used to travel, I used only an ordinary mask rather than a medical (surgical) mask. Before, I used to think TB is a hereditary disease, but after I started TB treatment along with counseling in IOM, my view has been changed. Though he knows treatment will take a long time, Damber feels that it is curable. Now, he also knows that if it is left untreated, it can cause death. And if the treatment is not taken in regularly, it can cause Multi-drug resistance (MDR).  Since the IOM had the facility both to test and to provide treatment, the patient didnt have any issues accessing a treatment facility. Now he feels his health is much better. His appetite has increased and he has gained weight. Damber can now focus on his future and find better opportunities somewhere else. Most importantly, he will eventually find a new identity.   Migrants face higher exposure to TB infection due to overcrowded living conditions. They often do not have access to correct TB related information on prevention, transmission and latent infections due to language barriers as well as cultural beliefs.
217	Dan	Estonia	Estonia	E	E	close	23106	23106	E	hc	male	Dan has a love for Middle Eastern cultures. As a teenager Dan was convinced he wanted to visit Palestine to understand its culture, faith and prevalent conflict.  After finishing his studies he began looking for volunteers with previous experience in Palestine. One village was recommended to me. I contacted the elder of the village, who did not speak English, but referred me to another volunteer. At first I went with a tourist visa. It was difficult to constantly renew my visa, because it required a lot of traveling. All together I was in Palestine little over 3 years. In the spring of 2015 I returned to Estonia, but as a married man. She was doing an internship at a kindergarten next to the school where I was teaching. I taught English to adults and asked if someone from the group could teach me Arabic, she did. At first everyone in the village did not think our relationship was possible. She told her father about me, so I met with her parents, siblings and other relatives. It was challenging as the village was rather conservative, but her family vouched for me. So in the end it all went well. My wife teaches while Im active in several local NGOs. Im a support person to refugees through an NGO called Johannes Mihkelsoni Keskus. Having a direct contact with refugees inevitably destroys the stereotypes media portrays. Media has such a strong influence on how we understand things. In my work I find success stories most uplifting. It brings me so much joy when one of my clients starts speaking Estonian to me. I dont know how or where he has learnt it, but the fact that he can say some basics shows self-motivation and initiation from his side. This type of positive cases are uplifting. I also work with Youth for Understanding student exchange programme. My experience shows that full cultural immersion helps with learning a language – students, who dont know any Estonian when they first come here, speak it at a basic level few months later. I also coordinate Arabic language courses at an NGO called Ethical Links. Our team has a substantial knowledge and experience of Arabic language and cultures. Among many activities we try to offer an alternative to mainstream media. You can read the news all you want, but real encounters are needed to overcome fears and misunderstandings. Last year we imitated an Arabic living room at a local event. We decorated our tent with cushions, carpets, offered Arabic food, taught name writing in Arabic and did henna decorations. We invited people to sit with us and discuss the questions they have. The problem with stereotypes is, they only show one side and amplify it. Fear of the other can be overcome through personal encounter. My hope is Estonia will be a successful state and that common sense will win.
218	Dan	United States	Switzerland	N	E	far	63123	86919	E	im	male	"I left the United States at 27 to go to Ecuador — at the time, I was driven by the need to experience new cultures and see the world. Since then, my travels have taken me to many places including Switzerland, where I now live. When I first arrived in Switzerland I found the people here very reserved and distant. I noticed that people did not look each other in the eyes very often. People would avert their eyes, especially in public places. I felt quite isolated. Living here has afforded me a different perspective; I now appreciate that the Swiss respect people's space and privacy, and this is reflected in their choice not to stare. The Swiss culture values respecting everyones personal space. This realisation was all a part of my cultural education, something that every migrant has to go through. To help others adjust to their new surroundings the way I did when I came here, I co-founded the Refugee Cultural Festival, which focuses on small actions carried out by locals and migrants to encourage intercultural exchange. The principle that underlies both migration and the festival is this: migration means the desire and quite often the need to move to new places. Borders are just something to be crossed to discover new things on the other side of the world and about oneself. The festival is also a means for long-term residents to give newcomers a chance. Even if they are here for a short time, they also have something to contribute. Feeling a part of the community here was a challenge at first, and this was also an opportunity for self discovery. I believe I bring a different perspective and creativity that makes the community richer as all diversity does, and I do my best to pay this forward. Of course I miss a few things about the United States, like the fact that people smile at each other more often. Geneva is happily my home now. It is where I have the people I love and am doing the things I love. Everyone should have the opportunity to experience this if they choose to. I would urge everyone to get out, travel and see the world. Mark Twain spoke of travel as the greatest cure for prejudice and ignorance."

Falling out of legal immigration status after overstaying their visas, he and his family lived in poverty and spent a year in New York City's shelter system. With the support of mentors, he was admitted to a private all-boys' school on Manhattan's Upper West Side, from which he graduated cum laude in 2002. He received his BA in Classics, summa cum laude, from Princeton University where he was chosen salutatorian of the class of 2006. He then received his MPhil in Greek and Roman History from the University of Oxford, and a PhD in Classics from Stanford University. He is currently a Mellon Research Fellow and Lecturer in Classics at Columbia University. In the summer of 2016, he will be returning to Princeton as an assistant professor in Classics. His newly published memoir Undocumented recounts his coming of age as an undocumented immigrant in the many communities he came to call home. He is not an American citizen, and is currently living and working on a work visa, but he is hoping this will change soon as his wife is an American citizen. This experience, as an undocumented person living in another country has been a source of tremendous stress for him: I used to live, in part because of the conditioning of my childhood and adolescence, in this state of expectation that something really bad was about to come our way. When talking about his life as an undocumented person in the US, Dans mother said, I would have liked for the narrative to have been one with less suffering. His migration story and his more recent success as an academic has been covered by major US media outlets including, The New York Times.
220	Daniel	Colombia	Belgium	L	E	far	5333	45028	H	im	male	"I have lived in Bogotá, Colombia almost all my life. Its a city of around 10 million inhabitants and can be very complicated to handle at first, especially for tourists or migrants; its divided socially and Bogotá is huge and expensive. Its said that property could be as expensive as in New York City. On the other hand, its a city that offers everything you could ever need. As a place of convergence for a lot of cultures, especially Latin cultures, it is full of contrast. I didnt leave Colombia because I didnt have everything I needed. I had an excellent life there, but my career and projects demanded that I go out into the world to learn. In Colombia, we lack an international approach to what is going on right now. Many people in Colombia and Latin America believe we have a lot to learn from Europe. I decided to leave at first because I wanted to gain that experience. For me, the people in Brussels are very interesting. The most beautiful thing about the city is how it is constructed by multicultural people and their dynamic. One of the reasons I fell in love with Brussels is that I got to learn more about it through speaking French. Dutch is a very interesting language, but I am too Latin to learn it! I think Belgians are very friendly and also appreciate a relaxed, good life. They enjoy certain things like beer or fries or chocolate, that for some people are just part of their gastronomy. Ive learned how to live that good life in just two years. I do miss the culture, customs and general way of life we have in Bogotá. Sometimes I regret that I am away while there are so many things going on in Colombia regarding the conflict, especially now that we are in the resolution phase. I am still involved even though I live in Brussels. I interact with Colombian political forums here. Each effort that you make is very important. Being outside of the country, our work is perhaps more noticeable than if we were had stayed in Colombia. My attachment to Colombia was very strong before, but now its even stronger. In the end, I do want to return."
221	Daniel	Eritrea	Netherlands	A	E	far	588	53334	H	im	male	Two months before finishing his studies, Daniel had to leave his country, Eritrea, because of the political instability. He managed to collect USD 3,000 to pay a smuggler who promised to take him to Sudan, Libya, and finally Europe. Once in Libya, Daniel had to pay 5,000 dollars more to stay alive and attempt the crossing. My family sold everything to enable me to travel to Europe. Two of my brothers have already left and are living in the UK. After eight hours on a small boat, Daniel and the other migrants were picked up by a rescue ship and brought to Lampedusa. He was then brought to Sicily and to Rome where he spent half a year in a reception centre, sharing a room with eight people. The two and a half euros Daniel received daily he spent on mobile internet to remain in touch with his family. From Italy, Daniel was relocated to the Netherlands. After arrival, he was brought to an asylum seeker centre where he became friends with two other Eritreans. An officer from a municipality not so far away from the asylum seeker centre visited the centre to meet me and my two new friends. He wanted to see whether there is a connection between us and his municipality. We were all very positive, so, in two weeks, my Eritrean friends and I will be housed together in this municipality. Although he could not be relocated to the UK to join his two brothers, Daniel says he is happy. What helps me a lot is the buddy to buddy programme. Daniel meets his buddy weekly to learn the Dutch language and extend his social network. Daniel wants to finish his Dutch language course and then his education. After two or three years, I would like to live in a city where there is a university, such as Nijmegen. My dream is to study computer engineering.

I am currently doing a Master's degree in Public Policy at the Hertie School of Governance and am also working at the Berlin Social Science Center as a research assistant. My whole life, I went to a German school in Mexico. So I have always been in contact with the German culture. I can still recall exactly how pleasantly surprised I was when I arrived in Würzburg. It was such a multicultural city. So, my first impression of Germany was 'Wow' this is a country where people from all over the world arrive and can live together peacefully in one place. My girlfriend is German, we moved to Germany together one and a half years ago. It's not hard for me to travel back and forth between the two countries. I always saw my life as taking place in two countries. When I'm here, in Germany, I feel more like a Mexican. However, in Mexico, I feel a lot more German. My friends in Mexico sometimes tell me I'm too disciplined. It's true, I try to work in a structured way and plan ahead. At the same time, I encourage my friends here in Germany to just have fun once in a while and not to take everything too seriously all of the time. I also hope that that my children grow up in a world with two or more cultures. It's a very expanding experience. What I miss most from Mexico is the food. That's why I try to cook a lot of meals that remind me of home. I just use the things I can buy here and add lime and chili. One of my favorite meals is potato salad with lime juice and parsley. Home, that's Germany and Mexico. Home, that's my home-grown limes.
223	Daniel	Papua New Guinea	Papua New Guinea	I	I	close	2640	2640	E	hc	male	"In a modest apartment in the capital of Papua New Guinea, Daniel and his extended family of 18 are living cautiously. Originally from the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, Daniel, alongside his twin brother and their entire family, enjoyed respectable positions in local governance while making a decent living which was hard to come by in his village. Daniels family was one of the few families in his village that were well educated and literate, something that was always highly enforced by their mother. Daniel and his five year old daughter Shiba came to the capital from their hometown of Bougainville with his extended family where they all had well-paying jobs thanks to their education, which has allowed the family to persevere during hard times. Due to the fact that their village consists of largely illiterate people, rumors began to emerge back in the late 1980s that the family was using sorcery to manipulate their good fortunes. Back in the day, these claims would often get disregarded as nonsense made by those who were either ignorant or jealous of them. The years of accusation of sorcery towards Daniel and his entire family cumulated in 2013. One evening in 2013, an angry mob consisting of four villages worth of people came to his house and brutally murdered his mother and burned their entire home down. Daniel and the rest of his family were able to escape through the help of their in-laws and their villages who intervened before the mob could kill the rest of his family. Since then he and his family were relocated to Port Moresby where they kept a low profile for two years while they battled issues of depression and anxiety. Ultimately, many members of the family were able to find new jobs through their education and are beginning to slowly rebuild their lives. Regardless if it is true or not, once you get branded as a sorcerer, everyone views you as evil and with hatred. Currently his daughter is too young to understand what happened to her grandmother; Daniel insists that one day he will teach her about the misconceptions of sorcery as well as the value of education as it is one of the many tools that have helped his family survive during the whole ordeal."
224	Daniel	Syrian Arab Republic	Belarus	M	E	far	890	6377	H	im	male	Daniel came from Syria to Belarus for university studies in 2006. Daniels father advised him to choose Belarus to continue his education based on his own experience, as he studied at the Agricultural Academy in Gorki in the times of USSR and now has good memories of the country and the quality of education. I didnt think about moving to Belarus and studying at Belarusian National Technical University for a long time and had made my decision very quickly. Only when I was already on the board of the plane did I realize that theres no way back. Upon arrival Daniel got quite a controversial impression of Belarus, as he didn't know Russian, so he had some difficulties dealing with everyday issues. In the beginning, I thought people are not really friendly here but the more I got to know Belarusian people, the more I understood that the first impression was deceitful. I started to feel far more comfortable here, when I finally learned Russian. Daniel has his own small company called 'Dear' specialized in construction and interior design. He also gives lectures on architecture at the Belarusian National Technical University. I want to feel useful for the society I live in. I didn't want to be another Syrian coming here and opening a cafe or restaurant with a national cuisine. I feel pleased when buildings I have designed reflect both European and Syrian cultures. When teaching my students I also tell them about certain technologies that are used in Syria in the field of construction design, which will possibly be reflected in future buildings of my students. In Syria people are more open and know a lot about each other even though theyre not relatives, friends or good acquaintances, in Belarus people are more reluctant to talk a lot about themselves. […] I like when migration processes are natural and when a person coming to a new country gets integrated into the society and at the same time keeps their national identity.
225	Daniel Matul	Guatemala	Costa Rica	L	L	close	4332	12077	E	im	male	I'm Daniel Matul Romero, I'm from Guatemala but I've been living in Costa Rica for 30 years. I left my country because my family was persecuted for its political position and the context of the time was complicated. My life in Costa Rica can be divided into two stages: the first ten years when the constant challenge was to adapt to a new life. The second stage comes when the insertion to the culture and to the country in general becomes easier. You already feel part of here too. My family and I found many opportunities in Costa Rica. People have always been willing to help us, they have always welcomed us with open doors. But maybe this reality is not the same for other families that come from other regions. I dont think we left anything behind. My home could be a Guatemalan territorial space but with windows and doors open to Costa Rica. My home became a place where both visions and cultures can grow and live together. That is the biggest challenge of living in another country: living a little here and a little there. You live the two visions of the world every day, one from the home country and the other one from the host country. Expressions, food, culture, world vision: the two countries intersect in everyday life. For me, poetry was the bridge for both cultures to remain alive. The poetry was always there, to generate simultaneous spaces between Guatemala and Costa Rica. I wrote the book Noche de ronda, a poetry book about migration and feelings, which won the Unique Poetry Prize of the Hispanic-American Floral Games of Quetzaltenango (Guatemala) in 2009.

My grandmother would talk about being hit in school if she spoke Spanish, and so my grandparents didnt want my father to learn Spanish. When I was in high school, we housed Burmese refugees who had been living in a refugee camp in Thailand for 10 years, which opened my eyes to what refugees have to face. In college I saw that a large Somali community was located right next to the university, so I ended up studying Public Health with the intention to work in a refugee center in Somalia, and then go back to serve the Somali community in Minnesota. Then, I moved to New York where I met my husband, who is Italian and was working at the UN headquarters in New York. He was then offered a position in Rome so I quit my job, working in HIV research, and moved here a year and a half ago. I am now a volunteer coordinator at a refugee center in Rome, trying to facilitate integration. I am really lucky because my husband helped me navigate life in Rome. Here I am a person with solid support, adequate resources, a fair knowledge of Italian and I have already a hard time. I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for those arriving, trying to figure things out here.

228	Daouda	Libya	Niger	A	A	close	4243	568	L	im	male	The first IOM charter flight from Tripoli to Niamey touched down in Niger on September 6, 2016, carrying 171 migrants anxious to escape the turmoil of conflict-ridden Libya and eager to reunite with their families. Fifty-six more charter and commercial flights followed over the next four years for over 5,500 Nigerien migrants. Daouda is one of them. I am 46-years-old, but I never set foot in any school, Daouda begins. I had a small business in Niger, but it wasnt going well. I saw friends and neighbors going to Libya to look for work so I went and looked as well. Daouda is one of the 166 Nigerien migrants who returned from Libya on a charter flight organized by IOM in February. I ended up staying for almost four years working in construction, he recounts, waiting to be registered by IOMs team in Niamey after his arrival. As long as there were new buildings to be built, there was work for everyone — the problem was whether you got paid at the end of the day. Once he arrived in Libya, Daouda moved into a neighborhood where many of his compatriots lived, sharing familiar food, speaking the same language and recreating a sense of home. Close to a quarter of the approximately 650,000 migrants currently living in Libya are Nigeriens — the most prevalent migrant nationality (as of December 2019). Like many of his compatriots, Daouda traveled to Libya looking for seasonal work. I could have gone to Europe a long time ago if I wanted to, but the European dream was never my goal. I just wanted to earn enough to provide for my family and go back home, he says. After the conflict broke out in Tripoli and surrounding areas in April 2019, Daoudas wife called relentlessly, begging him to come home. Though he wanted to return, he had no means to do so. On the way to work one day he was picked up off the street and held by armed men. They took everything I had while I was in prison — everything. I worked all this time for nothing. Once released, he went back to his daily construction jobs, hoping he could save enough to pay for his return to Niger. IOMs outreach teams in Libya regularly visit migrant neighborhoods to inform them of the assistance available, including the Voluntary Humanitarian Return (VHR) programme. Several of Daoudas friends used the services and go back to their families in Niger with IOMs support. They got in touch with him, and Daouda was persuaded to return as well. IOMs VHR teams in Libya assist both migrants in detention centers and urban areas. Close to 70 per cent of Nigeriens who availed themselves of the VHR programme were previously living in urban areas in Libya. With the launch of IOMs VHR hotline in 2018, the assistance became even more accessible. Since its launch, close to half of the calls have been placed by Nigeriens wanting to know more. To adapt to current needs, the hotline now also has operators who speak Hausa and Tamashek, both common local languages in Niger. * Call +218 9100 11 491 if you are stranded in Libya * Probably no other IOM mission understands more about organizing charter flights than IOM Libya which has, since November 2015, arranged more than 300 charter and 700 commercial flights for over 50,000 migrants wishing to return home. Migrants from 44 different countries of origin have been assisted with VHR over the years, most of them from Nigeria (15,729), Mali (6,440) and Niger (5,541). In one week alone this February, IOM Libyas 61 VHR staff successfully organized four charter flights to three different countries of origin. The key to understanding the VHR programme is the word coordination. Each seemingly straightforward two-hour flight takes, in fact, days or even weeks of planning with relevant authorities, embassies and consulates, migrant communities, IOM missions in countries of origin, and other partners. The escalating conflict of the past 11 months has made humanitarian work both increasingly complicated and more significant, and added multiple security challenges to the already complex VHR operations. Mitiga International Airport in Tripoli for example has been shelled multiple times, forcing the postponement of charter flights, sometimes more than once. We stay at the airport late into the night to make sure the flights take off safely, says Feisal Muhamud, a Returns Operations Officer with IOM Libya. Other times, the airport has to close down even if our staff already started boarding the migrants. We just sit tight and wait for the airport to reopen. There is only a brief moment of happiness when we see the wheels of the plane leave the ground — and then we start prepping for the next one. All these movements require scaled up operations and reinforced assistance for migrants wishing to return home. Nowadays, although still challenging, charter flights are a regular occurrence for the 16 IOM operations staff managing returns in Niger. Lists are made and WhatsApp groups created to ensure good coordination round the clock. Whenever there is a gap, staff from other units jumps in to assist. There is no programme manager who hasnt at some point distributed food, IOM Niger Operations Officer Esmel Essoh notes. We often end up working nights which requires a lot of flexibility. Stress levels can be high at times, but we do our best to support each other since we are all working towards the same goal — to support migrants in need. As Daoudas plane finally lands in Niamey at 2 am — six hours later than scheduled — a team of IOM medical, protection, data management and operations staff is waiting impatiently for the returnees. Upon arrival, they provide migrants with food, technical and logistical support and medical and psychosocial care if needed. Each migrant also receives pocket money so they can pay for transport to their community of origin. Daouda hasnt seen his wife Rafya and his two children Ibrahim and Mariam for four years. The older one recently started school while little Miriam just turned six. I definitely missed out on many important moments in their lives, but I am determined to make up for it, Daouda says optimistically. My experience in Libya hasnt always been easy, but Im glad I had it. I learned a lot from it and came out a better person. The Voluntary Humanitarian Return (VHR) facilitates orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration management through the development of rights-based and development-focused policies and processes on protection and sustainable reintegration. Daouda, like all migrants returned from Libya via IOMs VHR programme, is eligible for reintegration assistance. Reintegration projects aim to help returnees reach economic self-sufficiency, psychosocial well-being and social stability within their communities. The goal of IOMs Migrant Resource and Response Mechanism (MRRM) in Niger is to provide direct assistance to migrants in transit, carry out activities promoting viable alternatives to migration, inform individuals about safe migration, and encourage activities that ensure migrants can contribute to the economy in their countries of origin.
229	Daria	Russian Federation	United Kingdom	O	E	far	10166	40718	E	im	female	Daria was born in Russia. During her expatriation to Latin America, she met her husband, from Turkey. They looked for a neutral country and decided to settle down in the UK. To be honest I am happy with this change. Im expecting a baby now and my new position as a data analyst allows me to work from home. When you move to a new country, it takes time to have a good life. Everywhere you need to prove yourself. Before coming here, I was afraid of the other peoples reactions because I am Russian. Sometimes, I compare London with my hometown. Moscow is a great city, but its hard to live outside of the capital city. In UK, wherever you go, you see different beauties and also feel safe, which is precious. Ecology is also much better than Russia. For the future, we want to stay here and if it is possible to settle here. We want to raise our child here. Our business and life experience are also very valuable in UK. My husband improves himself and he provides amazing projects for the new technologies in the country. Also, I think I contributed my culture to UK and I have an idea about other cultures. So immigration has mutual benefits. Communicating with people and sharing the lifestyles are really valuable. Personally I feel very lucky because I can bring the best things from my culture, and get the best from UK so it will be a perfect combination. I am feeling good to say I am a migrant.
230	Dario	Luxembourg	Germany	E	E	close	117182	45909	E	im	male	I am a Luxembourgian Italian or Italian Luxembourgian. My parents are Italians, but I grew up in Luxembourg. Now Ive been studying in Berlin for a few years, but interestingly even as somebody how speaks German as a first language, I feel people define me by my name – and thats definitely Italian. Ive always considered myself a foreigner, because at home we spoke Italian. So the language and culture is very close to me – even though Ive never lived in Italy. I barely notice borders, since Im roughly as old as the Schengen-agreement, which allows free movement between most European countries. For example it was perfectly normal for me as a child to go to Germany for shopping. Since I grew up in Luxembourg as the child of immigrants, I speak many languages. My native language I would say is Italian – since thats the language of my parents, my origins. But I also speak German, Luxembourgian and French as native languages, since we used all of them in school and outside. Additionally I learned English and Spanish. To speak so many languages, makes it easy for me to help other people understand different languages and cultures. Thanks to my story I can easily overcome boarders mentally, I guess Im a bit more open. Sometimes there is absurd moments: When I was doing a semester abroad in England and travelled back to Germany, my home for many years, I was constantly asked what I was doing in Germany, since I travelled on my Italian passport. I am going to apply for German citizenship. I want to live here long-term and be able to vote. To me, migration is something positive. It is simply always the search for a better life. Sometimes the impulse is hope, sometimes desperation. Migration is important, whole societies rely on it – even though these countries sometimes dont want to acknowledge it.
231	Darko	Serbia	Hungary	E	E	close	7656	16129	E	im	male	"It felt a bit like coming home. After almost twenty years of moving from one place to the other, Darko has returned to his birthplace, Budapest, to study at the university. Darko has been moving around since he was just eight years old. First with his family to Romania.  He then studied in France, Turkey and Switzerland, and later gained working experience in Poland and Lebanon. Everything that is distinctive about my life is related to moving around. Therefore, I have a very migrant outlook on life. I can live and work wherever I want. I learn new languages easily. Borders are unimportant to me. While returning to Budapest was a deliberate choice due to his admittance into the university, in the 1990s, migrating for him and his family was a necessity. The breakup of Yugoslavia made living in Serbia difficult. His parents had to find jobs abroad; first in Hungary, then in Romania. I feel very privileged I could live abroad. People of my age in Serbia have a rather closed mindset because of the crisis in the nineties They could not leave the country easily. Migration turned me into a completely different person. The constant movement strongly impacted Darkos indentity. Since Darko completed most of his schooling in France, he feels a strong connection to France. However, as a child born to Serbian parents, when people ask Darko where hes from, his answer is Belgrade. Already as a child it was surprisingly obvious to me that I was from Belgrade. Even though I had never actually lived there, I always felt that Belgrade was where I am from. I really loved going back and still have a lot of friends there. Although Darko went to nursery school in Hungary, he forgot most of the language; however, fond memories of growing up in Budapest remain etched in his memory. It was a time of great optimism. The country had just opened up in 1990 and you could see the city changing day after day. Where we lived in Buda there were a lot of parks and playing grounds for children. I had a great time. Returning to Budapest after almost 20 years has been a happy experience for Darko. Although Budapest has changed, the city still feels very familiar to him. But will he stay for long? Budapest is a great city, so if the conditions are right it will do just fine. Just like many other places in the world, I dont see myself living in one place for the rest of my life. I find unity in movement."
232	Darren	Ireland	Germany	E	E	close	86251	45909	E	im	male	I am from Ireland, studied history in Dublin. After I started my PhD in England, I applied for a scholarship. The German Academic Exchange Service granted it to me, and so I came to Germany in 2012. I am a historian and study German history. I think it is good, that Im here, since Im bringing an outsiders perspective to German history. The beginning was difficult. I did not speak the language well. My girlfriend is German and I wanted to buy her a birthday card. I found a very nice one, with a pretty flower on it. I didnt know that it was a condolence card. So when my girlfriend opened the card in front of all her friends, they had a good laugh. I had not anticipated that Germans would be so different from Irish and English people. The cultural differences are quite big and it took me a while to get used to them. For example, when I visited people in the beginning, I always left my shoes on. That is a big No-Go here. It was weird. Not wrong, but very different. Home, I spoke to many people, what does it mean – particularly the German word Heimat. Its a difficult question. Maybe memories, childhood, problems, but all in all satisfaction. I am a migrant, but I dont feel that way. Ireland will always be my home of course. Im living here now, and I dont know if I will ever live in Ireland again, but it will always be my home.
233	Darren	United Kingdom	Belarus	E	E	close	40718	6377	L	im	male	I came to Belarus at the end of September last year. Why? My wife is Belarusian and we came here for vacation and I liked it that much we decided to stay. Weve now set up a business here doing SEO and Online Marketing. It goes without saying that we are now the Coolest Company in Minsk when searched on Google. I just want to use my professional experience that I gained working for a former Google UK director, to help bring Belarus and Minsk to a new level in terms of doing business online internationally, as theres definitely a gap in the market. I've moved to new places 8 times. I lived in Canada, Malta, US, Italy, Canary Islands, Cyprus and now, Im here, in Belarus. Moving to a new country is never stressful for me, as it means new people, new skills, and new experience. Well, I had a negative experience when I was in Italy 2014. I was involved in a motorbike accident after a driver hit me and didn't stop. I briefly died, lost my leg and gained serious injuries, including broken back, 7 broken ribs, broken collarbone, collapsed lung and I was in a coma for 8 days. So, now, Im living my second life and trying to enjoy what God has given me! What about my Belarusian experience? I can say, it is very clean, probably the cleanest place I've ever been and I feel safe here. You could walk here with a rucksack full of money and feel confident that nothing will happen to you. In general, its a comfortable country to live in. The only English thing I really miss here is bacon and cheese. Thats what I bring from England every time I go there. However, theres another problem – absence of a barrier-free environment. Thats what I realised before I got my artificial leg. So, Im thinking now to create and start a charity similar to the one Ive founded in UK – Help an Amputee. This is a charity aimed to help others who have suffered the loss of a limb, and at the moment Im doing fundraising to launch the helpline for amputees and their family members. Im going also to take part in the Minsk Half Marathon to raise money and use them for charity here, in Belarus.
234	David	South Sudan	Ethiopia	A	A	close	1421	840	E	im	male	David is from Malakal in South Sudan, which has been the scene of horrendous fighting. He now works as a shelter supervisor for IOM inside Jewi camp. He mobilizes camp residents to work on their own shelters, arranges training for fellow refugees and oversees people receiving their payment for the work they do on the shelters. My dream one day is to get a scholarship somewhere to continue my studies. I know in the past refugees got scholarships so Im hoping one day I can too. That would really be the best thing for me. For now, Im making the most of opportunities inside the camp and working with IOM has been really good. We are a team and I like helping the community here build their houses. You can see for yourself that when we arrange the payments for people, it is well organized.
235	David	United Kingdom	Portugal	E	E	close	40718	22413	E	im	male	Olá! Im Dave, an artist and arts coordinator from London now living in Lisbon. My mission in life is to convince everyone that we are ALL artists. I first arrived in Portugal for a holiday in 1983. It seemed very chaotic, workers and friends arrived would arrive late yet no one seemed stressed. Every clock showed a different time. There was an abundance of street cafes and down cobbled streets. You could find quite a few old time taverns playing Fado, the melancholic Portuguese music. My favorite part of Lisbon is Mouraria, the second oldest district in the city Centre. Here there is a mixture of local Lisbon-etas, people from Portugal's former colonies such as Mozambique, Angola, Cape Verde, Macau plus Chinese people and Romanians. I am disappointed by how people from different ethnic groups seem to have less job opportunities than the Portuguese but love how there is a lot of socializing within the local communities themselves. I'm a self-taught artist and I sell my own drawings, paintings and a book of my prose/poems in bars, cafes and street markets. I make just enough to get some tasty Portuguese stew in many of the local cafes. Since the year 2000 I have coordinated drawing, painting and creative writing workshops. In doing so I learned that the Portuguese culture is very moderate and timid, full of potential artists simply too shy to even try. Art courses in Portugal are usually too expensive for those on an average Portuguese wage. Therefore I teamed up with other community arts coordinators and created the group: CHOCA – Chill Out Community Arts. CHOCA runs art activities for all levels. People can pay for their lessons by making donations: either offering services or paying with objects. Over the years CHOCA has run arts workshops in schools, art clubs, centers for senior citizens, clubs for the unemployed, festivals and more. In June 2017, CHOCA opened a community arts house in Lisbon for the general public to do art in a relaxed homely atmosphere of a residential apartment open to the public. There is an arts activity every day and one or two activities on the weekend. I think Portugal is still a very relaxed moderate place, but I also feel it is becoming more confident and positive. Could it be that CHOCAs help for people to do art has played a part in this?
236	David	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	male	I have been overjoyed at being able to call the United Kingdom home over the last 15 years. As a Professor of International Security at the University of Bath, I have had the opportunity to teach and supervise thousands of British, European and International students. I have also worked with the UK government through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ministry of Defence, and the UK Government. I am pleased to have received citizenship in 2010 and been able to benefit from a welcoming community, a fantastic national health service and paying my full taxes to the British state.
237	Debadutta	India	United Kingdom	I	E	far	1931	40718	H	im	male	I am from Orissa (Odisha) in eastern India where I studied engineering and biotechnology at Biju Pattanaik University of Technology. I worked as a brewer for the Indian arm of a multinational brewing company. In 2009 I moved to the UK to study MSc Food Science at the University of Leeds. During this time I found the UK to be extremely welcoming and I could tell that it was a place where anyone willing to work hard can be successful. I had considered moving to other countries such as the USA, Australia and Spain but ultimately it was the UK that attracted me. After graduating I joined a UK food manufacturer in a technical and compliance role. Several years later I am now in a senior technical position at a UK-based luxury confectionery manufacturer which exports worldwide. By applying my skills and expertise I ensure that UK food manufacturers and processors remain compliant with the ever changing and challenging food safety regulations and continue to deliver safe food of good quality. Since coming to the UK I have witnessed major changes in the food industry and there have been many challenges, media coverage of which has affected public confidence. My role allows me to directly influence the level of trust placed in the industry and ensure that going forward the UK food industry is perceived as a role model for other countries. I have visited schools and colleges to deliver workshops aimed at encouraging young people to consider a career in the UK food industry.
238	Delphine	Cote d'Ivoire	Mauritania	A	A	close	2318	1702	E	im	female	The war has completely changed my life. I studied eleven years at the School of Dance and Cultural Exchange in Ivory Coast. I graduated with merits and began working in a big dance company. We toured in so many countries.I had a good life. But when the second Ivorian civil war began, we had no choice but to leave. People do not decide to become a refugee. Its the context that brings you there. Life in a camp is not an easy life. There are illnesses, prostitution, kids cannot go to school and its hard to find a job. Then I heard that the Mauritanian currency, the ouguiya, is much stronger than the CFA. I wanted to find a job and earn some money to start building up my life again, so I left the refugee camp in Ghana, without really knowing what to expect. I could not afford a plane ticket, so I travelled to Mauritania by car but I liked it. I saw so many beautiful landscapes. What surprised me the most the day I arrived was the cold. I was expecting desert, camels and a strong sun, instead I was shivering as if I was in Paris. Fortunately in Nouakchott there is an Ivorian community, so they gave me some warm clothes and some blankets for the night. I was so surprised when I saw all the big buildings here, the big cars and people living in an easy way. This country is so different from Ivory Coast. My country is secular while Mauritania is Muslim, so many things are forbidden, there are no clubs, no bars, but … I like it. Each country has its culture and rules, I like the quietness here, the silence. I met Mr Babi, the director of the CIMAN institute, a music conservatory and he welcomed me as a father. He told me I could collaborate with them and start giving dance classes. I am a migrant now. It is not going to be easy, but I am a strong woman. My children have to go back to school, we need a new house and a new life. What I would like is to ask our political leaders to think of the poor, to stop useless conflicts. Destroying takes less than a minute but rebuilding takes an entire lifetime.
239	Deng	South Sudan	Italy	A	E	far	1421	31238	H	im	male	I have been living in Italy for 25 years now and perfectly remember the first day I landed in Rome. At that time, my country was in the midst of war and South Sudan was yet to be declared an independent state. Living as a refugee in Italy was easier back in the 90s than it is today. Things were extremely different. There were just a few refugees and Italians were very welcoming, especially towards migrants like me, who were eager to start working in their host country. I started out picking tomatoes and, then, as I am fluent in Arabic, I became an interpreter and worked for many international organizations that provided assistance to migrants. Being a refugee in Italy can be very challenging. I was going to small towns and villages where refugees were very isolated. Some of them would refuse to go to the hospital even if they were extremely sick and in bad shape because they were afraid of the possible legal consequences. I consider myself lucky. I have a job, I speak Italian, and my life is in Italy. But of course, I also faced a few funny situations: I was in line at the main police station in Rome for the renewal of my residence permit. One policeman called my name out loud: Deng! So I stood up and approached him, he looked at me with a puzzled expression. Are you Deng? I nodded, and he checked my documents anyway to verify I was telling the truth. Then he said I expected you to be Chinese! And yet, my name is a typical tribal South Sudanese name! Whenever I think about it I cant help but chuckle.
240	Deng	Sudan	United States	A	N	far	1415	63123	H	im	male	I was one of the children known as the 'Lost Boys of Sudan' that got resettled in the United States, said Deng who came to the United States in 2001 through the United States Resettlement Admission Program. The Lost Boys of Sudan was the name given to a group of over 20,000 children who were displaced and/or orphaned during the Second Sudanese Civil War in the 1980s. Deng lived in the Kakuma refugee camp in Northern Kenya for about a decade. It was a very dramatic experience to be uprooted from a refugee camp to the United States. Everything was so overwhelming: culture, technology, education, lifestyle, and climate. When I landed in Phoenix, Arizona, as I looked around, I saw people, I saw buildings, I was close to the road and there were cars passing. It was just so remarkable. I felt like I had just landed from Mars. He still has vivid memories of his life in the refugee camp. I was illiterate until the age of 14. I never went to school until I got displaced. In South Sudan I was taking care of goats and cattle. In the camp, we could not wait for classrooms to be built, so we sat down under trees, and used the sandy soil for notebooks, our fingers for pencils and our feet as erasers. When he arrived in the United States, Deng wanted to get an education. I went to Arizona State University and was admitted in the Liberal Arts to study Political Science with a minor in Economics. Thanks to my hard work, I was able to graduate in three years while working full time. After graduating from Arizona State University, Deng was admitted to a two-year MBA program at George Washington University that he successfully completed. He started working with the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank for about a year. He eventually decided to resume his education and was selected as one of the Dubin Fellows at the Harvard Center for Public Leadership. I was lucky to get a scholarship with the Center for Public Leadership. They sponsored me for the entire two years. These privileges are things that I take seriously because not all of those who left the village in 1987 survived. But I am one of them.
241	Denijen	Serbia	Germany	E	E	close	7656	45909	H	im	male	I entered Germany illegally at the age of 18. I fled because of the war. I already had the medical examination and it was only a question of when I would be drafted by the military. I came here in order to escape all that. Overall, I didn't feel warmly received by society, but people my age did welcome me quickly. At the beginning, I was totally confused and lost in Germany, because I was here without my circle of friends and without knowing the language. I had to take action very quickly, I could not just let myself go and complain. I learned the language quickly, took pains with my studies and soon shot my first short film. I was flexible and spontaneous, had a lot of endurance and optimism. And I was convinced that I would be able to contribute something here as an artist. For me, what is lacking here is the flexibility and relaxed attitude of the people. I did notice that everything is very well organized, that people take great pains with everything and are very capable. But they are also very afraid. I came from a war-torn country with a lot of problems and crises, but I felt like people took much more pleasure in life there. I am completely lost between two worlds. The more time passes, the more I feel like I am not at home here nor in Serbia where I come from. It was a liberating feeling for me. I can just as easily imagine moving to another country with my family. Somehow I lost my home country, but I do not see that as a loss, more as a relief. When I am somewhere and I feel good with the people I deal with, I feel at home. And that could be anywhere.
242	Denise	Australia	Cambodia	O	I	far	55823	1513	L	im	female	I never think of myself of a migrant, I think of myself as Sister Denise, but indeed I am a migrant. I have been living in Cambodia for more than 30 years working with refugees as well as Cambodians injured by landmines and cluster bombs. I first came to Cambodia after having worked in refugee camps across the border in Thailand. Our organization realized that we needed to do more, especially for the Cambodians who were displaced in Cambodia after the war.  And then I just enjoyed it so much and loved the Cambodian people that I stayed on, hoping Im doing something useful but also receiving much more from the people than Im giving. In the 21st century, I really agonize about the need for protection for all sorts of people: refugees and asylum seekers…but also for the protection of people who really do flee abject poverty. People say oh, economic migrants, but really theyre people fleeing from an absolutely impossible life. So I think one of the big issues we have to pursue – and use all the academics and the universities and the practitioners and the people and the people called migrants themselves – to think: what is the best means of protection for people in this century? Even people fleeing environmental degradation, who are they? Theyre persecuted by something: by the way that other people have exploited the earth. For me, empathy is the first step towards building a community that supports and accepts migrants and refugees. My advice to others:  Please give everybody a fair go. Imagine yourself on one of the boats that flee and your child being the one thats tipped over and drowned, and what would be your response to that? And dont think of people who are fleeing either for work, or for safety or from persecution, dont think of them as a generic brand of people, but try to see the face and meet the person in each one.
243	Denise	Rwanda	Switzerland	A	E	far	798	86919	H	im	female	I'm originally from Rwanda and I now live in Switzerland, where I work for an international NGO that aims to save lives and improve health conditions, especially among women and children. Before this I lived in Norway, where my family fled during the civil war in Rwanda. Defining my identity was a struggle growing up. People are so eager to label you as one thing or another. I now know that it's not only ok, but it's actually great to have multiple labels - you don't have to choose one over the other! Being a migrant does not mean being either/or - it's about being both/and. Being a migrant also means being able to share different points of view with the people we meet and interact with. My first impressions on arrival in Norway were that it was cold - I guess that's what everybody thinks when they go to Norway! But during my time there, I came to learn that Norwegians are some of the warmest people I know, with the biggest hearts. There are of course several things that I miss about my country: no one laughs like we do in Africa! But home is no longer a physical place for me, it is a feeling — one that can be found wherever there is love.
244	Dennis	Honduras	Costa Rica	L	L	close	2406	12077	H	im	male	"'Unfortunately in Honduras, where I come from, people are killed every day and many of these murders are part of a wave of persecution and hate crimes against sexual diversity. I started my activism when I was 13 after experiencing discrimination and violence. I started working on a human rights program after witnessing the murder of one of my colleagues. As I could testify against those involved in this crime, my life was in danger and I received several threats. For these reasons, I migrated to San José, Costa Rica in 2012 and applied for asylum based on sexual orientation. After five months,Costa Rica made me the first case of granting refugee status based on sexual orientation. My case has been emblematic and today many other sexual diversity leaders persecuted in Central America can be protected in this country. I come from a family of many values. I am the youngest son of my parents and I was always pampered by my sisters. Being gay had an impact on the love that some members of my family gave me, but somehow they all love me. It was therefore difficult to accept that I had to leave Honduras and look for another country to live in to escape the death threats. I left home and my mother behind. Knowing that she is worried is the hardest things I have to deal with. Once in Costa Rica, I created a newsletter and realized that I could do a lot though online media. In 2013, I met another group of refugees and founded Comunidad Casabierta. We are a team, a community, a family, and a space for human rights activists and human rights defenders living in persecution. We want to be a safe and creative space so that persecution do not impact too much our lives. Our activism is a 'virtual' activism. I was lucky to be able to exchange experiences with other activists worldwide. I visited the Netherlands in 2014 to a program on LGBT rights; I went to Mexico to participate in a training with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as well as in a LGBTI Political Leadership meeting held in the Dominican Republic. I would like humanity to be truly democratic for LGBTI population. LGBT people should have access to all human rights in our countries. My dream is to return to my country and live in peace. I wish my country had openly gay, lesbian or trans public officials. But most importantly, I would like to offer a shelter to all persecuted LGBT leaders, who are rejected by their families."
245	Diana	Georgia	Greece	I	E	far	3984	18117	E	im	female	As a 24-year-old archeologist, spending 10 months in Athens was a dream come true. I met a lot of people while in Athens and visited all the famous museums and ancient monuments that this historic city has to offer. I was attracted to Greek culture and history like a magnet, I just couldnt get enough. The most valuable experience I gained, however, was through a Greek acquaintance who later became a very close friend of mine. He taught me how to print postcards and create handmade souvenirs, frames and diaries showcasing Greek history and mythology. We were very creative with our work and sold this memorabilia to tourists. Once I was confident in my abilities, I decided to take my newly acquired skills back to my hometown of Tbilisi, Georgia. I wanted to return home and produce the same material, but with Georgian traditions. I hope to create a cultural dialogue between Athens and Tbilisi by selling similar artifacts that tell different stories. I found the voluntary return programme run by IOM, the UN Migration Agency, to be the best solution for returning home. Thanks to the reintegration assistance provided by the programme, I will receive all the necessary equipment I need to build my workshop. This will allow me to create and sell original, handmade souvenirs that reflect Georgian tradition and culture. I love my home country and I am extremely excited to share its traditions and history with the world.
246	Diana	Greece	Ukraine	E	E	close	18117	3557	L	im	female	My parents moved to Ukraine when I was a child because life had become difficult in Greece. At first it was not easy for us to integrate because of the cultural difference but when I look back on my childhood, I can say that I enjoyed growing up in Ukraine: it is a beautiful and pleasant country. Growing up, I was dreaming of going back to Greece but now that I am an adult, I have realized that I would not want to live there anymore. I have always thought that the grass was greener there but I was wrong. The grass in Ukraine is just as green and I am glad I live here. Ukraine is my home now. I made close friends, I have a good relationship with my neighbours, and I had the opportunity to study in a great university. However, it was not always easy to integrate here because people from Eastern countries are often discriminated against. For example, when I was looking for a place to rent, I faced refusals because of my nationality. Similarly, on many occasions, I heard Ukrainian people call Greeks thieves or hooligans. Stereotyping is quite common here unfortunately. But Im grateful for having been raised here because it made me who I am. I feel half Greek half Ukrainian. My identity is based on a mixture of two cultures.
247	Diana	Nigeria	Germany	A	E	far	2085	45909	H	im	female	"I have Croatian, Nigerian and Jamaican heritage but I grew up in Cremona, in Northern Italy, which was not an easy place to spend my childhood and adolescence. In the 1980s, I was the second mixed-race child born and raised in that city. Because of this there werent any role models for me to look up to as a teenager and young woman. The encounter between African and European culture plays a big role in my art; this is why I mostly use a black and white color spectrum and make references to mixed historical figures, like African-Italian partisans during WWII. I want to shed light on these people, as my contribution to people like me, who always looked for representation and role models but could not find any. Its a way to give back to the African-Italian community that feels voiceless and unrepresented. While growing up, I felt pressured to define myself either as exclusively African or Italian, and I did not want to choose one culture over another. Sometimes when I am in Italy, locals make comments about my Italian proficiency. You speak Italian so well! to which I used to reply, in a more tongue-in-cheek tone, Well, you too! Funny enough, they are the ones who get the most offended! I have been living in Germany for eight years now, first in Hannover and then in Berlin. Here in the capital, artists are given a lot of space and support to express themselves. The problems that I encounter here revolve around my professional goals as an artist - such as earning enough to invest in installation and exhibits - not my ethnicity. Onajite is my Nigerian name which means 'this is enough.' And yet, everything I have experienced so far does not seem to be enough! I cant see myself staying in Europe for long. I am seriously considering moving to Lagos, Nigeria, where my father is from, for some time. I would like to explore my origins and expand my knowledge. There is a set of ancient Nigerian ideograms that, back in the day, was only passed down from one generation of shamans to another and that represented a secret language forbidden to women. As a female African-Italian artist, I decided to include them in my artwork by blending Nigerian themes with Western aesthetics and styles. I would like to create a sort of cultural bridge between Italy, Germany and Nigeria and put these two worlds in contact. Being a woman and an artist with an African background makes me believe that I have to show the complexity and the beauty of diversity."
248	Diego	Guatemala	Switzerland	L	E	far	4332	86919	H	im	male	When I arrived to Geneva to work as a journalist, I got the chance to know a lot of people from all over the world, which is complicated to do in Guatemala. I like the openness that these countries give to anyone, and how they enable you to assume the characteristics of the country and integrate into their society. I miss my family and my friends. The distance is difficult because it doesnt let you be with the people that you grew up with. I also miss the warmth of the people, which is a very valuable cultural factor in Guatemala. Im not very nostalgic of the food, but I do miss the Guatemalan geography because you were able to get to the beach or the mountains in very little time. I grew up with music being a centre point of my life, and in Switzerland it is very difficult to continue with it because, if you want to be part of the music scene, you have to bear a long process. Nevertheless, Geneva has allowed me to be enriched with the types of concerts and shows that the country has. This is very important as this opportunity has enhanced me. For eight years, Diego has worked as a link between Switzerland and the Guatemalan Civil Society representatives: I think that one of the areas that Ive developed as a journalist is to provide a platform for Human Rights Defenders that come from Guatemala to the UN in order to denounce human rights violations. This is a personal commitment that I made to myself and that Ive tried to keep, as Im the only active Guatemalan journalist at the UN in Geneva. His work has allowed him to accompany important human rights violations claims regarding the insecurity that Human Rights NGO workers and indigenous people have, crimes against women and the assassination of journalists, among others, to the UN Council.
249	Diego	Chile	Estonia	L	E	far	13232	23106	E	im	male	My first knowledge of Estonia was from my father. When the Berlin Wall fell, he came to me and said, Look these are three small countries – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania that got independent from the Soviet Union. They are very small. I was born in Chile and worked as a graphic designer in a wine company for 12 years. Chile is diverse and so are its people. I am a big fan of metal music and Finnish bands. Because of this, I was very interested in this part of the world. In 2010 my friend and I visited Finland for a concert, we decided to visit Estonia as well. While in Estonia, it was completely by chance that I met Eliisa. We fell in love very fast and that changed my plans for the future. Im the kind of person that doesnt want to regret the decisions not taken, Ive always made prompt decisions. I thought if this is the chance to meet someone really wonderful as she seems to be, then lets give it a try. We have nothing to lose. I offered her to move to Chile, but it took me six months to just convince her to visit me there. In 2012 I moved to Estonia. We had a beautiful wedding. I was completely welcomed by Eliisas family and their circles. Her mother, sisters and all the family were very glad I was here. Then I immediately found a job at an advertising agency. My first impression was that there was no communication, gradually all conversations changed to Estonian and I wasnt included. This was nothing like the Chilean culture of nonstop socializing every day. Before moving here I had never experienced isolation. After working at different agencies, I wanted to freelance. But if you dont have contacts and dont manage the language, what to do? I started a business in an outdoor food tricycle café located at a park close to a school and office buildings. At the park, Ive had a lot of contact with locals and have many interesting stories to tell. Since I speak with all of my clients Ive discovered that some are very prejudiced. The question people ask all the time is – where do you come from. Some quickly assume Im from Pakistan or Iraq. I guess this is the influence of mass media, which greatly concentrates on refugees, that makes people have a hard time imagining someone could come from a different place with a different reason. I dont have any problem to be Indian or Pakistani, but Im not from there. When people find out Im from Chile, the prejudice is much lower.
250	Diego	Italy	Germany	E	E	close	31238	45909	E	im	male	Diego left Italy and came to Germany full of love for his new German girlfriend and ready to start his PhD. Regrettably, love and the studies didnt work out well for him, but he decided to stay anyway. In Germany the opportunities for work and quality of life are better than in Italy. Of course, I do miss the food and the sun in my country, but working 12 hours per day, always threatened with unemployment … it was not worth it. When I arrived, I had some free time and I wanted to help people. When I realized I was an economical migrant, I thought it was the category of migrants that some locals did not wish to see here, especially if these migrants come from the other side of the Mediterranean. I feel lucky I was born on this side of the World. I can go everywhere I want and I find it deeply unfair that we can move freely and others cant. I am now working as a volunteer to help migrants integrate within the German society, thanks to the Initiative Neue Nachbarschaft Moabit (New Neighbourhood in Moabit, Berlin.) I just started to learn Arabic. I am fascinated by the language and I am looking forward to learning the languages of the people I am working with. Since I became one myself, I have become more sensitive to the migrants cause. For example, last Christmas, I was sitting at the dinner table with my family when my grandmother started to say some racist things about migrants. I started waving my arms at the other side of the table to stop her and said: Hey, grandma, I am a migrant!
251	Dilu & Anthon	Sri Lanka	Jordan	I	M	far	3768	4283	E	im	n	"Anthon decided to leave his country, Sri Lanka and move to Jordan almost 20 years ago. Despite the ongoing war in his country, he decided to move for economical reasons. His wife, decided to move to Jordan a few years later, for love. I wanted to earn some money and be able to support my family. When I came here, I was so young and didnt know anything about Jordan, but my mother was working here and she asked me to come and help her. I immediately loved Jordan because I felt I could try to build something here. After three years, my wife joined me on this adventure. We have four children who were born in Amman. We have sent three of them back to Sri Lanka to study. Now, Im planning to go back to Sri Lanka, when my last, finishes school. We speak for one or two hours with them every day. Our family asked us to come back and take care of the children, but they are studying and we need to send them money. We are old now, we will not find a job in Sri Lanka. Memories seem to fill in the air. Dilu adds: I arrived here at a very young age . I even learnt how to cook here and it is my husband who taught me how to cook rice! I cook Arabic food because I dont know how to cook Sri Lankan dishes.Anyways, Sri Lankan food has a lot of curry, and I dont like it. They made their lives in Jordan; they feel torn between this life they are used to and which allows them to support their family back in Sri Lanka and their country they've been visiting once per year. Even though, lately, the situation in Syria has made it harder to make a living in Jordan, Anthon would like to stay whereas Dilu dreams of moving back there. Anthon adds: I have had a good experience with Jordanian people, they are nice people. I have a lot of Jordanian friends. Before, the cost of living was very cheap, and the life was easy, but since the Syrian war the life is difficult. I would like my sons to go to another country after their studies. They want to go to America, but it is very difficult for the moment. I always tell them to first come to the Middle East and then, when they have enough money, theyll travel to America if they want!"
252	Dina	Georgia	Georgia	I	I	close	3984	3984	E	hc	female	"My name is Dina and I come from Georgia. I first came to Greece in 2004. My sister-in-law had come to Greece several years ago and she is still living and working legally in Chania, on the island of Crete. Back to my country, I was working as an economist, but my company went bankrupt and I found myself unemployed, together with another 2,000 people. I was looking for months to get a job, while my husband who was working as a professor at a university stopped getting paid, as well. At the same time, we had three sons to raise. The older one, was studying at the university. We could not afford paying for his studies. There was no income for the family. Although he was a good student and the university helped us a lot, he could no longer continue his studies there. That was the moment when I decided to leave my country and look for a job somewhere else. My husband was against my decision, but I had no alternative. My childrens future was a priority for me. I sought information related to Greece with the help of my sister in law and I decided to start this journey hoping for a better future. I travelled as a tourist by bus from Georgia to Athens and from there by ferry to Chania. Irregular travelling was not my option. The first months were difficult, I felt sick, I went to doctors and they told me that my health situation was fragile due to psychological reasons. Everyone urged me to go back home, but there was no way back for me. I could not give up and I did not give up. All these years I was working as a domestic servant. I was even doing two jobs in parallel. From morning till noon, I was going to a house helping mainly with the households and after finishing with that, I was working till night in another house. I was earning good money, enough to live in Greece and to send to my family back in Georgia, as well. I want to thank all the families who have trusted me; who have offered me work and who have treated me in a so nice way. I will never forget the first family I worked for, which had an 8-year-old son. When he was learning the Greek alphabet, I was sitting next to him to learn the language, and this is how I learnt Greek. Soon I started to read stories and fairy tales to him. I did not expect from them to be so nice. I do not know how to thank them. Greece is now a part of me. I found out about AVRR from a friend of mine, who returned to Georgia two months ago. She was very pleased with IOM services. The die had been cast. I wanted to go back to my children; I wanted to meet my grandchildren. I contacted the AVRR Information Officer who operates in Crete for more information related to the programme and he assisted me with the procedures I should follow. Consequently, I visited IOM premises in Athens where I was provided with a reintegration counseling session discussing my options. The same week, after getting my air ticket and the cash assistance, I got informed that upon my return to my country, I would be benefited with the in-kind reintegration assistance, as well. I returned to Georgia while in less than a month my small business had been set up. I am happy and satisfied since all of us have found our way. One of my sons is a lawyer, the other one became an accountant and the third one an economist. And I…returned to them, running my own small business."
253	Divya	India	Italy	I	E	far	1931	31238	H	im	female	I have been living in Milan for more than 5 years, which is my first experience outside India. I actually never planned to leave my country in the first place, but I honestly feel at home now in Milan. Milan is more peaceful, while India is chaotic and even suffocating at times. It started while I was studying for my second year of fashion design at university in New Delhi. Back in my school days I was also a part-time model, but I was mostly focusing on fashion design. I accidentally enrolled in a competition – which I thought was a fashion competition – but that was instead a beauty pageant. I was selected in the auditions and I was part of this Miss Universe India pageant, which was hosted by the ex-Miss Universe, an Indian woman, who I looked up to in India for her entrepreneurial skills. Then I found out there was a scholarship linked to the competition from a fashion institute in Milan. It sounded so surreal, but it was an opportunity I couldnt miss. I wanted the scholarship, and soon after I found out I got it!  My life completely changed after that. I was on a really tight budget, didnt speak the language, plus finding accommodation was a big issue. Just after three days in Milan, I wanted to go back to India! The first odd cultural feature I noticed about Milan was that, although being a fashion capital and a metropolis, most restaurants would be closed at 3 PM. At the beginning, it was tough to adjust to this new cultural routine and lifestyle but I was doing well in school. Eventually I found a stable job as a designer for a year and a half. I would say that my journey was positive. When I talk to Indian peers who have also moved to Milan, I see a lot of disappointment and loneliness. But I think its because they were expecting the same level of comfort that they were used to at home. I am taking it in a different way: I will always be a foreigner here and if I dont accept it, I will never be happy. So I adapted myself, and now I feel in the middle– both a local and a migrant.
254	Djamila	Chad	Nigeria	A	A	close	679	2085	E	im	female	"A DREAM TO WORK AS A HUMANITARIAN Djamilla is a resilient and dedicated Chadian working with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as a part of the response to the Maiduguri crisis in Nigeria. A veterinarian by training, she always had the hope of working in the humanitarian world. Yet, when she was rejected for a job with a UN agency due to her lack of English, she decided to go to Accra to learn the language. After some time in Ghana, she discovered a position working with the resettlement program for refugees in Chad, financed by the United States and managed by IOM Ghana. Given that she spoke French, Sudanese Arabic, and now English, something triggered in her mind: this post is for me!. After applying, and completing an interview in English and French, she managed to obtain her first job with IOM in Chad as an Operations Assistant. On the way to commence the new position, she was confronted with her first test. After missing her scheduled bus for Goré, she found a place on another, full of travelers where she had no choice but to sit in the back. A few hours later, she was awakened by the sound of cries and flames; the bus had an accident that killed 12 people; in which her life was saved due to her position in the back. Wounded, traumatized and lost, but determined, she continued on her path, and reported without delay to her first day. After 8 years of aiding returnees, displaced persons, and other migrants in various situations with passion and altruism, she finally landed an international position in Maiduguri where she has been working for the past two years as a Project Manager for the distribution of non-food items (NFI) and Area Coordinator for Bama, in the state of Borno. When asked why she agreed to migrate for work, especially in such a challenging context, she responds I always dreamed of working in the humanitarian world, to serve vulnerable people and the mandate of IOM has always fascinated me. For Djamilla, to pursue an international career is certainly a feat, but leaving her country to help those in need is what she is proud of and her greatest achievement. To work away from family, in a context with great instability, where we always have our hands on our hearts she says, is not easy but her work is not finished I still have more to do for these people"
255	Djibril	Senegal	France	A	E	far	1458	38959	H	im	male	"Djibril, a Senegalese-born baker, is an example of success in France. Since 2004 he is the manager of an artisan bakery in Paris, where he started working as an apprentice 22 years ago. He comes from a family of bakers from father to son. Ive been immersed in this atmosphere since I was a young kid. I saw my father prepare the bread dough everyday while I was playing in his workplace. Thats why it seemed natural to me to become a baker. In 2010 and 2015, he won the prize awarded to the best artisan baker in Paris, a distinction that many envy. To bake a good baguette, patience and rigour are necessary. I feel challenged every day. What I like in bread making is that alchemy between ingredients as basic as flour, salt, water and yeast. But the secret ingredient is passion. When you love your job, you want to do it as best as you can. As soon as I proved that I had what it takes to be a good baker, people trusted me and it made me want to surpass myself. In addition, my father set the standards high. He had nothing when he left Senegal to come to France in 1981 and succeeded very well in this field. Hes a role model for me. I only have a few memories of Senegal and what people told me about it but sooner or later, I'll go back there. I am 100% French and 100% Senegalese; these are two parts of myself that I can't separate. To the ones who want to pursue this great occupation, Id say Work and persevere. It will pay off one day! There are no barriers nor discrimination for the ones who work hard and well in this field. It is so difficult to find a good baker that, with a good deal of effort, you can climb the ladder and become your own boss.   The story is based on interviews given by Djibril to different media outlets."
256	Djimon	Benin	United States	A	N	far	1254	63123	H	im	male	I was a rowdy kid and my brother was the only one who could calm me down. Born in Benin, Djimon was the youngest in a brood of five. His older brother took care of the family after their mother moved to Cote dIvoire. His older brother, who worked in a bank, was able to save enough money to send Djimon to school in Lyon, France when he was 13. School bored me. Being educated and being intelligent are two different things. I thought I was smart enough. I stopped going to school as a way of saying I was mature, a way of saying I was going to choose who I was going to become. So at the age of 18, Djimon decided to quit school and survived by accepting small jobs. Since I had left school, I was not legal anymore as I had no longer the student status. Therefore, I could not work legally. So I was left out on the street. I could not go around too much either because I feared to be arrested by the police and immediately deported. From Lyon, Djimon decided to move to Paris with only 500 French Francs (80 Euros these days) in his pocket, and a backpack with just some clothes. He used to sleep in train stations, subways, or on benches in the streets. He navigated the streets trying to find something to eat. One day, his life took a drastic turn. A photographer took a picture of him in front of Beaubourg Art center and gave him his contact details. He suggested I should go meet a friend of his who was working for a model agency. They sent me to a couple of casting calls. As I was still sleeping on the streets, I had to wash myself in a fountain before going. One of the casting call was for famous designer Thierry Mugler. Djimon was selected and traveled to the United States as a fashion model. After a few years, Djimon became a successful actor based in Los Angeles. He is now a loving father and husband.  He acted in famous films such as Amistad (1997), Gladiator (2000) or Blood Diamond (2006). Hes the fourth male African who received an Oscar-nomination for acting. He is also an activist and became the global ambassador of Oxfam to fight against poverty and injustice. In 2009, Djimon addressed the plenary at the United Nations World Summit on Climate Change. Although he lives on the American territory, Africa is his continent. It is where I opened my eyes. Africa is a continent that provides so much for the existence of the rest of the world. We go around the world and cultivate so many things. One of the things I find extremely challenging about the continent of Africa is that when the immediate needs and the social needs of people are not met, that kills dreams, and it's all about survival. My legacy for my people exists. I need to tell my story about my worst days. I hope my people are proud of me. At the end of the day, you can never get away from who you are.   The story is based on interviews given by Djimon to different media outlets.
257	Donna	Guyana	Guyana	L	L	close	6956	6956	E	hc	female	My name is Donna and I am an involuntary returned migrant (returnee) from the United States of America to Guyana. On arrival in Guyana I encountered many challenges as a returnee, no different to others who return under similar circumstances to Guyana. Involuntary returned migrants encounter discrimination on return to Guyana because of their status as deportees and being often stereotyped as criminal due to ignorance and misinformation. The term deportee attracts much stigma and ones status as a deportee seriously hampers efforts of reintegration with challenges of access to basic services such as opening a bank account to employment. As a returnee I was determined to overcome these odds and was successful with attaining a tertiary education in my home country with a Bachelors of Law degree from the University of Guyana. However, noting the plight of other returnees I established a non-governmental organization called Juncata Juvant Friendly Society to attend to their needs and to foster partnerships and support on effective returnee reintegration.I believe Juncata Juvant Friendly Society expertise of understanding the needs and concerns of the community and our service and advocacy guided IOM in 2009 to forge a sound partnership with us for the implementation of the Reintegration of Involuntary Returned Migrants Program. The partnership between IOM and Juncata Juvant was a good one and the reintegration program directly supported more than 200 persons with essential services such as provision of identification documents, family reunification, small business start up, among other things. Juncata Juvant was instrumental in the preparation and provision of hygiene packages for returnees on arrival at the airport, job preparation training, counselling sessions and vocational skills training of which I spearheaded. IOM relied on Juncata Juvant for the on ground support to directly interface returnees and provide essential support needed in the name of the program. Today, many returnees are productive members of Guyanese society because of the reintegration program by IOM, the partnership between IOM and Juncata Juvant, and the leadership and advocacy I provided to the benefit of returnees.

Now I live in Switzerland, where I work in development communications and research. I live in Geneva, which is a very international city — I encounter people from all different walks of life come and go through here regularly. To me, migration means giving people the freedom to go places where their lives can be improved and they can improve the lives of others. I see that a lot here. Whether it's here or elsewhere, moving to a new country comes with many challenges. For anyone who wants or needs to migrate: this will be hard, but you can do it. Hopefully those who see newcomers arrive in their countries can be open-minded. They shouldn't point, stare or yell. The movement of people is a fact of life. Awareness campaigns could be a useful way to sensitize the public. The end goal of a life-changing move should be some sense of integration. It's necessary to adopt and respect  elements of the new home. But it's possible to do this while remaining true to your values.
259	Doreen	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	female	I am an American born in the Philippines, which is where my mother is from. I came to the UK in 2009 as a student for the Anthropology of Food Master's programme at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. After finishing the programme, I went back to the US and proceeded to apply for a Post-Study Work Visa, which is a visa now sadly on hiatus. I was granted the two-year visa and re-entered the UK in 2011, whereupon I entered several lines of work in order to gain work experience as well as support living in London. Sometimes I would work 70-hour weeks in two jobs and I'd still barely make ends meet. However, I was lucky to meet a number of people through my work. Eventually, through a combination of my degree, experience in social media and content management, and especially my work in pubs, I found work at a new East London brewery, The Five Points Brewing Company. I was the first hire after the head brewer, and was made full-time only a few weeks before my Post-Study Work Visa expired. I received my UK Residence Card the exact day my PSWV expired, and celebrated the start of my new visa, Tier 2 General Work Visa, with a curry. In my work with The Five Points, I have helped build a successful brewery that is undergoing its biggest expansion yet. We now employ 10 people, and will employ at least 2 further members of staff before the year is complete. Additionally, alongside our brewery's director I help organize the London Brewers' Market, which is a regular event at Old Spitalfields Market in East London that showcases independent breweries from all around London and allows them to sell their beer directly to the public, and allows the public to meet their local breweries as well as to try the fantastic range of brews this city has to offer. I further promote many small businesses, such as pubs and bottle shops, who stock our ales through events and social media. I even help promote other London breweries with my activity in the London Brewers' Alliance. I've been featured in the Total Ales beer blog in a new series called London Beer People, and I've represented our brewery in other British cities at events, as well as in Rome. Soon, I'll be going to Copenhagen on behalf of our brewery, and I will also be representing us in events in Spain and, later in the year, the USA. I'll be organizing The Five Points' involvement with several beer festivals and events this year, including London Beer City and Leeds International Beer Festival. Plus, we have two other London Brewers' Markets to plan, along with some possible offshoot events. It's hard work, but exceedingly rewarding when I can walk into a pub and see our beer on the bar, and know I had a part in putting it there.
260	Dotse	Ghana	Ghana	A	A	close	2206	2206	E	hc	male	Dotse, a returnee and beneficiary of pyschosocial support who returned to Ghana in 2020 after five years of staying in Libya, recounts his story of how his family and psychosocial support helped him. Dotse is lucky that he can count on his familys support which is not always the case for a returnee. My Name is Dotse. Im from the Volta Region. I traveled from Kumasi to Libya. I boarded a car from the Asafo market to begin my journey. I went to the border of Burkina Faso, and then on to the Mali border. In Libya, I went through a series of challenges: being cheated by my employer, low payment, and a bullet which blasted and destroyed my hand. A good Samaritan took me to the hospital and the next thing I remember was me at the airport. It took me a lot of effort to heal when I came back. I was disoriented when I arrived and do not remember anything that happened. But my wife tells me that IOM was very helpful in bringing me back, and even after I landed, they have supported me till today with covering my medical bills and assistance to start an agro chemical shop. Thanks to the psychosocial support, I am a better person today and I feel much healthier and happier.
261	Drago	Croatia	United States	E	N	far	13934	63123	E	im	male	"I was born and raised in Croatia, the former Yugoslavia, and 2017 will mark 20 years since my family and I arrived to United States as refugees. Unfortunately, my story is increasingly familiar in todays world. My family fled Yugoslavia in 1997, as a result of the civil war and its aftermath, in search of a better life. 'Better life,' -  what does that mean, really? Finding a place where you will feel a little more like a human again? In a place where you will not be judged by religion or ethnicity every day? I was 11 years old when the first signs of war appeared on the horizon and my family started the first of several relocations - at the time we hoped they were temporary. Soon after that, we became refugees. We lost not only our material possessions, but a little bit of our dignity too. Being a refugee is ingrained in your psyche because of everything you go though. After moving around for a number of years, our big journey to the unknown began. On the airplane headed to the United States I heard my father weep for the first time in my life. A million different thoughts and feelings were roaring in my head all at once. We were on our way to something new with very minimal knowledge of the language, place and people we would find on the other side. Still, we were ready for an opportunity. Thanks to hard work, some luck and amazing people we met along the way, we were able to learn the language, integrate and excel. My parents had a harder time than my brother and I, but I know they did it for us and the future generation. Being a father myself today, I realize just how much parents are willing to sacrifice for their children. Sometimes I wonder if I was born in the wrong place at the wrong time; maybe my life would have been different if I didnt have to worry about my religion and race from a young age. Even though many years have passed since I first left my country, I still dont feel like I have a physical home. Instead, my heart and mind are torn and I feel like a citizen of the world. I was always very silent growing up, and I did not tell many people that I am refugee or what my family went through, most likely because I didnt want to be judged or pitied. I no longer want to be silent. Refugees are humans just like you. Now I can proudly say that I am a refugee - what I went through made me who I am today."
262	Dylan	Canada	Congo	N	A	far	43560	1830	L	im	male	Throughout my studies in school, I was always interested by the future of business in African countries, and I was always drawn to how setback DRCs economy situation was, my motivation is always leading to that direction. Theres a lot of untapped potential and constraints in Africa. I wanted to see my chances for myself. I remember the first thing when I arrived at Kinshasa was seeing a big city. There was a bit of a culture shock at first but with some adjustments with social life and work I easily got integrated. When I signed up for my position online, the post was poorly described. I knew it was on the outskirts of Kinshasa but I didnt know it was in a village. When I visited my post it was in the middle of nowhere with trees everywhere and nothing else. I got shocked and felt like my life was going to get paused. I wasnt going to be able to start my business on the side as planned. I got involved with Global Shapers because it was important to get integrated in society and the culture, and learn about where peoples backgrounds. Its vital to making a project to help people at their homes. Im hoping to bring my growing knowledge and expertise back to my country. No matter how much I integrate well or how much time I spend here I will never know what its like to grow up here, and thats really important to start a local business. Here people are on their toes, entrepreneurs are striving to create their businesses one step at a time. In terms of mentality, there are many brilliant young entrepreneurs in Kinshasa. Unfortunately some of the systems in place prevent them from excelling at the rate that they potentially could. Im hoping to play my part in helping them while having fun doing so in this entrepreneurial environment. Living in a city like Hamilton you meet a diversity of cultures. In different ways it helps you grow up as a person. Its important to read and expand your knowledge but interacting with people is the only other way to really grow as humans. I am absolutely for people moving and experiencing other places.   Dylan is currently working as a business advisor for an Organization of Development and business in Kinshasa, working with local NGO in agro forestry and agriculture.
263	Ebenezer	Ghana	Libya	A	A	close	2206	4243	E	im	male	Ebenezers story: From irregular migrant to safe migration youth advocate After risking my life in the desert and experiencing exploitation and abuse in Libya, I felt the youth must know, so they do not put themselves in similar difficulties, says Ebenezer, a Ghanaian returnee. Ebenezer Bae, 23, is one of the returnees who have made it their mission to share their migration stories among their communities to raise awareness of the dangers of irregular migration. In 2015, Ebenezer chose unsafe means to travel to Libya. After a life-changing, traumatic experience he came back to Ghana in 2017. Today, he is leading a youth group advocating for safe migration in his community in the Bono region, an area that sees a high rate of youth unemployment as well as returns. I am fortunate to be alive because many did not survive, said Ebenezer during the launch of the nationwide #LetsTalkMigration campaign launched in Ghana this past summer. More importantly, what I was looking for in Libya, is in abundance in Ghana. I want the youth to understand that it is possible to make it here. He added: Our successes in life are not defined by where we find ourselves, but rather by our desire and passion. Money is important. But ones life is more precious. If you want to migrate, use the right channels.
264	Ebrima Bah	Gambia	Libya	A	A	close	757	4243	H	im	female	I have no doubt that this bakery will be of great benefit to my community and myself. It is going to be a source of food and income. In 2017, I left for Morocco attempting to reach Europe. At the time, I had friends who had already crossed the Mediterranean Sea and arrived in Europe. I decided to leave to provide for my family, but the journey was a really tough experience. After several futile attempts to cross, I returned home in early 2020. When I returned, I went into subsistence farming. However, this did not give me enough income. In my community, I remember one person calling me a failure, but I didn't care what they said. Luckily, my family understood me. The bakery is under construction. We can't wait to see the baked bread that will be sold in the community. I have no doubt that this bakery will be of great benefit to my community and myself. It is going to be a source of food and income, which will use the income to provide for my family. In the future, I hope to start another business in animal husbandry. Despite our progress, the border closures mean we are losing market opportunities from our neighbors in Senegal. Senegal is less than two kilometers away from here, so there is a potential market across the border. Like other businesses, ours wont be spared. As we are still setting up, I will not hire personnel that I cannot afford. Until the virus is contained, we are trying to maintain good hygiene practices while running our business.
265	Eddy	Democratic Republic of the Congo	Kenya	A	A	close	506	1879	E	im	male	"As the President of the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congos Childrens Parliament (2009-2012), I couldnt help but criticise the regime and the Congolese rebels for involving children in their political manoeuvres. I quickly became a political target and fled across the border to prevent falling victim to the conflict in the country I called home. When I fled the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the age of 20, I didnt know where I was going or if I would be welcomed into my new country. Kenya has certainly offered me this much needed warm welcome. My fear of being rejected was met with sympathy. Facing these hardships didnt seem as difficult thanks to Kenyan hospitality. Shortly after I arrived, I was recruited by FilmAid Nairobi, a humanitarian organisation focusing on educating and bringing psycho-social relief to displaced people around the world. In 2014, I got the chance to represent the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the One Young World Summit in Dublin. It inspired me to found the Happy4Life Network which demonstrates solidarity in the struggle for childrens rights and universal protection. I do feel that I have a mission; a mission of improving and changing lives of many children and other vulnerable people around the globe. One of my greatest life goals is to leave a better, cleaner, safer and more peaceful world to the future generations. I wish the gun was a pen and the bullet a pencil. I wish there were more educated people and far fewer refugees, and that we could peacfully resolve our differences for the sake of the children. I mostly miss my hometown, Goma. I miss the children I was spending time with, I miss advocating for their rights, and yes, I do miss the Congolese food and the freshness of Lake Kivu. Home for me is where I am comfortable, an environment where I feel safe, welcomed, happy, educated, healthy and useful. Although I love my home country, I would be happy to call any place that gives me comfort home."

In Somalia, she had witnessed people getting killed and houses broken into and bombed. Her family fled to different destinations and got separated from one another. Over 25 years, Edhabo travelled to Mombasa, then to a refugee camp in Kakuma and finally to Nairobi. In Kenya, she cleaned and worked at small businesses to be able to support herself. Despite all the challenges that have marked her life, Edhabo chooses to remain positive. I decided not to think about what Im going through because I know I will be okay in the future, she said on the day she was finally leaving Kenya to be resettled in America. When I get to America, I dont want to have to rely on someone. I want to find a job, maybe at a shopping mall, and pay my taxes. Her items packed for Wisconsin include cold-weather clothing, but, more importantly, clothes that are suitable to begin a new career.

I have two children living in San Salvador. My sister and I have always ensured our familys well-being. Im not rich, Im not poor but I managed to put together enough money to start this journey. Im looking for a better future. I decided to come because part of my family is living here and because of the difficult situation in El Salvador. In my country we had the means to survive, but I lost my job, so I chose to migrate. It is not easy to start a journey abroad knowing that youre leaving your family and the warmth of your country. Im taking this path because I have goals for me and my family. Travelling through Mexico has not been easy. I have slept in the streets, central squares, parks, bus terminals, and at the end I got a place in a shelter here in Tapachula. During my travel I was always cautious, but I got robbed in Guatemala and I was left with nothing. I am stuck here and I have not been able to communicate with my family. Theres still a long way to go. Fortunately, I have met with some Salvadoran friends who were already here and they have fed me, helped me with money and they have even tried to get me a job. I could momentarily work as a waiter here in Tapachula, however I need to speak with my brother to decide if continue my path to Monterrey or if I stay a few more days. I would like to work with my family in Mexico as soon as possible, and in a future, I would like to bring my parents and my children to live with me.

The day I heard I had permission to move to Canada, I applied to three universities. I wasnt able to go to university in Syria because of the war. A Lebanese man contacted my family one day and told us about the Canadian resettlement plan. He was a refugee once himself and had come to Canada during the Lebanese Civil War. He wanted to do whatever he could to help us, so he got money to sponsor our resettlement to Canada. In Canada, they have a real democracy. The people wanted to accept Syrian migrants and now its happening. Ive been studying violin for six years, but had to stop because of the war and the difficulties in moving around so much. Once Im settled in Canada, I hope to continue my studies and my violin lessons, but the thing I look forward to the most is being able to express myself freely and have people listen. I did all the research I could on my new home in Toronto. My family and I worked hard to come to Canada and we meet the criteria for eligibility, but I see myself more as a migrant because its not just about running away from war. Its about becoming Canadian, and starting a new life with a real future.
270	Egide	Congo	Ireland	A	E	far	1830	86251	H	im	male	"I left my country in 1996. I did not leave because I wanted to go to Europe but because I had to leave. I did not even know Ireland, I wanted to go to Belgium and do a PhD. I never thought of seeking asylum. A professor of mine in Congo was from Leuven University and he had always told me to go to Belgium. As I had to leave I naturally went there. Congo and Belgium have a very strong connection but because of the weight of history and this special relation, I went to Ireland instead, where I was obliged to seek asylum. My first feeling when I arrived was: 'I am happy to stay here, I feel safe and I can start a new life.' Seeking asylum was hard. Me, an asylum seeker? Back in Congo I was a lecturer at the university. I could see asylum seekers and every time I would think that it must be tough. You have to change everything in your life. Once in Ireland, it was hard as I did not speak English at all, I was not allowed to work and I was attacked. I told myself I'm educated.I'm not obliged to stay here. If they want me it's fine, otherwise I leave. It was really not easy. I would always ask myself What about my career? What kind of job can I do without speaking the language? Back then asylum seekers were treated well in Ireland: I had accommodation and social welfare but I could not work. So I would sit at home the whole day. This was the hardest part. Irish people are nice. They can be shy but if you're proactive, they want to find out more about you. I don't believe that they are racists. People are sometimes scared of the unknown but when you start speaking and they see you're contributing, you're working, they are supportive. I think that migration is not too much about Europe being better than our countries. It's about the situation back home. People are moving because of injustice, inequalities back home; not because Europe is seen as heaven. Migrants are here. It's a fact so there should be strong policies of inclusion. If this is not happening, migrants, the youth especially, will be frustrated. The children of migrants, who were born here, who do not have the accent we have, they still feel the injustice when it comes to employment or social integration. They feel frustrated. They are more vulnerable and this is when they can be exploited by extremist groups."
271	Elena	Russian Federation	Romania	O	E	far	10166	12929	E	im	female	"I was in Moscow, living the life I thought I needed after moving to the capital to find success. But the only thing I was missing was actually being happy. In 2012, I wanted to help my sister find love and I created an account for her on a dating website, hoping she would not give up again after a few months. As fate would have it, and as a musician herself, she met a fairly famous orchestra conductor in Romania and they are very happily married now. After she got married she decided to force lifes luck and return the favour by insisting, every time I visited her, that I follow in her footsteps. She said maybe it would change my life, too. I was hesitant about moving so far away from home and moving to a country where I barely knew the language. During one visit I ended up going on a date; I didnt feel like dating, but my sister was very pushy. She always dreamed that I would live in the same city as her and get married, but I never had faith in this option. She had two kids and I felt bad that she was spending so much time on the dating website, trying to persuade me. I came to Brasov to see her so many times that it started to feel like home; it felt like that pretty city that made me feel safe and where I could find meaning. In 2016 I met a guy who gave me a ring after just one week. I felt so comfortable with him, more like myself than ever, so I said yes when he suddenly proposed to me in front of his parents after one week. I alread had a plane ticket, so I went back home and when I woke up in Moscow I remember thinking: Oh my God, what have I done? I started thinking about everything I would miss if I decided to move abroad. But then I remembered this new feeling of being complete that was beyond everything I already had in Russia. I knew I would miss my friends and occasionally the food, but I can cook that anywhere! When I came back to Romania, it was the beginning of the most wonderful period of my life. I realized that I never loved anybody as much as I love my partner. It doesnt matter how much money someone earns, how they look, what they do. It's like are from different planets, but he is my greatest love; I love him more than I love myself. Now I believe that heaven is here on Earth and it is created by our ability to love. We must concentrate on love. The rest is just a distraction: businesses, hobbies, fashion, and all that stuff. Home is where my heart is, this isn't a cliche. I did not find true happiness until I left Russia and met the most surprising person ever, by accident. Changing countries was not easy, looking back I know it was a huge risk, but I do not regret it at all. I learned that the essentials in life are the ones you can take with you from place to place, even if you do not have luggage with you."
272	Eleonora	Argentina	Italy	L	E	far	8476	31238	E	im	female	I was 12 years old when I first left Argentina to go to Italy — my family moved for economic reasons. At that age, you are old enough to have established your group of friends, your activities and your routines. I was really sad when we moved and for a short while I didn't want to talk to anyone. Luckily it only took two weeks before I started feeling at home in Italy, but after a few years I started to feel the desire for something new, and I moved again to England when I was 19. All the moving and travelling I have done in my life has pushed me to accept that I'm not 100% from any culture, at first this was a challenge that I had to get over. But now I understand that it means I have a mix of cultures within me. I had enough of an attachment to Argentina to miss the food and traditions now that I'm away, but moving has allowed me to be a free spirit, to be strong and open-minded, and to be flexible. I would give the same piece of advice to those who wish to migrate and those who live in host countries - travel as much as you can! It is because of travel that I can consider any place in the world my home.
273	Elizabeth	Cambodia	Ecuador	I	L	far	1513	5600	E	im	female	It gets complicated when I am asked about my country of origin. My parents are from Cambodia, yet I have never lived there. I was born in a refugee camp in nearby Thailand, but I do not recall any memories of my life there. When I was about three years old, my parents and I were resettled to the United States where I stayed until my early 20s. As with most children of immigrant parents in the United States, I struggled to make sense of my multiple nationalities while growing up, which in a way, also propelled me towards wanting a life abroad. When I was 15, my mom took me to Cambodia for the first time. At that time, only 20 years had passed since the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime and the country was still in the infancy stage of rebuilding. For the first time in my life, I witnessed devastating levels of poverty, a consequence of the war inflicted on many who were unable to flee the country. Life for my parents was never easy in the United States, but they also found new opportunities that many in Cambodia could not have. After college, I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Dominican Republic. I learned never to take running water or 24-hour electricity for granted. For grad school, I received a Rotary Peace Fellowship to study in Tokyo, one of the most modern cities I have lived in. There, I had every amenity available that I could ever imagine. No matter where I lived abroad, I still grew homesick for my family and the United States but I stayed determined that I still had so much more to learn about the world. Currently, I am living in Quito, Ecuador and working with a refugee resettlement program. Life in Ecuador is comfortable. I never imagined that I would ever learn Spanish or that I would be working with refugees. I am extremely grateful for these choices in my life, that the decisions to move across different countries have always been my own. Being a refugee is never a choice, but hopefully we can all work to give refugees, migrants, and their children the opportunities I was given.

Elke and her husband started the project where Locals and Newcomers live and work together.   Elke: I remember Rama, when I first saw you. You were visiting your brother, and I saw you in the hallway. I just thought to myself: Who is this sad little woman?. Rama: Yeah, at that time I was so afraid of everything, I had fled from Syria, and then even had to leave a few other countries I lived in, because I didnt have a visa. And when I finally arrived in Germany, I was in a refugee shelter in the countryside, where I was the only woman. Somebody tried to enter my room at night, and I was just in a bad situation, I was scared of everything then. Elke: But then you decided to move to live with us, and I at first did not even recognise you. Rama: Yes, I felt better, less scared, and my brother is also here – hes the only family I have around me. My whole family fled Syria, after we had been arrested for our political views. Now my sisters live in different countries, and my parents went back to Syria – we hope they are now old enough not to be arrested anymore. So, now here its my brother and people like Elke and others, who are my new family. Elke: Here in the Sharehaus we are trying to live together as a community, but also to give newcomers the opportunity to start a new life, to make the connections and build networks for life. Rama: I need that support. Our country has been at war for nearly six years now, and when you have to leave, you leave behind your elders, the wise people. Now I have Elke and her husband, they support me so much. Elke: And I feel grateful and honoured that Rama comes to me when she wants to speak about her problems or just to share her thoughts. Ramas story and how she has changed – that enriches me! Also, I learn about her culture a lot and at the same time about me and German culture: I now think differently about some things. For example in the German culture there is this idea that we do everything right. That we just know better. I had to think about that and reflect. Also in comparison to the Syrians, we can really work on our hospitality. Rama: What we do here, is integration. We both are overcoming prejudices, we learn about each other. Its not so much about cultures though, more about people, about being kind and not to judge them. Elke: But also Rama and I, we discovered we already had a lot in common. We both believe in God, we believe in that universal love. We also share some values like commitment to other people and relationships. Rama: Yes, we both believe in God and God is love, no matter, how you call him. Superficial things shouldnt matter. And I think we have the same kind of soul (laughs). I think Elke is pure. Elke: And I like the way Rama thinks. You are so bright and open and share so much! Rama and Elke were strangers a year ago. They are now friends.

275	Elva	Colombia	Colombia	L	L	close	5333	5333	E	hc	female	"After working as a nurse for the FARC, Elva Fuentes tricked the guerrilla group to save the life of her daughter. Elva and her family became victims of a persecution that turned them into nomads, on the run throughout the country. Having no place to live and constantly moving like a nomad is terrible. You have no stability, no neighbors; you have nothing. These are the words of Elva Fuentes, a 51-year-old Colombian woman who, like many women in the country, is a mother head of household and displaced but also an ex-combatant. Elva was a member of the FARC for 14 years. She ended up being the nurse for the Eastern Block of the FARC almost without even realizing it. I worked as a nurse in a town called Labranzagrande. There wounded fighters from the FARC and ELN would arrive, and I had to take care of them. Later, they asked me to care for the wounded in nearby villages, and from there to the [guerrilla] camps, and before I knew it, I was in over my head with them. There were even orders for my capture and I had no other option than joining the group. I ended up being the lead nurse for various FARC fronts, she added. One of Elvas sisters raised her children while she worked in the mountains to cure those wounded in combat. One day a guerrilla commander asked me to cure the children of a family who collaborated with the guerrilla. I felt some affection for the boy and it was easy for me to make him one of my own. But my 14-year-old daughter feel in love with him, and he ran off with her to the guerrilla, Elva recollected. Elva stated that at that moment in her life, everything came crashing down because she did not want her children to be involved in anything related to her life. Also, her daughter got pregnant. I started to think every morning about how to get her out of there, to save her and my grandchild. Her blue eyes glazed over as she spoke due to the tears she could not hold back. Chased by the FARC Elva negotiated with one of the guerrilla commanders to be able to get her daughter out of the group. She promised to keep working as a nurse for the guerrilla as long as necessary if the commander let her daughter go and have her baby (which is almost totally prohibited for women in the group). The commander let her daughter leave the guerrilla, but Elva did not stay with the armed group. Once her grandson was born, she took advantage of a trip to Bogotá to demobilize. I went to an office of the Army, and there I entered into the reintegration program. A sister of mine had told me about the program and so I went. I got my daughter as well and she also demobilized. Thats when the persecution by the guerrilla began. For years, Elva, her children and her grandson lived like nomads, moving from one part of the country to another, running from the death threats they regularly received. After years of running, she was able to create a stable life in the eastern plains of Colombia. There she has a house and lives with her fourth son, who is seven, and who did not have to live the drama of war, displacement and persecution like his other older siblings. This boy has lived all the good, full of love, not like the other three, Elva said while showing a photo album of her children and grandchildren. Elvas outlook on life is now one of hope. She is about to finish her reintegration process in her new town, where she works by helping the elderly and handicapped people. I guide them; I go with them to appointments. You cannot compare yourself with a person who does not have of all their functions. They are at a disadvantage for so many things: people do not give them work; their health is delicate; and so I help them, Elva highlights. She also has been participating in a program called Women Promoting Peace. When people ask me if I regret what I did, I say no. I did not kill anybody nor was I ever armed. I ended up in the guerrilla because I was a nurse in a town that suffered a lot of violence. I went to war to save lives, Elva points out. As she speaks, she touches the photos of her children and her grandchildren. She dreams of them being able to grow up in a country with peace, where they do not have to live on the run, constantly persecuted wherever they go. Article by Angélica María Alzate Benítez"
276	Elvira	Peru	Brazil	L	L	close	6163	6797	E	im	female	I came to São Paulo 12 years ago when I could not find a fixed job in Peru. I wanted to go to the United States, but my visa was declined. So I came here to take care of an old Jewish lady. I think that everyone should be able to leave their country in search of new experiences and opportunities. When I arrived, I lived in one room with six Brazilian girls. They were young therapist students and as I was the oldest, Id always ask: Did you take your medicine? Did you take your umbrella? I felt responsible for them. Years later I started volunteering at Missão Paz, an NGO helping migrants get documents. The volunteering became a job and now I work as a secretary at Missão Paz. I also give manicure workshops for female migrants. While I teach them a profession we speak about anything. This is a place where they can share their problems and I can give them some counselling. Im happy to participate in the multiculturalism of this city. We organize events during Peruvian holidays and we prepare our traditional food. Brazilians are learning to like Peruvian food and I can tell you that Ceviche is one of their favourite dishes! If I look back at my experience, I feel in a certain way that to cross a border is like to cut the umbilical cord. At some point you start to grow new roots in a new place. Friends came to me and said, Now you cannot leave, you belong to Brazil!
277	Emal and Sibal	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	female	Emal, 5, and Sibal, 7, are two young sisters living with their mother, grandmother and extended family in Gaziantep, Turkey. Emal was born with a cleft lip, a birth defect where there is a congenital split between the upper lip into the nose. Before the surgery, she would be terrified of eating pasta because it would usually end up coming out of her nose, recalls Fatma, their mother. While easily treatable through surgery, the family had no access or means to have procedure carried out while living in Aleppo as the war raged on. We were sitting in our garden one day drinking tea when I saw a plane circling above us, and then I saw the bomb drop off the plane. The bombs nearly destroyed our entire neighbourhood. Almost every home held a funeral yet somehow we survived, but that was a sign for us that we had to leave Syria, recounts Fatma. Upon reaching Gaziantep, Turkey, the girls family searched for a doctor to carry out the needed surgery. While medical care is offered to Syrian refugees within the country, the hospitals in the city were too busy to treat Emal so they were referred to a hospital in Ankara. Unfortunately for them, they had no means of travelling to the Turkish capital. Eventually, their case was referred to IOM which arranged transportation for the entire family to Ankara where Emal underwent the procedure. Today, Emals bright smile shows no visible signs of her former cleft lip. While her younger sister is now fully recovered from her surgery, Sibal recently faced a challenge of her own - how to get to school. She is old enough to be in school but its too far away from our home and we have no way to get her there. We have no car or money for transportation, says Fatma. Following up on the familys case, IOM also began providing school transportation to the seven year old. Its really amazing what they have done for my two girls, says the happy mother.
278	Emanuel	Democratic Republic of the Congo	South Africa	A	A	close	506	5094	H	im	male	"The fundamental political and economic changes in South Africa in the early 1990s saw many talented people migrate to this country. The mix of people has resulted in South Africa becoming a hot-bed of creativity – particularly in the world of fashion. These immigrants see the country as a land of unlimited opportunities, and they have worked, created and prospered. One of these immigrants – DRC-born Fashion Designer Emanuel passionately wanted to break into the fashion industry; and most importantly, he wanted to share his fashion skills and knowledge with those less fortunate than him. Arriving in South Africa in 1999, Emanuel worked diligently to establish his business and a clothing brand. He started the Muzuri fashion line as a solid base to assist him gain industry credibility. After acquiring ample experience and skills, in 2009 his other dream became a reality: FUMU Empowering Connection was conceived. Emmanuel and Vincent – a fellow entrepreneur and social developer – set up FUMU, which is a Non-Profit Organisation in the fashion industry. This was done with the aim of changing the lives of many disadvantaged young people who are discouraged by South Africas ailing youth development and employment framework. FUMU targets young people from previously disadvantaged backgrounds with no skills and no access to tertiary education, and trains them as fashion designers and fashion entrepreneurs. Over the years, the programme has seen consistent growth and success. One important development was the expansion into manufacturing. FUMU Global Wear deals with mass production and has secured over 150 employment opportunities for FUMU alumni working within the programme. Moreover, FUMU participants are thriving in various areas within the fashion industry. Recently, one of a FUMUs graduates was nominated for the Ekurhuleni Women of the Month awards – for her excellence in the fashion business. Emanuel says he has kept the FUMU programme going because he is a staunch advocate of Ubuntu: I believe we are naturally siblings, all related in some way; we are just victims of our unfortunate oppressed history. We should take it upon ourselves to reunite and leave a lasting legacy for our children. Emanuel is making a big difference in the lives of the disadvantaged and he plans to expand FUMU. He plans on imparting more skills and knowledge, as well as nurturing future leaders who will promote African unity."
279	Emebet	Ethiopia	Ethiopia	A	A	close	840	840	E	hc	female	When we moved to Sudan ten years ago, things were going well for us. However, with the family growing, caring for the children became difficult. My daughter was reaching school age and we could not pay for her tuition anymore. That is why we decided to begin a new life in our home country. My relatives were very enthusiastic about our plans, but they also felt sorry because they had no means to help us in our journey. We heard about AVRR by word of mouth. In Sudan, we considered different options to make a living in Ethiopia. Once back, we opened a juice shop, but the economic situation worsened and we went bankrupt. It was a tough start, yet we did not give up. We had to sell all the shop equipment so that my husband could renew his driving license. Soon after, he found work, and our daughter could go back to school. For now, I am taking care of my children. I want them to get a good education. Once they are grown up, my dream is to open a hair salon.
280	Emily	Canada	Hungary	N	E	far	43560	16129	E	im	female	I am a student of Jewish History and I moved to Budapest for an internship in my field of study. Moving to Budapest was my first time ever living outside of Canada. My family has been in Canada for generations so we dont have any family abroad either. Leaving home was scary for me. I found moving to a new place entirely to be intimidating and the language was especially difficult. Language is the most challenging part because its the way you connect to people. I remember going to Starbucks in my first hour of being in Budapest just to experience something familiar. I am lucky to come from a privileged background and I prepared my accommodations before arriving. Having a Canadian roommate and knowing other Canadian students in Budapest was extremely helpful in making me feel safe and comfortable. The organization I work for also made an incredible effort to make me feel included and helped me sort out taking trains across Hungary and other practical matters. This support system has been essential to helping me integrate here. I soon found this would be the best experience for my personal growth. As much as it has been intimidating, its also been an adventure and a great learning experience leaving home. Moving somewhere new has given me a new sense of independence. I know I can still be me, just me somewhere else. I miss my family of course, I dont think that will ever change. What I miss the most about home is the familiarity and ease of getting around, which is something I hope will happen in time here in Budapest.
281	Emmanuel	Ghana	Ghana	A	A	close	2206	2206	E	hc	male	I suppose I am one of those who almost made it. You dont hear much about migrants like me, because we didnt die at sea or in the desert. We just didnt make it to Europe. I left home with dream of getting to Europe where I was told I would easily find a job which would mean I would be able to look after my siblings. My mother died when I was very young and our father basically abandoned us as he could not, or did not want to, take care of us. I felt I had no choice but to leave Ghana and try my luck in Europe. After months of travelling through West Africa by whatever means, I eventually made it to Libya where I paid 800 euros to men who promised they would put me on a big boat that would finally take me to Europe. It is difficult to explain and I have bad memories about this, but I had a terrible time in Libya. Those of us from certain African countries were treated very badly by the men who kept us in these dirty houses without much clean water and with very little edible food. They were very abusive and they seemed to enjoy the way the treated us. It did not matter to them that we had paid them all this money. Finally, one day, after several weeks of waiting, I was one of about 75 mostly Africans who were shoved onto a small rubber boat in the early morning when it was still dark. A few in our group initially refused to get onto this boat because it did not look strong or even big enough to carry all of us to Europe. The men in charge had weapons and were very aggressive. They were simply not interested in our complaints about the boat. We did not make it to Europe. Instead we spent 5 days aimlessly floating around and basically lost at sea. When the boat started losing air (deflating) we thought we were all going to die. As our food and water ran out, we eventually drifted towards the Tunisian coast where we were rescued and sent to a detention centre. I was in the detention centre for a month before I was freed. [Emmanuel was rescued from the detention centre and assisted by IOM in returning to Ghana where he was provided with reintegration supports including a small grant that enabled him to start a small business transporting yams to the market.] When I arrived back home in Ghana, my friends and relatives wanted to know why I had come back with nothing. Here I was back home, when others were busy earning good money and looking after their families, they mocked. Many wanted to know when I would try again. However, I do not see myself as a failure. For me, the most important thing was that I felt lucky that I had survived at sea and that I am alive. Although, I did not make it to Europe, I genuinely do not regret trying. One is certain, if I had opportunities here, I would not have been so desperate enough to try and go to Europe the way I did. If young people like me have jobs and a way to earn a living we would not try these dangerous journeys. After my experience, my advice to other young people is do not to make this journey. I know many may not listen and perhaps I too would probably not listen if I was very desperate to leave, but it is better to try very hard and make it here at home. If you have to migrate, do it properly, but for this to work, we need a lot of support. My dream now is to expand my (yam) business and end up employing other young people who would no longer be desperate enough to try and put their lives at risk. For now, I have no desire to try and make it to Europe again. I am very hopeful about the future. I wish many other young people are too.

282	Emmanuel	Somalia	Luxembourg	A	E	far	118	117182	H	im	male	I come from Somalia but my parents are originally from Guinea. As the whole world probably knows, Somalia has been a country involved in war for years now and this war is the reason why I left. The majority of Somalians are Muslims. My family and I however are Christians. The Catholic Church has helped us flee and start a new life in Europe. My parents died back in 2008, I have two brothers who live in Saudi-Arabia. We're still in contact on a regular basis through social media. I miss the family atmosphere and the closeness we had back in Somalia. You wake up surrounded by your parents and your family, you have breakfast and dinner together. I really miss that atmosphere, here I am just alone. I was born and raised in Somalia. I travelled to Italy by plane, where I received my papers. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg accepted me as a citizen and allowed me to continue my studies. So I consider all three countries to be my home. Europe in general is very different from Africa. The mentality is not the same, the people are not the same. People here are very well educated, and they allowed me to get an education as well. They are very humane and overall helped me a lot. There are different reasons why people migrate. If you come from a country entangled in war, you simply do not have another option. If you come from a country with extreme poverty and no access to food, you have no other option. Either you remain and try to stay alive or you leave and try to make a living, but leaving is like jumping without a parachute, there's no other choice. My goal is to finish my education and eventually become a tax expert in Europe.

I had a job in my country, but at that time it was not enough to buy a bicycle, much less to buy a car or a house, which was the most important thing for me at that time. In the United States I was able to achieve all of it while also helping my relatives who were still in Guatemala City. I have contact with them and every time I can, I visit them. This was particularly difficult before because I was one of the many undocumented in this city, however with the correct advice I obtained the residency and later on, the citizenship. I had a very critical health complication and the citizenship process was faster. When they are special cases, authorities provide certain benefits and it is one of the disadvantages for staying in Guatemala. It would have been harder to survive a chronic illness in my home country. Not everything went that way when I arrived in California. Finding a job was somewhat difficult since in the eighties the Spanish-speaking population was small and in most companies required English; I did not speak any. My heart breaks every time I remember the situations I had to go through to find work.   I think that if authorities had caught me on the road, back then, I would have gone back to Guatemala. It was a moment in which we could find security on the road and supportive people with whom to count so that one did not need anything. Nowadays there are many dangers and mistrust is increasing every time. I believe that job opportunities have characteristics similar to those of 30 years ago. In the city, those who work are able to take their families forward.

285	Eric	United States	Ireland	N	E	far	63123	86251	E	im	male	Eric Davis landed on his feet when he first arrived in Ireland. The software company where he works organised a penthouse apartment in central Dublin for him, and within a couple of hours of stepping on to Irish soil he had already made friends. He grew up in a Mormon household and was eager to reach out to the small community of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Ireland before moving halfway across the globe for work. Theres a Facebook page for young people so I wrote on it saying this is where Im living and asking which church I should go to. I landed on the Sunday morning, dropped my suitcase at my apartment and went straight to church. On his first day in Ireland he met a group of young people from the Mormon church in Terenure, who automatically welcomed him into the fold. Most of them are Irish. There are some other Americans who are over here working and theres some French and Africans. A little bit of everybody. He finds Irish people warm and friendly, but he thinks those outside the church are very different to friends back home. I wouldnt label Irish people as outgoing because compared to Americans theyre just more reserved. Theyre not as confident. The activities they do are different. He describes the Irish dating style as shocking. It drives him crazy.
286	Erica	South Africa	Switzerland	A	E	far	5094	86919	H	im	female	"I was born in South Africa, and my first experience of migration came at four years old, when my family moved to Israel. My first impressions weren't good and I hated it there; I felt like an alien and an outsider, it was like being trapped. As an adult, I migrated again, this time to Switzerland. Luckily I met my husband who is originally Swiss — he invited me to come back with him to Geneva and I agreed. Happily! I still haven't found a job and don't know enough French, but the feeling of freedom, the respect of my civil rights and my safety are unbelievable. There are of course things that I miss about my previous countries of residence. The views and general vibe of South African are on that list, as well as the food from Israel. My daughter and sisters still live in Israel, so that will remain my connection to the place. But migration to me means opportunity, the promise of a new life and, most importantly, hope. Home means reedom, safety, real democracy and civil rights. In Israel I had to adapt to a completely different mindset than what I was used to, and now in Switzerland I have to adjust to a new language — I'm still not there. Still, as a migrant I believe I bring hope, diversity and my own type of colour to my current surroundings. For those living in host countries, I believe they should be happy to meet people from diverse backgrounds, and that they should seize the opportunity to develop, learn and get new perspectives."
287	Erin	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	female	"I was born in the United States and lived there for 26 years before falling in love with a Scottish woman. It was impossible for her to move to the States so I came to the UK instead, pursuing a Masters in Environmental Education at the University of Edinburgh in 2008. I worked in science outreach at a variety of places including Our Dynamic Earth, the Edinburgh International Science Festival and the Dundee Science Centre before finding my current job at the University of Dundee College of Life Sciences. I believe I have contributed to the education of hundreds, if not thousands, of school children in Scotland in the past 7 years, and helped hundreds of scientists and engineers to go into primary and secondary schools to share their work and inspire children to take STEM subjects. Being in the UK as an immigrant has not always been easy; I have spent thousands of pounds on visa applications and lived in fear of not being able to stay in the country with my partner and the life we had built together. We got a civil partnership in 2012 and bought our first house together in 2013 and have every intention of remaining in Scotland for the rest of our lives. I have just received Indefinite Leave to Remain and it's a great burden off my shoulders, but there are many more hardworking, deserving people who may not be allowed to stay. I hope that in the future the UK will come to recognise all the great contributions immigrants make, both economically and culturally, and welcome them with open arms."

Then we came to Australia, and we have been living here since 2013. We came to Australia looking for a better future, a better education for the kids and better job prospects. Ireland has very cold weather and luckily when we came to Australia we landed in a beach town. We remember taking walks in the morning, the sun and breeze were beautiful. We thought, 'oh wow, we are in the land of promise now!' We left Pakistan a while ago and were used to being abroad but we do miss important people in our life, including our relatives and friends who we grew up with. We also miss our food and the environment of our celebrations. It is never easy to move around. Although it was our second time, there were different requirements to move to Australia and it was hard to get all the paperwork ready, tick all the boxes, and decide what to take and what to leave behind as we packed for our new life. We are still in the process of moving from temporary to permanent status in Australia; recent Immigration changes have affected us and it sometimes feels like a never-ending story. But we feel at home in Australia, we hope our children will finish their education here, get their jobs and set down roots in this country. I (Noor) am proud to bring my skills and experience to Australia, I work in a small rural town as a doctor and I know Im helping by taking care of families.

My father and his family are refugees. They fled to Syria in 1948 when they were forced out of Palestine with nowhere else to go. Syrians welcomed them. Im also a software engineer and studying for my Masters in virtual technology. I had always planned to go to Germany for my Masters, but Syria has given me everything in life, including a home for my grandparents and father, so I needed to stay here to do something for my country and people. When I was a teenager, hundreds of Lebanese rushed into Syria to escape the war in Lebanon. Syria was a safe haven for them then. That was in 2006 and thats when I started volunteering with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). Through volunteering I could fulfil my duty as a neighbor, a human being. Ever since, Ive been a Humanitarian Relief Coordinator with SARC in Homs, but I never imagined Id be serving Syrians. I want people around the world to know that the minute Syria accomplishes peace, we will witness the largest wave of human movement in history. In an instant, Syrians will pick up and leave Germany, Switzerland, and Europe. They will leave Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey; they will leave and they will rush home. The most memorable moment of my 10 years with SARC was in 2014 when we evacuated civilians and delivered food for the first time to the besieged Old City of Homs. It was a joint mission with the World Food Programme, International Committee of the Red Cross and other UN agencies. Even though we came under gunfire and mortar shelling, we pushed through. People were trapped there for more than 300 days without food or medicine and that mission was a turning point in the humanitarian response in the Syria crisis. It was scary, I definitely cant deny that we were scared, but our faith in God kept us going. When we had to cross the frontline, it was a combination of adrenaline, determination and prayer that kept us safe; a lot of prayers. I thought of my mother a lot that day. I called her when we crossed the front line to tell her I was OK. Then mortars started showering down around us, so we all ran down and hid in a bunker. We spent three hours there with no guarantee that we would get out. The last five years have been tough. When you live in war, you learn just how fragile and precious life is and that it can be taken away in a split second. Volunteering with SARC gives me purpose. Today, we are part of the wheel that keeps Syria turning and thats something I wont turn my back on."

There was definitely a huge difference in infrastructure. I can still remember my sister and I, waking up to gaze outside a huge window watching the city wake up. It was refreshing and beautiful. We felt in awe. Even though we were privileged to be raised in good conditions, we still wanted to visit DRC at times. I came back for the first visit in 2012. When we landed my heart started pounding and I was very excited. I dont remember much what I had left in Congo, I just remember the airport, some streets, some flash backs. I had a welcome back party organized for me, it was really wonderful. Overall I had an amazing time and because of that I wanted to come back. When I finished my project management studies end of 2013 my Dad encouraged me to work as a project manager in the DRC. I wasnt sure how I felt about leaving my whole life behind, but after some time, I took the courage and headed to the Congo. I immediately got the job and it has been a great blessing ever since. After over a year and a half, I resigned and started my very own Project Management Consultancy called Proman House and simultaneously started working in an Embassy in Kinshasa. The opportunities I got here in the Congo have led me to believe that in order to be great, you must leave your comfort zone to find opportunities and success. My goal is to give back to my country and to contribute as an individual to its emergence. I envision doing for my community in the DRC and worldwide.

In Tahiti we have our own culture with some influences from the United States Then, I enrolled as a masters student in Estonia through the Erasmus Exchange programme. I had a really good time here and a quite good connection with the European Student Network organisation . I then met the one I now call my wife who was a tutor at ESN! We had a long distance relationship for one year when I was finishing my last year of masters studies. During that time I also did an internship in Canada. We visited each other when it was possible. After finishing my masters studies, I took my things and came to live in Estonia. I had no idea what I would do here, I didnt have a job. One week before moving, I found a job offer for a French speaking person and applied. I had an interview on the same day I arrived to Estonia and started working on the next day. It all went very fast. I was extremely lucky. Coming to live in Estonia felt basically the same as I lived in France or Canada, I felt like a stranger there and here I felt the same although the language was a lot more complicated. I have been living in Estonia with my wife and two daughters for 6 and a half years now. I like that life is simple in Estonia and a lot can be done online. One of our daughters is handicapped, so in the process of getting support for her weve discovered that Estonia still has a lot of bureaucracy especially in the area of health care. Otherwise I like it here, we do wood for winter, clean the land, go fishing, and barbecues. I want to live a simple and happy life and Estonia is a good place for that. My home will always be in Tahiti but now it is here in Estonia as well.

I got married to a Romanian journalist who came to Cuba when I was 18, she said. We separated after seven years because things didnt work out between us. But I chose to stay in Brasov. At 18 you are just starting your social life, and that is when I had left Cuba. Even though Eymi has been living in Brasov for more than seven years and considers it her home, she nostalgically recalls the diversity and flavours of Cuban dishes. I miss food from home, she continued. You have just one type of banana in Romania, we have so many in Cuba. Fruits taste differently there. In Cuba we dont use fertilizers like here. I used to make infusions with orange peels and now I read in the supermarket that its toxic. An important obstacle that she still faces is the weather. Another one is peoples attitudes and mentality; she sees Reomanians as being reserved compared to Cubans. It is much warmer back home. People are colder here, too. Romanians say that they are warm people, but I think that Cubans are friendlier. Here, you cant do this or that in public. In Cuba, we sing on the streets, we dance on the streets, we are different. We think differently. Despite these differences, Eymi enjoys her life in Romania and is determined to stay in the beautiful city of Brasov for as long as she feels welcomed. She is very passionate about her medical career, which has brought her nothing but job satisfaction and a sense of achievement. For the moment, I want to stay here. I am working as a nurse at a dental office and I absolutely love what I do! Eymi also recently moved her mum to Romania from Cuba. She was too far and lonely there, so I moved her to Romania, even though she doesnt like the cold weather here."
293	Ezra	Germany	Switzerland	E	E	close	45909	86919	E	im	male	There are mainly two forms of migration: economic and political. Migrants seek out better lives elsewhere, because the conditions in their countries or regions of origin do not allow them to live decent lives. One of the first experiences that made me consider how I could help others adjust to being away from home came when I lived in Munich. My neighbours twelve-year-old daughter needed help with her homework because she was lagging in school. The mother and daughter were Kurdish asylum seekers from Iraq, and the mother's husband was killed in the clashes with Saddam Hussein's forces. I helped the daughter whenever I could, and on one occasion I accompanied both the mother and daughter to a parent-teacher meeting. It may have been a limited experience but it opened my eyes to many things, and after I left Germany to study, I understand even more about migration and integration. It is essential for those who move to learn the local language. It is possible to have different cultural practices, but it is better to keep them discreet until the host population becomes more familiar with the migrants, otherwise the fear of the unknown is likely to cause conflict. Although it is counterintuitive it helps when migrants reach out to locals, for example through festivals and charities, as this will increase the likelihood that locals will act kindly in return (this is because locals rarely feel that it is their responsibility to accommodate migrants.) Integration means adapting one's behaviour to match that of the host community: their language, food, communication, clothing, cultural interests and so on. However, it must be noted that there is cultural variety in most countries, so it can be difficult for the host population to define objective criteria for integration. Whether the host community decides to accept or reject migrants, it should get to know them well because choices that affect other human beings should be based on facts as opposed to conjecture.

I had the chance to learn French and English when I was abroad, and now I want to enable less privileged people to have access to this knowledge by establishing my own language school in my home city. This was my dream, however things were not that easy. Upon my return, I suffered serious medical conditions that forced me to postpone my plans for an entire year. Once I recovered, I couldnt wait to finally plan each detail of my school. I received support to pay for rent and buy furniture and school material. It made the official opening of the school an unforgettable memory.
295	Fadi	Syrian Arab Republic	Switzerland	M	E	far	890	86919	H	im	male	"I'm currently a student in Switzerland, but my first journey away from home was when I left Syria to work in Dubai at 24. While there, I worked in at the Crowne Plaza Hotel as a visa officer. My job was to process the visa requests for people who wanted to come to Dubai, and I lived there for almost 3 years. Now I live in Switzerland, and I do like living here so far. I didn't have too many problems adapting to the language or the traditions; I learned French very quickly and I speak English too, so it wasn't really difficult. The only challenge I have now is finding a job, but everything else is falling into place for me to feel somewhat at home. It's a concept that changes often, but home to me has always meant family, friends and the place where I spent my childhood. I remember feeling lost when I first got to Dubai; my family wasn't with me and it felt like I was starting from zero. To be a migrant is difficult but good at the same time, because it allows you to seek new opportunities for a safe future with no danger. At the same time, it is difficult to be far from my family and  the land where I was born. I had a good childhood there, and it is a land where we helped migrants and refugees before some of us become refugees ourselves."
296	Fadil	Morocco	Morocco	A	A	close	3108	3108	E	hc	male	My name is Fadil and I am from Morocco. I am a beneficiary of IOM AVRR programme. I had been living in Greece for 4 years and with IOM Greece help I returned back to my country on July 2017, benefiting with Reintegration assistance. As I had a 9 year experience as a butcher before migration, I requested to use IOM s assistance in order to make my own butcher shop. I benefited from Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration Programme (AVRR) and now I run my own butcher shop in my homeland in Marrakech. IOM Greece staff came recently to evaluate my business and I am really happy to find my shop very neat and clean. I got also a sanitary license from the relevant administrative commune. My business is running well as there are no similar shops in the area. IOM thank you very much, I will never forget this assistance.
297	Faith	Kenya	United States	A	N	far	1879	63123	H	im	female	America is a land of immigrants and in 2010 I happened to become one. Within my first year in the US, it dawned on me that the immigrants residing here were indeed all optimists at heart. We believe that we can change our circumstances and change them for the better. Most immigrants discover the hard way, that though they are well educated, their qualifications are most often not recognized in the United States. I obtained a public relations degree in Kenya but that sadly didnt count. In 2011, I enrolled for a bachelors degree in International Affairs at Kennesaw State University and became a volunteer with the Lutheran Refugee and Immigration Services of Georgia. During my time there, I became very engaged with the Friends in Hope project which basically is monthly prison visits to detained immigrants. I was also very involved with visiting newly resettled refugees regularly and became very passionate about it. I would visit a family or two and donate groceries, clothes and whatever I thought would be beneficial for a newly resettled family. I was passionate about helping the refugees as I knew that they were encountering many challenges resettling as most of them had never worked, having lived in camps all their life. That, placed with the language barrier, and misplaced expectations could overwhelm any individual. In between attending college full time, and volunteering, I worked two jobs. I worked as a student assistant at Kennesaw States Education Abroad office and at a local factory in Kennesaw. I was always exhausted but was determined to work hard and accomplish my goals. By January of 2013, I was a junior at Kennesaw State, and only had two semesters to graduation. I began to feel that there was more to just completing my degree and finding a good job. I wanted to volunteer more but with the demands of a full time job, the possibility of that began to seem bleak. In April of 2013, while taking a leadership course on campus, we toured a Montessori classroom and I became fascinated by the Montessori Method, and started thinking about possibly opening my own Montessori school someday. I knew that with Gods help, it was possible. Later I found out about International Rescue Committees micro entrepreneurship program for immigrant women. I enrolled but found out that the program was only geared towards home-based childcare businesses. Though I didnt stay in the program I gained the necessary information to get started. From then on, my goal was to start a Montessori School. I decided to start buying furniture and storing it and for one year, I didnt buy clothes, go out to dinner or even have a social life. If I wasnt in school, I was working or volunteering. I bought so much without even knowing when I would start. I also started taking training classes required by the State to open up a school. In August 2014, I located suitable premises, but I wasnt the only one interested in the building and I was the least qualified by all means. All credit to the acquisition of the building goes to God alone. We had to submit proposals and show financial proficiency and somehow despite being the least qualified God made this possible for me. After acquiring the building, I got an extra job to help facilitate the renovations as per the fire marshals standards. There were days I worked almost 24 hours and when I had any little spare time, I went into the building to help with the renovations. My goal had been to open in autumn of 2014 but due to major renovations that had to be done, the school finally opened in February 2015. Thankfully, I didnt have to worry about furniture since I had more than enough in storage. Looking back, that year of sacrifice was the best decision I ever made because I wouldnt have made it to both buy furniture and renovate the building. It wasnt easy opening a new school in the middle of the school year, however, I had faith that everything would work out. I had a great team of teachers behind me, and the Kennesaw community was really supportive of a Montessori School. Enrollment didnt pick up at first and I still had to work two jobs. I would go to the school early in the morning before anyone got there, pray, clean up and get ready for the students and teachers. At 9am, I would leave for work. I am still working elsewhere but not as much as I used to. The greatest blessing is that I have a great team of staff and I no longer have to go to the school every morning. Enrollment for the new school year has really picked up and some parents have already put their younger children on a waiting list. We have been privileged to award 4 scholarships for the new school year.
298	Famata	Niger	Chad	A	A	close	568	679	E	im	female	Famata has lived at the Foulatari displacement site in the Lake Chad region for 4 years, after fleeing her native island of Choukouli following an attack by Boko Haram. She is the mother of 8 children. Boko Haram arrived during the night and quickly started burning everything, she explains, all everyone could think to do was take the hands of their children and run, without thinking, without looking back, just try to escape, if you did not flee, they would kill you she said. On foot, she fled with her family to what is now Foulatari, along with other friends and neighbors who escaped the attack. They all had only the clothes on their back, thinking they would one day be able togo back and gather their belongings, some money, anything from the life they knew. Yet, when she returned just to grab a few items, her husband had been killed and everything was burned, all her animals, house, every piece of her life they burned everything, nothing remained she expressed. Famata has now found her place at Foulatari, being one of the strong voices for the community and playing a major role in the preparation for community events. She takes pride in her role, smiling when others enjoy the feasts that she prepares, and also in resolving community conflicts that arise. She emphasized the continued need for support, especially for the youth of the community, as poverty is rampant, access to water is becoming increasingly challenging and they are struggling day to day to meet their basic needs. Yet despite the adversity she faces, Famata remains positive, motivated and determined to make the best of her situation, not only for herself but for her community.
299	Fané	Central African Republic	Chad	A	A	close	481	679	E	im	unisex	My parents migrated to the Central African Republic (CAR) in the 70s after leaving Am-Timan (Chad) due to the armed conflict that would not allow them to live in peace. We lived in the capital, Bangui, and were citizens, Central Africans. The war that broke out in CAR in 2013 forced us to migrate to Chad, as we are of Chadian origin. In CAR, I was a shopkeeper, and had everything I needed. After coming to Chad and settling in Danamadja, I thought it would be useful to start my business again here. Today, thanks to my small shop, I am able to take care of my family of 9, including my 18-year old daughter who has been sick for the last year. For me, migration has been a way for my children and I to discover our country, Chad, and to make our contribution to its development.
300	Farah & Suzy	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	n	My name is Farha, and this is my daughter Suzi. We are from the town of Hassekeh, which is famous for many things in Syria—most importantly the food! It is famous for its delicious food, particularly the kebabs. Food brought people together in our community. Even though the town was very diverse, it had a very strong community spirit. Socializing was really important for us. All of that changed when Daesh came. They destroyed the land and made our life one of constant fear. We were always afraid of car jackings, kidnappings and bombings. I am a primary school teacher and Suzi studies pharmacology. Imagine, me as a teacher—having spent my day with 8 to 10 year olds—walking home with one eye on the sky and the other on the road to watch out for bombs and people who would threaten me. We are so looking forward to the peace and security Canada offers. My sister and niece have been living in Canada for several years, and my other daughter went there four months ago. We are really looking forward to being able to move on with our lives without fear. I cant tell you how much it will mean to feel secure again. Farha and Suzi are among the 25,000 Syrian refugees to be resettled under the Canadian Resettlement Operation.
301	Farasat	Pakistan	United Kingdom	I	E	far	1167	40718	H	im	male	Farasat was born in 1994 in a small town in Pakistan. He was living in a very peaceful environment with his family, until 2012. At the time he a student in the same high school that his father was a teacher, and also the president of the local councils department of education. We never thought about leaving our homes. We are still in love with our country, but we have no options. Due to discrimination between religious groups, his family was forced by the government to leave his posts and give up all his finances and properties, and was eventually imprisoned as well. Lots of people tried to encourage my father to escape. But, he didnt want to, and went to his job every day until he was arrested. We are Muslims, too. Only God can judge people in our religion. But our community is excluded from the society because of the differences in our beliefs. My father dedicated himself to teaching children, and he became a very important person. But he was blamed for teaching Muslim children and my siblings and I were blamed for playing with them… The main common rule in every religion is respect. And our own people werent respectful to us… We didnt have any hopes for our future in the country. Farasat stopped studying, and when his father finally finished his sentence, they began to look for possibilities for leave the country. We didnt want money, we didnt want power. We only wanted to save our lives… It was difficult for them to decide to leave a country that they were so committed to. Farasat said they were ready to give everything for their country. It was too risky to bring the whole family at the same time because all of them were being threatened. They moved city to city until they came to London in December of 2012. He still remembers exactly the conversation between his father and the UK border police. His father said: Do you think that I am a wrong person? I spent all my life in Pakistan and I am 55 years old now. If you send me back, they are going to kill us. And if I am going to die anyway, you can kill me here in UK. It doesnt matter where I die. And they received refugee status at the border. The UK helped them to reunite their family in September 2013. I found my life at the last point of it. Hope is never finished
302	Farhad	Iran	Greece	M	E	far	11183	18117	E	im	male	"It was 9:00 in the morning when the starting shot was heard and a human wave of runners started from the town of Marathon, in order to cover a distance of 42 km to the Panathenaic Stadium in central Athens. Among them was Farhad, a 46-year-old migrant from Iran, who has been dreaming to cross the finish line of the Athens Authentic Marathon for quite some time. He had been training alone and tirelessly, day after day, showing true devotion to his goal and passion, and last Sunday he ran his first Marathon, a celebration of human spirit. IOM Greece supported the 46-year-old migrant with appropriate running gear, medical tests and special long-run nutrition, in order to prepare for and participate in the run. Farhad begun running after he arrived in Greece. His journey was long and hard - through Turkey to Lesvos Island, then Idomeni on the border with FYROM and Elliniko in Athens.  He started training alone, covering the distance from Elliniko to nearby Glyfada and back, gradually increasing the distance. When he felt strong enough, he took part in two half- marathons (20 km). He joined the 35th Athens Marathon, on 12th November 2017, along with more than 50.000 runners from all over the world. Farhads determination was obvious from the very start. I will finish, he replied full of confidence when he was told that covering the whole distance and crossing the finish line would be demanding. And indeed, he finished 614th in 3 hours 22 minutes; exhausted, but deeply proud, with a big smile on his face. Farhad is currently living with his son in the open accommodation center for migrants and refugees of Thiva, which offers safe and dignified living conditions, thanks to the support of the European Commissions Civil Protection & Humanitarian Aid Operations Office."
303	Farhan	Somalia	United States	A	N	far	118	63123	H	im	male	Farhan is from Somalia, where he worked in the fishing industry. One of the main reasons I left my country was the civil war. My father decided I should leave Somalia because of how unsafe it was. I heard from friends about registering with UNHCR as a refugee, but the closest offices were in Nairobi and Cairo. He decided to go to Cairo, Egypt, and his father arranged the trip. During the flight, he made friends who helped him integrate with the Somali community there. During his thirteen years in Cairo he stayed close to the Somali community, which survives thanks to the support they receive from their families and organizations. It was difficult for me to integrate in Egypt. There are good people and bad people everywhere, but unfortunately I only met bad people, and that has made my experience hard. Farhan has not been back to Somalia in thirteen years, and says he now has not reason to return as he has no family left there. They have passed away while he has been in Egypt. He registered with UNHCR upon arrival in 2002, and was rejected for resettlement twice, but he was finally approved to be resettled in the United States on the third try. I know that theres freedom in the United States, and democracy. Everyone can rely on himself. Im hoping to get a better education and work so I can make up what I missed out on in my past.
304	Farid	Afghanistan	Afghanistan	I	I	close	508	508	E	hc	male	Farid was born in Iran, and lived there for all of his life with his parents. When life became increasingly difficult for Afghans in Iran, and it became harder to support his family, he decided to leave his 6 year old son with his parents since his wife had died a few years earlier, and paid a smuggler to take him to Austria. After 16 months of waiting in a reception centre without being allowed to work, his asylum case was rejected. Frustrated that he had waited for so long, but still was rejected, he decided that he did not want to appeal but preferred to return to his country of origin, not his country of birth. I realized that it was just very difficult for single men to get their asylum cases accepted, so I thought it would be best to return to Afghanistan instead of waiting and perhaps getting rejected a second and final time, the widower said of his decision to return to Afghanistan in January 2018. I had never been to Afghanistan before, but through the IOM support, I managed to build a life here. IOM staff helped him to set up a grocery store because a grocery store contains goods that everyone needs on a daily basis, so even if there is a lot of competition around, I thought I was most likely to earn an income through a grocery store, he said. Although the IOM assistance wasnt enough to set up his own store, he managed to find a partner through distant relatives in Herat city. When asked about his future plans, Farid was unsure. I have spent my entire life in Iran, and my parents are there. But since I have this store here now, I will stay for at least another year. And who knows, if I manage to find another wife in this town, I might stay here and ask my son to come to Afghanistan to live with me instead of going back to Iran. Afghanistan has its problems, but at least I no longer have the mental insecurity of being an irregular migrant that I had in both Iran and Austria.

It is a big day for Farzaneh and Amir as they are among the children who will go to the elementary school of the nearby village of Malakasa, in the context of the education programme for refugee and migrant children. Im really happy I will go to school, I can hardly wait! says Farzaneh, while receiving her school bag a few hours before the school bell. Neither I nor my brother, Amir, have ever been to school so we are really excited, well make new friends and learn many things. Accompanied by their proud dad, Asadullah, the children gather at the entrance of the accommodation centre where the bus and their escorts will pick them up. Im very satisfied that my children will finally go to school, says Asadullah. I just want them to lead a normal life, like any other kid their age.
306	Fasan	Nigeria	Niger	A	A	close	2085	568	E	im	male	"After I finished secondary school, I did not have enough money to continue my studies so I had to go out in the real world and learn a craft so I could make some money. The state Nigeria is in right now is not good for anyone. Even in Libya, when I told people I was from Nigeria, they looked at me as if I was crazy. The economy is not balanced in my country. Some people have a lot while others have nothing. I didnt have anything when I left back in 2014 – just one mother to look after. I spent five days trying to reach Libya. The driver is supposed to carry ten passengers, but smugglers pile up 40 people in the back of a car instead. Some people fell off the car; others broke their arms or legs, others died, but the driver never stopped for them. You wouldnt believe how many dead bodies there are right now in the desert. Once I got to Libya, I started working in a bakery. I worked hard for a couple of years and had even managed to save some money, but I faced a lot of bad experiences. There are some people in Libya they call informants. They look at you, they try to guess how long you have been there for and if you are a hard worker, and they will kidnap you if they believe you have money. If you want to work in Libya, your work place cant be too far from your house otherwise you risk getting kidnapped. At 8 PM everything shuts down. They kidnapped me and asked for 10,000 dinars to release me. At home, if you have that kind of money, you are a rich man. My friends negotiated so they agreed on 5,000 dinars instead. I couldnt call my mother to tell her; she would have died knowing I was in prison. My friend used the 3,000 I had saved and took another 2,000 so I managed to get out. Last year they kidnapped me again and I had to pay again. What is the point of working if at the end of the day they kidnap you and steal all your money? I couldnt go on like this anymore. This route must be closed. As a man, you can somewhat handle the risks this route entails, but as a woman, its terrible. They sell women as prostitutes every day. I saw Nigerian girls as young as 15 forced to do it - its a nightmare. Hopefully, things will soon change in Nigeria and we can make a future for ourselves there."
307	Fatb Katilan Khalid	Democratic Republic of the Congo	Uganda	A	A	close	506	846	E	im	male	When the war started in 1997 in Kisangani, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we ran to Buta in the northern Congo. My brother, who is now here in Kyangwali, Uganda, was kidnapped. He had disappeared, and we did not know where he was. I started living with my mother who was also alone there. My elder brother was not there and my father had been killed in the war… One night some people came and attacked us. We didnt know whether they were government soldiers or rebels. They came through the front door and started banging. My mother turned to me and said, You run, but for me, I have nowhere to run. So I ran and she remained behind. I hid somewhere in the forest but I heard her crying. I did not know whether they were beating her or if she was dying or what was happening to her. I was forced to leave her behind. I continued to run until I found some people who were carrying timber, who took me up to Kisangani, which is where my sister still remained. My sister was going to Uganda with her husband, because he was a Ugandan soldier. That is how we ended up coming to Uganda. We were taken to Northern Uganda to fight against the Lords Resistance Army, the rebel group in the north. We again suffered the same conflict that we experienced in the Congo. We would live in one place for two weeks, and then be taken to another place.  It was only in 2011 that I became a refugee in Uganda. Theres nothing specifically unique about being a refugee, but I think the life we have gone through has taught us something. Being a refugee is not easy. Some of us received the status itself with pride because we were suffering, but being known as a refugee, some people can actually undermine you. When you are in the refugee settlement, you are reduced… I think my source of hope is myself. I feel like every day I have to wake up and do something to prepare myself for the future.
308	Fatemeh	Afghanistan	Croatia	I	E	far	508	13934	H	im	female	Fatemeh is pregnant and left Afghanistan with her husband and three children. The reason they had to leave their country was the insecurity and constant threats to her husband who was working for the NATO for several years. In the end they felt their life was in danger. In January 2016 they left Afghanistan embarking on a long journey. They went to Pakistan, and then to Iran, after which where they were smuggled to Turkey. They spent one month in Turkey in the migrants and refugees camp then eventually managed to take the boat to Greece. The boat was overcrowded and the journey was very dangerous but they managed to arrive safe to Greece. They went on a 12 hours walk from Greece to Macedonia when Fatemeh fell sick during the exhausting journey. Finally they arrived to Macedonia and then to Serbia and continued their journey to Croatia and to Slovenia. Their aim was to reach Germany where they had relatives. However, in Slovenia they were told they would be deported back to Croatia, following Slovenian decision not to let Afghans pass the border. The family spent 20 days in Slavonski Brod Winter Reception and Transit Centre (WRTC) and after they applied for asylum they were moved to the Reception Centre for Asylum Seekers in Zagreb, where they have been accommodated for two months. They are now waiting for the second interview with the Croatian authorities and hope they will be allowed to live and work in Croatia. In Croatia they feel at peace, the people are very friendly and gentle and they believe their integration would be quick and easy. They were very satisfied with the support provided by IOM and look forward to attending English and Croatian language classes provided by IOM, which would be particularly important for her children and her husband and would increase his chances of getting a job in Croatia in the future.
309	Fatima	Algeria	Switzerland	A	E	far	3368	86919	H	im	female	I have been raised and educated in more than eight countries. But to make it simple, I am from Algeria--at least thats what my passport says. Im lucky enough to have left my birth country by choice with my parents when I was two years old. Since then, Ive had the option of going back to my country but chose instead to keep moving.  Again, I am lucky to speak from the perspective of a person who chose to move. At 24, I have moved to different countries 13 times and I really want this number to increase. Im currently living in Switzerland. I chose Geneva because Ive always wanted to work at the United Nations Office at Geneva. I really needed to go somewhere that looked like me. This means a place that respects diversity where I can keep working with people from everywhere, with all different backgrounds. Of course, I miss my family but they travel a lot as well.  So in the end I dont miss a lot about Algeria. I think its easier to do a thesis on quantum physics than to answer a question about where my home is. To be honest, I hope I always struggle to answer this question. I have friends who ask me Oh I bought you a postcard, where do you want me to send it? I have no idea. I cant give them a proper physical address. Im foreigner everywhere-- Im a migrant every day of my life and its just amazing. Again its a choice and its pretty different from having to flee due to conflict or war. I think the most interesting thing for me in moving to each place is how you learn about each person and each country you go to.  People you meet abroad open this whole new dimension and this whole new reality that youve never seen before.

Now, 13 months after arriving in Greece, shes about to relocate to Finland. I brought 12 children into this world, Fatima says, sitting on a wheelchair while holding a thick wooden cane. Now, two of my children are in Sweden, two are in Germany and another three are still in Syria. Fatima is surrounded by her son, Suleiman, her daughter in law and her grandkids. They all show a lot of affection to the soft-spoken matriarch. We left our hometown of Afrin because there was nothing there for us anymore. We have been through so much pain, so much fear, so many humiliations. I knew it would be a difficult journey but I could still walk on my own and I had my four sons with me, so that kept me calm and composed. We had to reach Europe and we arrived last February, on the island of Lesbos. Now, the time has come to move to Finland. Its always difficult to make a new start, especially for someone of my age. I feel somewhat apprehensive about moving to Finland, but all I want is to be together with my children and my grandchildren. I know we will find our way in our new home – I dont miss Syria at all, Syria is over for me. Suleiman, at 35, has to take care of his mother and his young family. I have dreams for them. My children are my biggest priority, of course, I want them to have the best possible education, so that they will be able to advance professionally. But, I also have my own little dream. Back in Syria, I was working as a car painter and I was looking forward to start my own workshop. I had to abandon this plan because of the war but now that Im moving to Finland, I will make my dream come true, I will start my own business, Suleiman says enthusiastically, holding his children in his arms.
311	Fatimah	Pakistan	United States	I	N	far	1167	63123	H	im	female	My moms family was from Kashmir. During partition, which divided Hindustan into multiple different countries, fearing for their lives, my family migrated to northwest Pakistan. My fathers family was Saraiki and lived in Lahore and Rawalpindi. Due to an unstable political climate, multiple wars with India, and lack of educational opportunities, much of my family, including my parents, migrated to England and to the United States of America. I was born in New York city, and both my parents died when I was young. I was raised by different people, both family and others. Much of my life has been spent navigating the intersections of my multiple identities: growing up Muslim in America after the 9/11, trying to understand my familys and countrys history, trying to uncover who my parents were and what they were like, and trying to traverse through America as a brown-skinned woman. Even though I was born in America, I have rarely been treated as an American. The attacks on 9/11 brought American Islamophobia to the forefront and marked many of my childhood experiences. Everywhere I went people asked me where are you from and what religion are you, trying to size me up, trying to remind me that I was an untrustworthy foreigner, among other things. Those questions now automatically scare me when I hear them, even though Im no longer a child, even though I am much more sure of myself and have spent most of my life living in America. While there are difficult moments in being a migrant and in the migration process, there are so many incredible moments as well. There are diaspora in America, and as a result, there are many beautiful communities that I have found home in. I grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I was friends with people whose families had migrated from many different parts of Africa, Latin America, South Asia, The Pacific Islands, and Europe. Our families navigated this new country together, and we benefited from building communities and friendships with each other. We learned from each other, we celebrated each other, we participated in each others customs and traditions. We created new pathways to fuse our cultures and to appreciate others in a way that has positively impacted my life and made me a better person.
312	Fatou	Gambia	Libya	A	A	close	757	4243	H	im	female	"I am happy to finally reunite with my family after many years of hardship in Libya. In 1992, I married my husband at the age of 17, and we went to Libya. My husband and I went there to hustle—I worked so many jobs, ranging from babysitting to housekeeping. Life in Libya was good, and everything was going smooth. I was working at the Nigerian Embassy, and then the uprising began in 2011. The embassy had to close down, but my husband and I stayed for around three more years, wanting to earn more. In February 2014 we returned home to The Gambia for a holiday and went back to Libya after a month. I spent majority of my adulthood in Libya; it was the only place I knew. But when I went back, things were totally different. Sometimes, it would be announced that no one should leave their homes., It was no longer safe to go to work, as you would be attacked on your way. Homes were being invaded, and all your belongings taken. We were only able to survive because my husband would sometimes go out and look for temporary work, which was also very risky because he could have lost his life. After four years of terrible living conditions, we desperately wanted to return home permanently, but there was no more way out of Libya. Flights were not available, and we did not want to journey across the desert because we were unfamiliar with that route. Fortunately, we met someone who told us about IOM offering people assistance to return their home countries. We reached out to IOM, registered and retuned home safe on a charter flight. In April 2019, we arrived back in The Gambia. Through our reintegration assistance, my husband I bought machines and opened a tailoring shop. During this past Eid, we made a lot of profit but, nowadays, it is difficult to find a serious tailor to work in our shop. This is why, in the future, I hope to gain firsthand knowledge in sewing."
313	Fatou	Senegal	Niger	A	A	close	1458	568	E	im	female	Fatou considers herself a migrant as she left her home country, Senegal, to move to Niger 4 years ago. What she misses most from there is the cool weather as it is extremely hot here. Although it happened smoothly, moving to Niger was a challenge. I grew up in Dakar – the beautiful and untouched capital of Senegal – not being aware of the poverty situation in some remote areas until I had the chance to work with migrants. I have come across all types of migration through my job. It is a real school in terms of humanitarian response and development needs. Moving abroad made me aware of this reality and taught me a lot about my home country. I am a legal migrant who works with irregular migrants from Senegal. Thanks to them, I have learnt about what is really happening there. Migrants coming from poor and remote regions have a very different life from the one I have in Niger as a migrant. I doubt that Ill live abroad until the end of my life. Ill probably go back to Senegal and use what I have learnt while working with migrants to contribute to my countrys development and to Africa as a whole.
314	Fatuma	Somalia	Germany	A	E	far	118	45909	H	im	female	I grew up in Kenya because my father was killed in Somalia and my mum had to look for a better situation. I love my family and I miss them so much, especially my mum. She is between the border of Somalia and Kenya, which is a risky place and hopefully I will see her soon. I am a social worker and I worked with different international humanitarian organisations, mostly in the field of child protection. I think that I can be an asset to Germany and I think they need me – just the same way I need them. I liked it here, but I did not like the situation that I was in – Ive been in a refugee camp for long, without being able to work, to go to school or to continue university education. This was one of the worst experiences in my life but hopefully things will change. In Africa, people come together, talk, discuss - here it is different, people lock their door. I think, the Germans are a bit reserved but if you talk to them they will talk to you. I moved into this new culture, so I have to be open minded which Im trying to do. And I have to educate myself with the help of my friends and the German society. The inequality, the injustice in this world, how we lived and how life was so hard – everybody looks for a better life and thats why we came here. I believe in a world of give and take. I dont believe in only take, take, take. We should be part of the process of change, we should be allowed to work. But we, the newcomers, should also play our part. They dont know who we are – so show them who you are! Do something for this society, be productive. But on the other hand: How can you become a part of a society that tells you to stay away? I will tell the newly arrived: Its all about trying, there are a lot of nice people. If one does not listen to you, somebody else will.
315	Faustina	Ghana	Ghana	A	A	close	2206	2206	E	hc	female	Im Faustina Sam. I decided to leave Ghana for Libya to look for greener pastures. But when I got there, it wasnt what I was expecting. Work wasnt easy there. Walking from home to the shop or workplace, you might be arrested. I decided I cant stay there anymore.I wanted to come back to my country, Ghana. I heard about IOM, so I decided to do some enquiries, and then I came back. When COVID-19 started, sometimes, when you went out to the market, you met people on the bus, who didnt wear nose masks. My mother asked me: Why dont you make some? When we go there, you can sell them.I thought about it, but I said, no, Id rather give it out to people [for free]. Later, I also got a call from IOM, asking if I can help with the nose mask production. And I said yes. I believe, if I wear it, and you dont wear it, the sickness is still around. I would like to help other people, especially children, who dont have anybody to take care of them. When you set your mind on something that you want to do – you can do it! You dont need to travel outside to look for greener pastures. We have everything here.
316	Favour	Nigeria	Libya	A	A	close	2085	4243	E	im	female	I came to Tripoli in 2010. For three years, I was worked as a housekeeper in different homes. When you go to a country which is not yours, sometimes you will face challenges. But that will not make you hate the people, no matter what the situation is in the country. Like here in Libya, when some of us wear African dress, others will turn to stereotypes and abuse us or call us names. Not even that will make me hate the people, because God brought me here, and God owns all the nationals. Libya is good for me. If Libya was not good for me, I would leave the country. As long as my job brings food to my table, I will love my job. Im a hair stylist now. What Im doing here and the way I would work in Nigeria are not the same. The work here is better. Its very hard in Nigeria. The economic situation and the government are not good. You cant depend on the government, because they will not put food on your table. You have to fight for yourself, so thats why Im here - to fight for myself. The first two years in Libya were fantastic because back then, when you worked, you would get your money at the end of the month. Back then, I regarded this country so highly, like America, because this is my America. But as time went on, it could take three or four months to get your money. In 2013, I opened my own beauty salon. The work situation before was better, now everyone is complaining no money, no money, referring to the economic situation in Libya. So, if dying hair cost 30 LYD, I will even do it for 10. Because when the nation was good, I enjoyed it, so now that things are up and down, I have to stand by the people. What makes me most excited about the salon is my customers. When they come, they relate to me as sisters, especially some Libyan women. The way they treat me makes me feel good. I like fashion. God created women to look beautiful, so I love to make women beautiful to their husbands. Even those who are not married yet should look good so that their future husbands can see them. I gave birth to my two children here, but when things got bad, I couldnt afford English school here. So, I sent them back to Nigeria. I miss my children even if their grandparents are taking care of them. Im afraid that they will not feel their mothers love. There is no mothers love there. No matter how life is with their grandparents, there is no fathers love. So, I feel bad somehow that we are not there with them and I cant bring them back here to Libya. Generally, I will tell people who work in Libya to have a holy life. To do only good things and love the people. That will be the advice I will give to them.
317	Favour	Nigeria	Nigeria	A	A	close	2085	2085	E	hc	female	"I was 19 years old when I left Nigeria. I had just completed my secondary school education and I was ready to start my first year of University when a man approached my mother with a proposition for me to go study abroad. He managed to convince my mother that he could get me a scholarship in Italy and all I had to do was give him the necessary documents for him to process the paperwork. After a few weeks the man came to our house and informed my mother that I had been accepted into a school in Italy and that it was a fully paid scholarship. He also informed us that I would be travelling by air to Europe and we should leave everything in his hands. Neither I nor my mother had ever travelled outside of Nigeria, let alone taken a flight. So when the man said that we would depart from the northern state of Nigeria instead of my home state Lagos, we did not question him. We drove from Lagos to Kano for 16 hours in a very small car; we were packed in like sardines. When we arrived in Kano, the man handed us over to another group of men who then told us that we were going to depart for Niger later on that evening. A small car came to pick us up and it drove us across the border to Zinder in Niger. In Zinder we were taken to a place where we met other people from different African countries. A group of men then came and told us that we were going to go to Libya later on in the evening. I did not know where Libya was, and I was also unaware that we were going to be driven through the desert. We left Zinder and went to Agadez. 30 of us were loaded onto the back of one small truck and we were given large sticks to support ourselves so that we wouldn't fall off when the truck was moving. After few days of driving through the desert we arrived in Libya. The journey to Libya was very tough as we drove past many dead bodies and a lot of people fell ill on the way. Whenever someone was too sick to continue with the journey, the driver would just leave them in the desert and keep on driving. When we arrived in Libya, the pusher man gathered all the women who were in the truck and handed us over to another man. The man took us to Qatrun, a city in Libya, and later sold us to a Madam who took us to a house and told us that we would be now working for her. I was very confused as I did not know where I was, and I just wanted to go back home. The Madam told me that if I wanted to go back home I had to raise a certain amount of money and then she would let me go. She then forced me into prostitution so that I could raise the money. The woman was very strict and we could not leave the house or make any phone calls. Every time a client came to collect us we would be heavily guarded. A few of the girls in the house tried to escape but they were easily caught and sold again to another Madam in a different area. It took me 10 months to raise the money that the woman wanted, and after I paid her the money I was allowed to leave the house. I met other Nigerian women in the area close to the house where I was living and they allowed me to stay with them whilst I was trying to figure out how to get back home to Nigeria. One night whilst I was sleeping, the house we were in was raided by the police and we were taken to a detention camp. The conditions in the camp were very horrible and a lot of people where tortured and abused there. After spending a month in the camp, officials from the Nigerian embassy registered our names and we were soon returned home by IOM. I was so happy to be back home in Nigeria as I did not know how I was ever going to return. My family was happy to see me as they did not know what had happened to me. Because of my experience in Libya, I decided that I was going to share my story with people in my community so that they do not have to experience what I gone through. I joined a programme that was being run by IOM called Migrants as Messengers whereby returnees like myself go into various communities advocating for safe and regular migration. I learnt how to conduct interviews and to use a smartphone kit to film interviews. Now in addition to sharing my experiences, I also conduct video interviews of fellow returnees who attempted to go to Europe via Libya. Collecting their stories helps us raise awareness of the dangers of the journey and we hope that more people will not be deceived and tricked into embarking on this journey. The things I witnessed in Libya are unimaginable and I would not want anyone else to experience them, that is why I am proud to be a messenger."
318	Fawzi and his wife, Hamide	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	n	Its been 11 years since the last time I saw my son. I cant wait to hold him in my arms again! Hamide is taking out her phone and proudly shows photos of her son who lives in Finland, where she and her husband, Fawzi, will soon relocate. Her face lights up as she talks about her son and Fawzi shares her joy and pride: Our boy left Syria to work in Europe when he was just 17 years old. He lives in Finland for 6 years now, where he works as an interpreter and hes engaged with a Finnish girl. It was the first thing I told during the first interview of the relocation procedure! I need to go to Finland! says Hamide. I have three daughters, too. One of them is with her family on the island of Chios. The other two are still in Afrin, our hometown in Syria. I hope they will be able to make it safely to Europe… she adds with a tone of sadness in her voice. Fawzi recounts the couples journey from Syria: we arrived in Greece on February 20, 2016. From Chios we went to Athens and then straight to Idomeni, but we arrived too late, the borders had already closed. We have seen bad things happening at the camp there… after about a month we got back to Athens and started the relocation procedure. At first, we stayed in a squat in central Athens and then we moved to a wonderful hotel in Nea Makri. It was so nice there, so cosy. You know, Greeks have been really supportive and helpful. They understand. I have worked very hard all my life, Ive worked in hospitals, in cafes, you name it, Ive done everything to bring my children up, and Hamide, too. Even now, we have crossed the sea and fields and mountains, we have endured so many hardships just to see our boy again. Hamide nods approvingly: I wish that my girls, too, will eventually join us in Finland so that we can be all together again.

To me, its enough that I will go to school! Fayaz and his family started their long journey to Europe from the historic city of Kunduz, in northern Afghanistan. They arrived in Greece over a year ago and they live at the open accommodation centre of Malakasa, 40 kilometres north of Athens. Im excited that my son will go to school. Fayaz has never had the chance to access education, so its an important time for us. And hopefully, his sister will follow, shes too young for school but shes a little jealous of her brother, said Feros, the father of the two siblings.
320	Fekadu	Ethiopia	Ethiopia	A	A	close	840	840	E	hc	male	"I left Ethiopia in 2012 to look for a job. I lived in Khartoum for 6 years, working as a cleaner in someones house. Life there was very challenging; sometimes we had work, sometimes we didnt, and we suffered a lot. After many challenges, my wife and I decided to return to our country and work. A friend had told us about the IOM and said that that they could help us return to Ethiopia. We registered in the IOM office and after nine months, we got the confirmation to come home in March 2018. Thanks to the IOM, we are now in a good situation. They transported us from Khartoum to Ethiopia and did a lot of things for us, so next to God they helped us very much, especially with economic reintegration. When we arrived in Addis Ababa, we went to the Transit Centre. At the Transit Centre, we filled in some assessment forms; they asked us what type of business we want to engage in when we go home. We chose an injera bakery. They also asked us what inputs we needed for the injera bakery and for distribution. They provided us with some of the resources that we needed such as maize, rice, water tanks, water barrels, jerrycans, an electric stove and the local stove for use when there is no power. We started the business and we are doing well, the only problem is power. So, we want to move to a house with electricity and we need to identify people to work for us to help us make more injera. At the moment, we have two customers, and we sell about 200 pieces of injera everyday. When we started, we made a loss but now we make a daily profit of about 300 ETB (approx. 10USD)."
321	Ferdaus	Afghanistan	Hungary	I	E	far	508	16129	H	im	male	"Slowly and slowly, Im really beginning to feel myself at home, so when I travel out of Budapest for a week or two I miss Budapest more than any place where I grew up. Budapest is the city where Ive become an adult from a teenager and the city where Ive become independent. Ferdaus Momand is a 26-year-old student from Afghanistan, one of the very first students who had the chance to get a state scholarship and the opportunity to study in Hungary. He came to the country in December 2009. I had the experience of being a refugee at a very young age. The year he celebrated his 4th birthday, the civil war broke out in Afghanistan, so his family had to leave their old life behind and move to Pakistan. We spoke the same language, we had the same religion and the culture was also the same, yet I had this feeling of not being in my own country. After ten years in Pakistan, in 2002 the family was able to return to Afghanistan. When Ferdaus got the scholarship to Hungary, he had five or six months to pack up his life, get a visa and get prepared for the big journey. I was somehow psychologically prepared that I will be in an absolutely different country with different language, religion and culture. I found the people very kind at the beginning, yet I felt the difference. The condition of getting the scholarship was to learn Hungarian for a year, in preparation for his university studies. According to Ferdaus, learning the language helped a lot and was an opportunity for him to get to know the country. Now, he feels more at home in Hungary than ever before. I have a lot Hungarian friends, dont feel myself an outsider because I also speak the language and because I dont actually believe in differences between races and countries. During the six years he has spent in the country, he was living in a dormitory with other students. He had the chance to get to know people from different countries with different cultural backgrounds, to make friendships and gain experiences which he would have possibly never done in Afghanistan. Living in the Hungarian capital helped him become the person who he is now. This does not mean that he doesnt miss his country. I miss a lot of things: first, my family because I havent seen them for three years, I miss food, I miss the place where we lived because it was very calm, peaceful and clean. Here, its a bit noisy sometimes; I just miss not having to run all the time. Im very busy and sometimes I need the peace I used to have back home, which is an other kind of peace we generally dont have in Afghanistan [hes laughing]. And I also miss the weather, the summer. Sooner or later Ferdaus wants to return to Afghanistan, but before that, he wants to get a Master degree in International Relations and work for an international organisation. When I return to Afghanistan, I want to go having an education and experience, so I would be able to make a difference as much as I can, as much as Im able to. This is the plan."
322	Fereshteh	Afghanistan	United States	I	N	far	508	63123	H	im	female	Fereshteh still recalls the first time she arrived in the United States in November 2012. I was waiting in custom line, I was very worried because I had an Afghan passport - a country depicted as a war zone, ruled by Taliban and terrorists - and also because I was wearing hijab [headscarf]. Then, Fereshteh looked around: While I was in my worrisome world, I noticed that there were many female employees working in the airport and wearing hijab. It comforted me a bit. When the officer called me I handed my document and he asked me: You came here to study, right? I replied: Yes. He smiled and told me Best of luck and welcome to New York! Fereshteh was born in Iran as an Afghan refugee during the Taliban rule. One year after the fall of Taliban, Fereshteh and her family moved back to Herat in Afghanistan. She was able to graduate in Computer Science from the Technical University of Berlin in Germany. Soon after, she set off to her city of dreams, New York. I found New York to be a very welcoming city where many people from different parts of the world are living together to make their dreams come true. There is a saying about New York: If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. Fereshteh founded Code to Inspire in 2015. The United States based non-profit opened the first coding school for girls in Afghanistan last November. Currently we provide a safe educational environment for 50 female students aged 15-25 from high school to computer science backgrounds. We are empowering half of Afghanistans population through technical literacy and coding to help women on a path to financial independence. Fereshteh is also the founding member of Womens Annex Foundation. She was the first person to bring bitcoin to Afghanistan, using it to finance her projects. Her mission is to educate and empower girls and women in Afghanistan through technology. Although Fereshteh has faced discrimination, she wont let her gender and ethnic background pull her back. What I believe is being a minority is not a disadvantage, I use it as a possibility to show that I can do and achieve what I want by accessing same and equal resources. Fereshteh has not always had the available resources to succeed but her determination and her mothers dedication were key. I remember when we were living in Iran as refugees, we had difficulties accessing education. We were eight kids in the family living in a new country and fleeing war. My mother learned stitching to buy notebooks and pencils which enabled me to finish my high school in Iran. I learned to use the best out of anything and it has helped me until now. Opportunities will not come to you, you should create them! Thats how I am living my 'Afghan Dream' in New York City.
323	Fikry	Belgium	Belgium	E	E	close	45028	45028	E	hc	male	I was born in Belgium, my parents came from the Rifs area in the north of Morocco to Belgium in the early 70s because my dad had found a job in Belgium and my mother followed him. I do not really consider myself to be a migrant. My parents, to me, are migrants, I on the other hand was born and raised here. I have mixed feelings about the term migrant. In any case, I feel very connected and sympathetic towards migrants. Migration to me has different meanings. Some people are looking for a better life, others find love in another country, and others may migrate purely out of economic reasons. I see it as something positive, something that can positively strengthen countries. I do think Ill move somewhere else someday. I havent figured out where exactly, it could be Africa, America or Asia, I could basically live anywhere. Theres a certain curiosity and relentlessness driving me, I do consider Belgium to be my home, but I certainly want to discover other continents or countries for a while. People who want to migrate should just follow their intuition. It could be a great personal experience, or might also turn out to be a less positive experience. Im not sure but I think I would in any case encourage people to do so, so they have no regrets later on. Migration should be considered as a positive thing. It has the potential to help countries innovate, it can be beneficial when dealing with an ageing population. It can give new energy and a new rhythm to a country and I think this is often forgotten when talking about migration.
324	Fiorella Esafe	Peru	United States	L	N	far	6163	63123	H	im	female	The following narrative is my personal experience as an immigrant, and it does not portrait the ideas of the United States Army. This is my story as an immigrant and how joining the United States Army has been a positive impact in my life. I arrived in Miami, Florida, in 2000. I have barely graduated high school and my mother told me that I was coming for six months to practice English and to learn what it means to earn my own salary. Little did I know that my mother had a plan for us to migrate to the United States due to the instable economic situation that Peru was experiencing after ending with the terrorism and the unstable government back home. After six months my family joined me here as we decided to make America our home. A few months later 9/11 happened and it was at that time that I thought about joining the Army and serve the country that opened their arms to my family. Also, at this time, my father decided that he didnt want to stay with us and he went back to Peru leaving my mother, brother, sister and myself alone in USA, which was ok since it was our choice to remain in USA. After a few years of hard work, my sister was the first to join the military. She joined the Marines since she was looking for a branch that was challenging for her. I waited till I became a US Citizen and I was able to earn a ROTC Scholarship and complete my bachelors in social work at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I received my commission in the Army Reserves as a Medical Service Corps Officer (MSC) and my first unit was the 18th MEDCOM at Fort Shafter Flats. With this unit I participated in the Ulchie Freedom Guardian (UFG) exercise in Daegu, Korea. Later on, I was moved to Fort Benning, GA, Fort Polk, LA and back to Fort Benning. During this time, I volunteered to deploy to Kuwait as an Executive Officer of a Veterinary Detachment during my time overseas I brought my Peruvian shirts and flag. In addition to that, I met other Peruvians and we had the Peruvian group, we hang out and became a family away from home. Upon my return from Kuwait I took command of the Veterinary Detachment, which is an uncommon opportunity for a MSC officer. I also started my Masters in Social Work thanks, once again, to the military by utilizing my post 9/11 GI Bill and my job as a GS Civilian with the Fort Benning Dental Clinic as a Practice Manager. During this time, I attended pre-Command Course and AMEDD Captains Career Course. In September I was selected for the Active Guard Reserve (AGR) Program which makes me a full-time soldier and received orders to report to Fort Gordon, GA. I have been married for five years to Nathan Esafe who is also a Service Member and is getting ready to retire. Overall my experience as an immigrant has been a dream come true. The support and assistance the United States Army provided me by funding my education is invaluable and taught me to be a leader. I am happy to represent the strong Peruvian woman in the United States Army and to serve the country and people of this, my home, without forgetting my roots and be proud to always say that I was born and raised in Lima, Peru.
325	Flavia	Brazil	Japan	L	I	far	6797	39990	H	im	female	Since I was nine years old I've been living in Japan outside of Tokyo. Although I could not speak Japanese at the time, I enrolled in a local public school. My parents werent fluent in Japanese either. Given this situation, I did not know the rules in school or even the basic Japanese customs. I was bullied because I was different. Some students even told to me to go home. I felt I did not belong anywhere until my junior high school days. After graduating from junior high school, I was planning to work for a factory as other Brazilian friends did. However, my parents kept telling me I should continue studying at high school and then university and that the only thing parents can do for the future of their child is to provide education. I entered high school and joined an English Club. My teacher advised me to participate in an English speech contest, which I did. I won a prize in my first trial. I began to feel confident in myself since then. Then my teachers encouraged me to go to university. They helped me study for entrance exam before and after classes as well as during summer vacation. I also decided to do all I could and studied as hard as possible by cutting my sleep and even time for bath. As the university I was hoping to enter had an international atmosphere, it felt very suitable to me. I moved to Tokyo to enter university and for the first time, I felt I was treated as an equal by fellow students. In one of the university classes, I learned that many Japanese students surrounding me did not know the actual situation of foreign nationals living in Japan, and I felt obliged to learn more about my own circumstances as well. I then started studying the plights of migrants and refugees. I got an internship and then I continued my studies on migrants in a graduate school in Canada. I am now engaged in a project to introduce Japan in Brazil on the occasion of Rio 2016 Olympic Games, to promote tourism to Japan and business opportunities between the two countries. This is an effort to make use of my experiences both in Brazil and Japan. In the future, I wish to be involved in a business endeavor where I can contribute to promote local employment and increase local capacity by helping in the expansion of Japanese companies business overseas.
326	Flavia	Italy	Japan	E	I	far	31238	39990	E	im	female	"Im originally from Rome, but I have been living in Tokyo since 2011. This wasn't my first time in Japan — I had visited the country in 2002 for a couple of months. Back then, I had just started to learn Japanese and I decided to come and get an idea of what the country was like. That first visit happened during the summer, and the heat was unbearable. Tokyo was crowded to an extent that I could never have imagined, and I would never have thought that a few years later I would be living here. But then I came back for a second visit, arriving in autumn, and my impressions were completely different. I also met many Japanese people on this trip, and those interactions made me think that I could manage moving here for a while. In March 2011, the strongest earthquake ever registered in Japan occurred; it triggered a major tsunami that killed more than 20,000 people and caused the nuclear accident of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. At that point everybody I knew was against me moving to Japan. Nevertheless, on my birthday I left Rome. I didnt know how long I was to stay. What I knew was that I needed to expand my world and push myself in another environment. I wanted to improve my Japanese and pursue my research of Japanese culture. I was an Italian teacher for 3 years and my life in Japan has gone through different phases. Currently, Im a researcher and I'm studying how the role of past-disaster memory can improve Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) policies. I think many foreigners do not know much about it and are in danger of being unprepared in the case of an emergency. Migrants are often considered a burden in times of crisis such as natural disasters, especially in Japan, because of language barriers. Id like to contribute in creating more opportunities for foreigners to be aware of disaster risk prevention and enhance their active participation. DRR starts with social integration, a process that needs to be developed in our everyday life. I do miss many things about my country and especially about Rome, my hometown. I miss my family, my friends, and the openhearted way in which Italian people communicate. Social interactions in Japan are completely different from those in Italy and I find them particularly difficult to manage. But I do feel that I have more opportunities here, especially with regards to my research; access to resources is easier and social problems here are on a different scale than in Italy or Europe, therefore it is easier to make contacts and find interesting areas of culture and society to study. As a foreigner who can speak several languages and has knowledge of many different cultures, I believe I can bring this diversity to Japan and improve its connection with foreign cultures. Japan is still closed to the outside and it needs people that can participate in the delicate process of cultural mediation. While I think it is important that Japan becomes more open to migrants and foreign cultures, I strongly believe that as foreigners in Japan we need to respect the country and learn as much as possible to be able to negotiate our presence here. People contemplating migration are often scared of what they do not know. Societies tend to be closed to outsiders because people fear losing their identity. Without trying to know the other, and especially without setting clear and reasonable immigration policies, the exchanges between Japanese people and foreigners will always end up in a cultural clash. I dont know how long I will be staying in Japan, but home is a warm place inside us made of human relationships and strong self-confidence. When we reach that place, nothing can take it away from us. We can live wherever and still feel at home."
327	Flor	Argentina	United States	L	N	far	8476	63123	H	im	female	The first time I came here I was 17 years old as an exchange student. I was a teenager and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Here, through volunteering, one day I got to go into the World Bank building and saw their motto: 'Our dream is a world free of poverty.' So I realised thats what I wanted to do: to work in this system, towards that goal, and help making it better. I went back to Argentina and studied Economics, but I always wanted to come back, it just felt right. This is the right place for me. It is very progressive, open and there is a lot of variety. People come from all sorts of backgrounds and world regions. This country was founded by immigrants and has the concept of freedom and liberty at its core – after all, the first settlers were people fleeing from religious prosecution in Europe. The idea was always that you can be free, as long as you dont limit other peoples freedom. I think that is still alive, and I believe in it - even if there is still things such as equal opportunities that need to be improved. Still, it can also be difficult to understand social cues, for example. In many ways I am an alien, a foreigner. I have to try harder to understand what is going on around me. I always feel like I have to be friendly, because I am a guest. Sometimes, when I feel the environment is hostile, I dont speak, so people dont notice my accent and know Im foreign. I am not a typical migrant, Im privileged and I am aware of that. I did not migrate out of need, but out of choice. Ive lived in many places and met many interesting people. I absorb a lot, take from every culture what I find useful and feel like a citizen of the world – while valuing my roots. Some of the recent developments are hard to understand, because this country used to be so warm and welcoming. But in many ways it still is, many people still are, and I will remain hopeful and keep an open mind. We all need to show by example who is a migrant and why we are coming here: it is because the United States is such an amazing country. And that is not just about money and jobs, its also about the opportunity to live a life in freedom, in a country that is built around that very idea.
328	Foday	Gambia	Libya	A	A	close	757	4243	H	im	male	I am happy to reunite with my family, and I look forward to expanding my bicycle business. For two years, I was in Congo (Republic of the) doing business. I had a grocery shop there, but I decided to come back home because business was slow. When I returned, I went back to my hometown of Basse and engaged in farming activities. I was desperate. I wanted to get to Europe. Three months later, I decided to embark on the backway journey. I left in December 2016 and got to Libya in January 2017. I started having financial challenges in Agadez, Niger, so my family supported me. My brother had to send close to GMD 25,000 (approximately USD 500) for me to reach Libya. My main goal was to get to Italy. I tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea on five occasions, but all attempts proved futile. In one of our attempts to cross, our boat had a problem, which resulted in many losing their lives. I will never forget that day. We spent the entire night at sea but luckily got rescued by the Libyan Coast Guard. Throughout my stay in Libya, I was imprisoned twice. Each time I went to jail, I had to pay a huge amount of money. For two months, I was not able to talk to my family. They thought I was dead. When the opportunity came to return home, I did not hesitate. The situation in Libya is unexplainable—all you face is imprisonment and forced labour. I returned to The Gambia in February 2018 with the help of IOM. Through the reintegration assistance I received, I started selling bicycles. I got into the bicycle business because I have friends who are in it and are making a living out of it. It is indeed a lucrative one. They guided and supported me from the start, and now I am established. I have customers that usually buy in large quantities and take it to rural areas. When business is booming, I sell about five bikes per day. I wish to expand my business and hope that other partners would come on board to help me achieve my dreams.
329	Fouad, Mohammad and Hamza	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	n	It is the last group of Syrian refugees to be relocated from Greece for 2016. Destination, Norway. Among the 33-strong group attending the cultural orientation session at IOM Greeces headquarters, Fouad and Mohammad seem particularly cheerful and they constantly joke about the cold Norwegian winter that awaits them, making everyone laugh. Fouad, a trained electrician, left from Aleppo and arrived on the island of Lesbos, Greece, 9 months ago, after spending six months in Turkey. In a camp outside Thessaloniki he met Mohammad, a ceramist from Deir Ez-Zor, who has been here about the same time, accompanying his 8-year-old nephew, Hamza. They became close friends and as luck has it, they will continue the journey to a new life together, in Norway. Im really happy to go, we can finally get some peace of mind, feel a little better, Fouad says. For both men, the priority is to learn the language and get a job as soon as possible. I would also like to study, says Mohammad as Fouad nods approvingly. Young Hamza, who has been playing by the Christmas tree, runs into Mohammads arms. Orphaned by a father, he left on the perilous journey with his uncle. Now, they hope they will be able to bring Hamzas mother and siblings to Norway. So, how does Hamza feel about the journey? I dont want to go to Norway, but I will go, there will be a lot of snow. Fouad, as we say goodbye, says: You should get us in touch with your IOM colleagues in Norway so that we can have friends already waiting for us! According to IOM official data, 7,068 asylum seekers have been relocated from Greece to other European countries.
330	Franca	Argentina	Estonia	L	E	far	8476	23106	E	im	female	In Buenos Aires I was a lecturer of law in tourism at the University of de La Empresa of Argentina. I like solving problems, so I also advised the students in degree choices, integration problems, communication etc. They would come to my office, saying Franca, I need your help! In 2014 my university sent me to Jyväskylä, Finland for a summer course. During that time I visited neighbouring countries. I was planning to continue my graduate studies in Buenos Aires, but visiting Tallinn, Estonia. changed my mind.I looked for graduate programs across  northern Europe, and chose Tallinn University. To prepare, I began reading about Estonian history and what happened in the country under the different rulers, about how Estonia became independent, and about its important role. I thought, I want to be there, live with those people, and learn more about them.  We are different in so many ways, but I thought I would like to settle down there, to combine my Argentinian culture with the Estonian culture. I respect how Estonians have been historically persistent and brave. After all the hard years under foreign rule, Estonians kept their own language, are proud of themselves, defend themselves and are hardworking. On the Independence Day celebration I especially felt this and thought,  These people are strong! The first thing I did was to take Estonian language course, so I would not be afraid to speak. People are kind when they see I am trying to speak Estonian. I think Estonians have values and they appreciate honest behaviour. I am honest, even my name means that in Spanish. Yet, I understand their reluctance and resistance to foreigners. Estonians are resistant because they have been under the dominance of several realms. Historically, much of what came from outside was a threat, so its understandable that they are afraid of the unknown. But  I havent felt any discrimination. I think they like me! Having different people in a society is not a threat. We can work on developing tolerance. My studies in international relations combine my law background and add an international point of view, which is especially relevant in terms of the migration situation. I would like to work with the integration of foreigners and help solve issues that happen when cultures combine. It seems everybody wants to come to EU because they assume life here is beautiful. Life here is not all rosy. You have to be realistic. I dreamed of meeting a tall, blonde Estonian man, but I found out it is hard to have a relationship with someone from a different cultural background. You cant have it all! If there was a perfect place, everyone would be there. Yet I feel part of the Estonian culture. Estonia has possibilities for everyone. It is a good country to be active and work hard. I think Estonia is good for me and I am good for Estonia.
331	Francesco	Italy	Hungary	E	E	close	31238	16129	E	im	male	Im a lucky migrant, Im a migrant by choice. I lived in Italy all my life and I was lucky to have a life that was already planned, but I wasnt happy. 11 years ago the Hungarian Ministry of Education was covering expenses for young teachers from abroad to come and teach in schools. I quit my well-paid job as an engineer to get a job as a high school teacher. I was a little scared but I moved to Székesfehérvár in Hungary. That was the starting point. I lived in Hungary for one year then I worked in several other countries (Greece, Spain, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, India, Nepal, and Myanmar) in various positions. After a personally and professionally difficult period, I came back to Hungary and felt immediately at home again. I started to understand that maybe my dream is something with arts and theatre which could be applied in Hungary. There is a need for intercultural education also for other marginalized communities, Roma specifically. I understood that there is something I can try to do alone or with some friends, we started an initiative called ANAMUH to try bring people together and create dialogue using social theatre and arts. I was lucky enough to have this possibility to follow my intuition to places where I think I could grow as a human being. I would invite people to follow their intuitions. Many people have this privilege: a possibility to make a choice to have a life or a job in Latin America or Asia and see how it is to live in countries where life is very different. To understand that the world we know is not the only world. Its only a small part of this global world. Then maybe come back to your own countries and have a different point of view about what you can do in your own country. It is amazing to taste a different plate, to know a different way of cooking, to experience a different way of living, to think about how the universe is conceived. Listen to different points of view, not to blend them, but to understand who we are as human beings as part of this planet all together and also as individuals. Home is a different space for everybody. The more you realize that there are many places that can be your home, the more you realize that home is not even a place. Home is a place inside where you can get refuge if things go wrong, if you dont feel ok, if you can close your eyes and find it somewhere deep down and you can feel that safety and warmth, that is home. That is something that you cant buy or sell or lose, but its something that you have to achieve and recognize.

I could not even get jobs in restaurants or work as a baby sitter. It was all lie, she said. Francoise like many migrants who attempt to cross the Sahara-Sahel region to reach North African countries and eventually Europe become the preys of insurgency and terrorist groups implanted in the region. I was in a truck with about 150 people, all on top of each other. It was an open truck and the sun was hitting hard, Francoise recalled. After driving through the desert for five days, we came across rebels [armed men]. They took everything; our money, our jewelry, our phones. They left us nothing. They searched all of us, men, women and children. They even touched our genitals to make sure we were not hiding anything, she said. It took them about 5 hours to search all of us. Francoise who left Cameroon with 700 000 Francs CFA ($1152/1067 Euros) was only able to save her phone. They took all the money I had left, she said. The ordeal did not stop there. Francoise said all the truck passengers were held prisoners in a house named le foyer until they would pay another 100 000 Francs CFA ($165/152 euros) to be able to get on another truck. I had no money left since we had been robbed by the rebels. I had to prostitute myself to make money and get out of there, Francoise said. I feel very uncomfortable, I lost weight, my skin is pale and I am itching everywhere, she said. I suffered a lot. At the time of the interview, Françoise was waiting to depart for Cameroon. She was ready to return home but felt ashamed. Now, I am afraid that my friends will make fun of me when I return to my country. I sold all I had before leaving. I lost everything. I will have to start from scratch."
333	Fraz	Pakistan	United Kingdom	I	E	far	1167	40718	H	im	male	I was the youngest political prisoner (4 years old) in Asia and perhaps in the world as I lead the Movement for Restoration of Democracy (MRD) in Pakistan in the 80s as the flag-bearer and child activist against one of the most evil and repressive military dictatorships. MRD was one of world's most massive non-violent movements since the time of Gandhi. Its objectives were to force military regime to suspend martial law, and to restore democracy and civil rights. It was an outcry from the people for a government that claims itself to be of the people, by the people and for the people. It was the early 80's and it had just been few years since a democratic government had been toppled, marshal law imposed, and a civilian Prime Minister hanged. The Soviets had invaded Afghanistan, which meant that the General's rule coincided with the war in Afghanistan, in which he was helping the US. Despite the human rights situation in Pakistan being assessed as very grim, US continued to support the dark rule- effectively legitimizing it. My father, Mr. MS Wahlah, a human rights lawyer and president of People's Party (PPP), was a central MRD figure. He made the unusual decision to have me - his only child - lead the protests, against a ruthless dictator, on the front line as the flag-bearer when I was just 3-4 years old. This was as an unprecedented act of courage and symbolism in an era when people were tear-gassed, imprisoned, and publicly lashed and hanged. My father did that to give the message that democracy and civil rights were the only way forward for Pakistan. I was first arrested at the age of 4 leading a protest   whilst holding the PPP flag - making the youngest leader of MRD the youngest political prisoner. I had become the face of democratic Pakistan. I led the historic movement  until 1988, when it finally achieved its democratic objectives. During all those years my father and I were imprisoned several times. As I grew up, I continued his legacy as a student leader and struggled for democracy against another dictator Musharaf. I adopted my father's legal profession to work for civil rights. I made my name as a leading international lawyer and was featured as one on some of the world's most prestigious publications such as CIO Magazine in US, Norway, Pakistan and Germany. In 2010 I also won the world's ICT Oscar for Pakistan. In view of my distinguished career I was offered to come to the UK as a Highly Skilled Migrant. I had a natural affinity with UK as my grandfather and his brother were in British Indian Army and had defended the UK in Second World War. This is what made me want to migrate to the UK and make it my home. In 2011 I started 1st Citizen in London, a law firm that ensures peoples' rights are respected and upheld irrespective of their caste, colour or creed. In 2013 BBC uncovered the historic photos of me leading the movement as a flag-bearer. It published and broadcast them with my featured interview as the Flag-bearer of MRD. http://bbc.com/urdu/pakistan/2013/08/130731_mrd_one_story_fraz_uk.shtml http://bbc.com/urdu/multimedia/2013/08/130815_mrd_fraz_wahlah_flagbearer. http://1stcitizen.co.uk/about-us/our-people/fraz-wahlah
334	Freddie	Iraq	Bulgaria	M	E	far	4146	10058	E	im	male	Freddie arrived in Bulgaria from Iraq 15 years ago. When asked why he abandoned Baghdad where he was born,  he smashed his cigarette butt for a few long seconds, looked through the window and quietly said so as not to be overheard, This is not important anymore. I am a Catholic, my wife is an orthodox Christian. We arrived in Bulgaria with our two children. After so much suffering we had been waiting for a single smile and nothing else and unexpectedly we found it here. We liked Bulgaria. I saw  love in these people. We could stay and work here. Why should we go to another country? Nobody is asking here what your religion is. At arrival Freddie had money enough to guarantee the wellbeing of his family for a year. He went to the catholic cathedral in the Bulgarian capital Sofia to look for assistance to find a job. I will always be grateful to the people I met. Many offered me money but I refused it. I took some clothes for the children and cooking utensils. Our mother tongue is Aramaic, the language spoken by our god. I was asked to contribute to religious ceremonies in the church by saying prayers in Aramaic and I agreed. When people realized that Freddie was a good cook, they started requesting him to prepare food for catering and recommended him to friends. Freddie regularly visited the markets to buy the products he needed for cooking and thus he established contacts with local traders. He started cooking as a full time job and was even been promoted to a chef in a prestigious restaurant. With a little help from friends, Freddie opened his own restaurant offering Iraqi cuisine. He named it Ashurbanipal after one of the greatest rulers of the ancient Assyrian Empire. Soon the place attracted a large number of Bulgarians amazed by Freddies meals. The restaurant also emerged as a meeting point for the Iraqi community in Sofia. I can proudly say that my customers wait for me to open the restaurant and it is not me waiting for them to enter. How did I become a cook? Well, I served as a soldier in the Iraqi army for 13 years. My comrades knew I could cook the best lentil soup. Once, after intensive training sessions they asked me to prepare it and accidentally, a bowl of my soup was served to the commanding officer as well. The next day, he sent a messenger to ask who had prepared the soup. None of the guys said anything because access to the kitchen was forbidden for ordinary soldiers. But the messenger was insistent. I confessed it was me to avoid punishment for all the squad. Surprisingly, the same day I was assigned as a chef at the army headquarters. The lentil soup saved me from being sent to the frontline to kill people or to get killed. This is how my career as a cook started.

Besides, I no longer had the permission to stay in the country. It was a difficult situation. During my time there, I could earn some money thanks to household work and photography. I found out that I was actually quite talented and I thought of developing these skills further in my country. Through my work, I seek to capture and document social themes such as migration. It is all about people. It allows me to transform tough experiences into something positive. With the support I received, I purchased professional photography equipment. I am now back home where I manage to generate some basic income from assignments as a wedding photographer. In the future, I hope to work as a photo reporter.

After the doctors confirmed the diagnosis, I spent 1 month in Austria and 8 months in Bad Staffelstein Rehabilitation center in Germany.The whole time that I was there, I kept thinking about my friends, wandering what they were up to. I had dreams that I was playing with them, but then was waking up in a foreign country far away from everyone I knew. But soon I learned that Germans are amazing people; they helped me overcome all my sorrow and pain. I was making more and more friends every day. People were visiting all the time! I still keep in touch with those friends that I made there. After I completed my treatment I returned to Georgia and decided to establish an NGO Step by Step, which unites people like me in an effort to defend the rights of persons with disabilities and to enable the future of disabled (this is the slogan of my organization). I am happy to be back with my family, friends and relatives and I am grateful for how my life turned out as a result of the support that I received abroad."
337	Ghaith	Syrian Arab Republic	United Arab Emirates	M	M	close	890	36285	H	im	male	I wanted to come here even before the war in Syria broke out. I wanted a better life, I am an economic migrant. But now I cannot go back, because I would have to do military service for the regime. In a way I am lucky, because most of my family left Syria a long time ago. At the same time it is very hard, were spread all over the world. My parents and one brother live in Saudi Arabia, my sister is in Turkey and my other brother just moved to the United States. It is difficult for us to even be in one place – I could not obtain a visa for my sisters wedding in Turkey. Now we had planned to all move to the USA, but it seems doubtful well get visa to go there. My situation in the Emirates is really bad: The visa is tied to the job, so if I would lose my job, I would have to leave. People here take advantage of the Syrians situation. They know we need the jobs, just to survive, just to not have to go to war, so we are paid way less for more work. Here its more about your passport than about your skills. People on European passports earn two or three times as much as we do. For me its okay for now, Im single, and have only got myself to care for. But you cannot have a family here. One of my friends from Syria came here with his family. He worries about how to pay the bills, the school, everything. He is looking so old now. I feel being in the Arab world as a Syrian, I cannot trust people. I think the people here would just leave me to die. So now Im trying to find a solution, a better place to go to. We never had a bright future ahead of us in Syria. Yet, I think after the war is over many of us will return to rebuild the country with the skills that we learned abroad. What I miss most is being safe. Now I cannot be safe in Syria, but not anywhere else either. I have no safety net. The culture here is very different. In Syria, even in the big cities, people knew their neighbours, here nobody cares. I dont know how to integrate into Emirati Society, there is very few Emiratis here, and they live in a closed society. We Syrians were pushed out of the place called home. But Im trying to focus on the positive aspects that the experience of migrating had on my life: Being a migrant means facing challenges, being pushed, grow faster, in my comfort zone that would not have happened. Yet, I am young and well educated. To other people it can be devastating. To feel the pressure, to have your hopes, plans and your very existence destroyed.
338	Gheed	Iraq	Netherlands	M	E	far	4146	53334	H	im	male	"Ive lived in Baghdad, Iraq for almost my entire life but I had to leave with my mother for the Netherlands in March 2011. It was not our preferred choice to leave our home, friends and family behind and go to a totally different country. Since the situation in Iraq was only getting worse from 2003 onwards, my mother, a secular university professor who did not wear a headscarf, had faced discrimination for a long period. She eventually received an envelope with a bullet and a threatening letter telling her to leave her work and our neighborhood or they would kidnap her children. Luckily I lived with my family in Syria in 2006 for a year. Life was extremely different, it was safe and beautiful. People were very nice to us, loving and caring. Most of the Syrians were very compassionate and took care of us, and we did not have to worry. Unfortunately, my mother had no choice but to take this threat seriously in 2010 when my brother was taken away. She decided to take me and leave. In 2011, the Netherlands was one of the few countries that offered refuge for Iraqis, so our smuggler took us there. We lived in four different centers all around the country and settled down in a house in the south for three years. We finally got a small apartment in Utrecht in 2015. I miss sharing moments with people of the same culture, I miss the air of my neighbourhood, and I miss how simple my people are and the way things work so naturally. It may seem impossible to have a normal life in an abnormal situation when you know you might die at any moment, but for us it was normal. It always fascinates me to experience new cultures and hear new stories. Moving from one place to another can be discouraging and painful when you have to say goodbye and leave people behind. But I always look for the positive side of every situation I face. Its not easy to keep in touch with people you care about when youre both in different time zones and situations but we always have to do our best to show how much we care about each other. I had to learn to not get attached to objects; it makes it easier to let things go. If you ask me where my home is, Id say its wherever I feel loved. Home is a state of mind, the inner peace that a person needs during the journey of life."

That same year I arrived in the state of Georgia. I remember that when I arrived it was hard for me to let go of some Hispanic customs in order to integrate to this new country. I lived in south Atlanta. There were few Latinos; I think myself and a couple were the only ones. In the United States, I began my studies at Mercer University and in 1989 I graduated with a degree in Fine Arts and a specialization in accounting. Six years later, I met my husband and we have been together ever since. In April 1998 we decided to get married. I lived for 15 years in Forsyth, close to Macon, but when my children grew up, I decided to move to Atlanta. After my studies in Mercer University, I continued studying in Atlanta College of Arts and in New York Institute of Art and Design. I worked for more than 20 years in a company, until I made the decision to begin my own project about something I have always been passioned about: accessory design. I started my own project that I named Peruvian Stamp where I design purses, bags and wallets using Peruvian materials. I even have two girls in Peru that help me sew! Its an only women group and I feel I help them to start their paths. I try to visit Peru at least 3 or 4 times a year. When I do, I enroll in different design and confection classes. What I miss the most about my country is the food and the evenings having tea with my friends. I feel very happy to represent Peru through my purses and expressing the Peruvian art and culture in my designs. In Atlanta, I already have two boutiques! My dream is to keep pushing forward with my business and get to other cities in the United States in order to make more people carry Peruvianess with them."

I moved here in search of better opportunities. The first thing I noticed about Australia was how multicultural it is. I also feel that it is a very welcoming place. Australia has a fair go culture to offer, so everyone has a fair go to achieve something and the same opportunities. It has never failed me so far. But I also feel the need to give my best in return. I bring my skills, hard work and my culture to Australia, which contributes to the multiculturalism. I miss the tropical weather and the beach from the Philippines, I love to go to the sea. One of my challenges in moving to Canberra was getting used to the weather in winter. Its so hard to adapt after coming from a place with tropical weather. But other than that, this country has been very open to me. My advice to people that move to Australia or anywhere in the world is to be open minded, welcome difference, and learn the culture you now live in! I would like for everyone to travel around freely and unrestricted by borders. That would be wonderful.

Slowly however, I got to know people. Good and kind hearted people, people who had the same principles as me. With time they included me as one of their own and supported me without being asked.

At 17, I went to Venezuela for an annual exchange study program. I was studying Spanish and all I knew was that a relative of ours moved there after WWII. While living in Venezuela with a modest host family in difficult social conditions, I learnt how to appreciate the small things in life and deal with problems from different perspectives. Thats the best lesson learnt, I still use it every day, also here in Hungary. Budapest is very intercultural and inspires me every day. I love the river, the way Hungarians enjoy and are proud of their inventions. I didnt explicitly choose Hungary: I chose to leave Italy, because I was disappointed by many things and I needed to leave my comfort zone again. When I arrived here, I immediately started meeting as many new people as possible, to better find myself, through understanding and accepting differences and choosing who I wanted to be. Most of my friends here are related in some kind of way to arts. I use music as a tool for integration. It is a language that everyone speaks. Even if I dont speak Hungarian, through music and dancing I can get in touch with people. I am an Intercultural Learning Trainer. I teach high school students about cultures, appreciating differences and finding similarities. I dont like that people are scared of differences or feel no need of going out of their countries; it hurts and makes it harder to explain that differences are beautiful. I travel a lot across Hungary, where I am hosted by very welcoming local families. Its beautiful and tiring at the same time: if you dont speak the language, they dont always consider you in the same way. However, I could learn something new from each person I met. I consider myself a migrant in its original meaning, not only because of physical travelling: I am fond of stories, I travel through music and dialogues. I am attracted to different backgrounds, languages, environments and religions. To me, home is where I can truly be myself: it has been my home town, Venezuela, Hungary or even this park where I am sitting now."

When she agreed to my travel, neither of us was aware of how bad the situation would turn. When I arrived in Cairo, I stayed at the agents house for a few days. That is when my troubles began. He asked me to repay him US $5,000 for the cost of the ticket and the visa, something that was not mentioned previously. I had no idea how I was supposed to pay back such a large amount. The first family I worked for paid US $400 per month but they were not treating me well. I did not have enough food, usually just a plate of pasta a day. Sometimes I called the agent to ask him to send me some bread or extra food but he never did: Thats life, he kept saying to me. I even asked my employers for more food - but they refused. I worked both as a housekeeper and a nanny. The only time I was allowed to leave the house was when I had to accompany my employers somewhere. Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore and asked the agent if I could change jobs. The second family was only going to pay me US $250 but I never even saw this money, because the agent would take it from me to put towards what I owed him. He even instructed me to tell my employers that I was sending the money to my mother so they wouldn't find out. At this point I was seriously regretting the decision I made to travel. I cried every day and prayed that I could return to Ghana. Eventually, my mother, who knew everything about my situation, found the contact information of the Ghana Immigration Service who introduced me to IOM in Ghana. My employer intervened to get my passport back from the agent, threatening to take him to the police. He got scared and sent my passport to the embassy. I was finally able to return to Ghana with IOMs help. Upon my return, the organisation also helped me set up my own shop selling different kinds of everyday items, including toiletries. After what happened I will never think about travelling again. No one should be a slave. Everyone should work hard in their own country and God will help them. If you stay in your country you can survive no matter what. I love my country.
345	Godfrey	Zimbabwe	South Africa	A	A	close	1466	5094	E	im	male	I was born in Zimbabwe and migrated to South Africa over 17 years ago in search of greener pastures and a better life. It was not easy to abandon family ties, familiar hills, child-hood valleys and adjust to a new environment, strange surroundings and intimidating streets full of bright lights. Almost everyone I met treated me with a sense of suspicion. They did not trust me because I spoke a different language and carried a somewhat heavy accent in their opinion. I was written stranger, foreigner, alien and migrant all over my forehead. Against all odds, I made a conscious decision to defy the usual and challenge stereotypes. I made it my personal mission to demonstrate that migrants are not just takers but givers too. They equally add value to their host country and warmth to their new home. Today, I run successful businesses that have created employment opportunities for over 100 South Africans. We produce and distribute thousands of life coaching and inspirational audio recordings on a monthly basis. These programmes help inspire the youth to focus on their dreams, unite broken families and assist fading organisations prosper. I also run mentorship programmes meant to lead, guide and support University students living in a country that has a huge dropout rate. I am a regular contributor for various newspapers and magazines and this gives me an opportunity to share my ideas and experiences. I have spoken on various conferences and seminars all over the world because I believe in the idea of global citizenship where people are allowed to live beyond their borders. Let us embrace diversity, celebrate our differences, promote a cosmopolitan society and eradicate xenophobia. Godfrey has also published an anthology of Letters and Poetry: http://the-passport.com
346	Gonzalo	El Salvador	Nicaragua	L	L	close	3799	1905	E	im	male	The first time I migrated, I was about 1 year old. My mother took me to Colombia while I was still a baby. When I was 12, I went back to El Salvador and when I was 25, I left again. Gonzalo is a leader of youth, engaged in social work and communication officer as of profession. Born in El Salvador, he spent his childhood in Colombia, returned to his native country, where he finished his studies and began working in a civil society organization, a human rights activist. My childhood in Colombia was common, I had my group of friends, I practiced sports, and had the family warmth of my mother, I try to visit whenever I can. When I came back to El Salvador it was difficult, even though I was born here, my habits, my accent and my expressions were those of Colombia, so my classmates laughed at me for being different. Over the years I settled in, the situation improved, I managed to finish university and at the same time work with groups of young victims of violence and other social problems. says Gonzalo. He considers that part of what led him to become an activist was discrimination he endured as a migrant. Finally, I realized that people are afraid of what is different and that there is no class or anything to teach us how to handle this fear and we speak, often badly, and we end up hating and exercising violence on others. It is possible that the link between being a migrant and those who laugh, judge diversity by showing something wrong, unconsciously made me want to be a communicator. For me, from a media or institution that deals with human rights, it's a responsibility and a commitment. We have the opportunity to be, well, one voice, and invite to include, respect and tolerate other people.  During the past year, Gonzalo has lived in Nicaragua. He still migrated, but this time the decision was made by him. Better job opportunities, he said, adding, It was also a matter of feelings, my partner is from Nicaragua, and one day we decided to be together and decide which country to live in. I volunteered to emigrate, after all, I was a migrant all my life. He concludes.
347	Grace	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	female	Ive lived in the UK for a while and I have always planned to stay here for a long time, and I will probably start my family here. The Brexit referendum was a bit of a shock, because it exposed a lot of anti-immigrant sentiment. So there is this nagging fear, sometimes I wonder if I might have to leave. It feels unfair that people could make a decision about my future while I did not have a vote. Im hoping to live my life between the United States and the United Kingdom. I really like the way of living in the UK - the culture, and how the more socialist system creates a sense of community that I like. At the same time, my family is in the US, and I really miss them, yet my boyfriend is from the UK. I think diversity is an exciting thing and makes a community stronger. At work for example: I can give the perspective of an outsider – its not more valuable than all the other perspectives, but ultimately, decision making is strengthened when done by a group of people from different backgrounds.The thing about being a migrant that I find most challenging is that I am lacking a sense of place. I never feel like I belong in the United States, but I sound American so I will also never be accepted as a British person either. Generally I think there is not enough credit given to the sacrifice made when leaving ones home – whatever reasons drove someone to migrate. Migration has been ongoing forever. Sometimes it frustrates me that it isnt treated like the norm that it is, but rather like something that needs to be regulated and stopped. Sometimes people have preconceptions about what Americans are like, so I try to introduce people here to the nice parts of American culture and hospitality by celebrating American holidays and sharing traditions.
348	Gregorio	Spain	Germany	E	E	close	27409	45909	E	im	male	I moved to Berlin in the end of September last year from my hometown Madrid. I came here, because I wanted to do a PhD in urban ecology and this field is very developed here in Germany. So there was no option to do this in Spain. I chose to come to Berlin because its a such a dynamic and stimulating city. When I came here, I was a little bit shocked of Berlin, because I thought it was gonna be more like the rest of Germany. But actually it reminded me of Madrid. First I got to Berlin-Friedrichshain. When I got out of the S-Bahn there, I saw these crazy people, just wandering around the streets and I thought: Ah, just like Madrid. But at the beginning it was a still hard, because I didnt have friends or anybody. And well, its difficult to adapt to a new city and new life. But I got some first help from Jonas, a friend of a friend, who is now a good friend of mine. He organized a flat of his friends, where I could move in for the first 4 months. My German is still very poor, and thats not a challenge even, because everybody is speaking English. But sometimes I can still feel the language barrier: I was in a burger joint with some friends when suddenly a guy came into the shop and started screaming very aggressively in German. And people were just looking at him, and I thought, Oh my god this is a big deal! But after he left, my friends told me that the crazy guy was just telling the owner how delicious the burger was. As an urban ecologist, I think I can contribute a lot to society. I know more about how cities work, environmentally, and with that knowledge I can give services to the people that live in them. Because right now, cities are just cities and we dont really know how to develop them from an environmental perspective. And I contribute to that – also with my knowledge I gathered in my studies in Spain. If Gregorio has to sum up home in one word, he answers sun. He mostly misses his family, his friends and Jamón Serrano. But he likes Berlin and has even gotten used to the cold winter by now.
349	Grigor	Armenia	Ukraine	I	E	far	4266	3557	E	im	male	My name is Grigor. I live in Ukraine. I am Armenian, but I was born in Iraq and have lived in various parts of the former Soviet Union. At a certain point in my life, I had no job, no health insurance and no treatment for my heart disease, so I travelled to Europe. I enjoyed the three and half years I spent in the Netherlands. I was treated with respect by the staff at the asylum-seekers centre, and they called me father because I often mediated when problems would arise. I received medical care for my heart disease, I cycled and I slept well. I returned to Ukraine because I had no other choice. I am known in my village, and after so many years abroad people were curious to see what I could do. I was a chicken farmer in the past, so I restarted this business. With the reintegration support I built a hen house on my land and obtained a loan to buy one hundred and twenty chickens as well as food, medicine and vitamins for them. My main task now is to pay back the bank loan as soon as possible, because I do not like to have debts. I take good care of my chickens, helping them to grow and then selling them for a profit. My goal is to increase the poultry to one thousand. I receive a pension from the state, which is barely enough to survive, so this business is a valuable source of income. I do not want to go to Europe again. I am content with my business, and I am too old for a new adventure. Now I prefer to stay in my country despite the difficulties of finding treatment for my heart condition. I tell the young people from my village not to go to Europe unless they have a residence permit.
350	Gubaz	Georgia	Italy	I	E	far	3984	31238	H	im	male	"I left Georgia when I was 16. First I went to Bulgaria, where I studied at the National Academy of Arts for about 10 years. I guess leaving your country at this early age is easier. After Bulgaria I returned to Georgia with my wife and child, a Ph.D degree in Conservation and Restoration and the will to start my career. Supported by the government, I initiated and created the first Conservation Laboratory in Batumi, Georgia. My wife - who is also a restoration specialist - and I worked hard to set up the laboratory and have done a lot of great restoration works together so far. After such achievements and success, I was eager to explore new things, so I decided to move. Some people criticized my decision to go to Italy. Only few supported me. When I saw Verona in Italy for the first time, I knew I made the right choice. The city is marvelous, breathtaking! Every day here is a celebration; I feel inspired by every building I see. With my experience, degree, enthusiasm and motivation I am open to new opportunities. Currently I am studying Italian and in my free time I paint icons. I am proud of the choices I made and I want to encourage everyone to follow their dreams."
351	Guillaume	Belgium	Portugal	E	E	close	45028	22413	E	im	male	"My name is Guillaume – it's a bit tricky to pronounce in Portuguese! I come from Liège in Belgium and I have been a migrant in Portugal for some months. I came to Lisbon to work for the Portuguese Council for Refugees (CPR) in Bobadela, to assess their implementation of the UNHCR policy regarding age, gender and diversity. I previously studied Political Science in Belgium and my thesis focused on the Asylum Procedures for LGBTQI Asylum Seekers in Belgium. Before graduating, I started looking for opportunities to work abroad and I was especially interested in Lisbon. I came here for the first time in 2016 and I was able to make friends quickly. I immediately felt that I could live here, but I knew at that time that I did not want to have an Erasmus type of experience in Portugal; I wanted to feel integrated. While preparing my immigration plan, I began learning Portuguese and contacted several organizations in Lisbon until I found CPR. This job opportunity is the perfect match for me and a chance to put my academic interests into practice. Working with CPR has been extremely interesting from a political science perspective to understand asylum procedures in Portugal, a country which has a recent history of more emigration than immigration. When I began working, I had the chance to attend the same Portuguese class that asylum seekers and refugees have access to when they arrive in Lisbon. Being so close to the people staying at the center, I became even more aware of my privileges, especially the privilege to have been able to migrate freely. I love Lisbon, its history and its high quality of life. I just miss my family, friends, Liège waffles… Oh and wearing warm clothes! I love how safe I feel here as a gay man – I am free to be who I am. I love the Portuguese language too, but I would say that the language can sometimes also be a barrier. For instance, sometimes I want to hang out with Portuguese colleagues or friends and be part of their conversations, but when they speak too fast I cant understand and it can feel isolating. Sometimes it leads to funny situations too: during my first memorable trip to the hairdresser in Lisbon, in which I asked the hairdresser in Portuguese to cut 1cm of my long hair at the time, but ended up having my head shaved with 1cm of hair left! It definitely helps to know people before moving here, as it can be difficult to make new friends, especially when you work full-time. You really have to create opportunities to meet people. I have also noticed that people assume immediately that I am a foreigner because of my physical appearance, but I wish they could speak Portuguese directly with me, be patient with my learning process and help me feel like I belong. Nevertheless, I understand that all of this is part of the process of my integration here!"

Now I live in the Jalandhar district and have set up my own dairy farm. I purchased two buffaloes that stay in a small shack outside of my house and produce 45 litres of milk per month. This earns me  around INR 9,000 – 10,000 a month, which is a good source of income for my family. I also help my father with his agricultural activities, and I am planning to save money in order to expand my dairy farm business. I am very grateful to IOM for helping me implement my business plan.

I had been living in Greece for 6 years, and with IOM Greece's help I returned back to my country on March 2017, benefiting from reintegration assistance. Initially, with the help of IOM, I purchased two cows for my livelihood and I set up a business back home in India's Amritsar district. Once I earned enough income, I purchase another cow and I managed to earn more money. Owning land next to my house facilitates my daily business routine and I am planning to buy more cows in order to produce more milk and expand my customer list. My job made me feel like I was part of the community, and helped me start a new life in my country. Thank you very much IOM. I am something more than happy. I feel important in my neighborhood. Coming back from Greece with nothing would have been embarrassing.
354	Gwen	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	female	I was born in the USA and came to Scotland in 2007 to study at the University of Edinburgh. When I graduated, I began working at a small tech company, helping with sales, admin and accounting. I have now moved to a Big 4 accounting firm where I am training as an auditor and working towards my CA status with the Institute of Chartered Accountants Scotland. I work with a large variety of listed companies, ensuring that they are in compliance with UK and international regulations and that their shareholders can be confident in the accuracy of the information they receive about their investments. I also do some work for the public sector - far from being a 'scrounger', I actually help councils verify that they are paying out the right amount of benefits! In 2013, I married my wonderful Scottish husband, who I met during university. We both love Edinburgh and decided to settle here permanently. Sadly, this has been a difficult process. During my most recent visa application, we were judged entirely on my husband's salary, despite my own promising career and the fact that I've been paying taxes here for years. Visa fees and flights home are also very expensive - I haven't seen my American family for more than two years. Still, I am incredibly privileged. Many immigrants who work just as hard as I do and contribute just as much to the British economy have a much tougher time due to factors beyond their control. I hope that in the future, with greater understanding of our contribution to the economy, immigrants will be judged entirely on our characters and skills rather than the countries we come from.

Supported by IOM predecessor, the Intergovernmental Committee for the European Migration (ICEM), Gyula and Eva arrived on the 17th of May, 1957. We had to start learning Castilian when I was 20 years old and my husband 34. It was a 17 day long trip to Colombia, but we were very grateful to the Colombian government that gave us  a home, work, and peace. They got married soon after their arrival in Colombia and ICEM, in coordination with the Catholic Committee of Immigration, helped Gyula find a job in Hormona Laboratories, which at the time was owned by a Hungarian man. The first salary he received was 450 pesos: More than enough to live on at that time, he recalls. By 1982, Schmidt received a new work offer to maintain and administer an estate in the Fusagasugá municipality. Theyve since retired and obtained their pension and now live in a house in Bogota. At home, Spanish is not spoken. Their language is Hungarian, and currently the only means they have to remember their origins. The only way to keep those memories alive and remember Hungary, the country they left 60 years ago.

When I got there, I started working in a fruit farm, which allowed me to develop strong skills and acquire valuable knowledge. Throughout these years, I had been thinking about how to make the most of my experience in case I would return home. Unfortunately, my wife and I separated, and I decided to go back to Ethiopia. When I arrived, I set up a farming business on a piece of land owned by my family in the outskirts of Addis Ababa. With the support I received, I purchased machinery and irrigation equipment. Things are working well. My brother is managing the daily activities of the farm. Together, we raise cattle and grow various vegetables. We are now employing 12 persons. I keep thinking about how to further develop the farm. I hope to start a poultry business and, who knows, build upon my network in Belgium to attract investment here. I know how lucky I am. Many people here dont have the opportunities that I benefited from.

Hakeem left Turkey to try to make it in Greece. He wants to start a new life there. I have many dreams but I must keep my feet firmly on the ground. All my thoughts go to my family that I miss a lot.

358	Hala	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	female	My name is Hala. I work for the World Food Programme and I am Syrian. I came to Turkey four years ago, early in the crisis. My family used to spend summers in Turkey, visiting relatives. When the conflict started we thought we could just pass another summer here, and that by the autumn everything would be settled so we could go back. But of course, we couldnt. I was studying English in Syria. I had nine more courses to finish but I never returned to my school. I am here now with my family. I am working for the World Food Programme as a field monitor assistant in Gaziantep, in Turkeys Southeastern Anatolia Region. We work in the most vulnerable districts. We identify Syrian families who most need our help. Our job is to come and register people door-to-door. We give them the e-food card, which they can use to buy the food they need in contracted supermarkets. I feel that it is a great opportunity for me, that I get to help my own people. I really feel that I should do this. I need to assist them because they are from my country. I feel happy when I see how happy they are receiving their cards. The war in my hometown of Aleppo is really bad but my life in Turkey is Elhamdülillah (Thanks to God) really good. I dont feel like a refugee here – I feel like Turkey is my second home. I hope everything goes well in the future because Syria deserves it. I am proud to be Syrian, I miss every single street. The people are really tired, they need to go back to their country and feel safe.

I was laughing and crying at the same time. I cant possibly express how grateful I am to the Canadian people to allow me to come to Toronto. Back in Beirut, I was living in a two-bedroom apartment with 25 other people. There was hardly any privacy, and life was too hard. My parents are still in Damascus but they wanted me to leave so I could escape the war and find a better future for myself. We have distant cousins in Toronto already, so when we heard we could be reunited as part of this resettlement programme, we were all so happy. In Damascus, I studied law. Its my dream to become a lawyer. But in the last year of my education, I had to drop out because my university was too close to the fighting. It broke my heart as I have a real passion for law. Im really looking forward to resuming my studies in Canada once my English improves. People here are so welcoming, and Im sure I will find support. I heard there will be free English lessons and I cant wait to start. Id like to study immigration law and maybe help people who are migrants, like myself. It will be difficult to settle in at first, especially in the middle of winter, but Im happy that I have family in Toronto already meeting me at the airport, and a community there to sponsor me and help me get used to life in Canada.
360	Hamdo and Hamadi	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	n	Hamdo and Hamadi are an elderly Syrian refugee couple living in Gaziantep. Having been married for nearly 50 years, the couple met at an early age through a traditional arrangement in a small village in rural Aleppo where they had four children. By the time the war started the family was living in the Aleppo city centre. Once the bombs started dropping they decided to move back to their village in the countryside. Although safe for a short time, a rocket eventually hit their home killing their son Ali and his children. Their deaths pushed them to finally leave Syria and flee to Turkey with their three remaining children where they have been living for the past 3.5 years. Since arriving in Turkey, life has been hard. Their children live in Istanbul and Gaziantep with their own respective families and are struggling to make ends meet: they have no room for Hamdo and Hamadi. As a result, the couple have had to find their own apartment in a neighbourhood where many other Syrian refugees reside. Today they live in a small and modest apartment with some chairs, a cot, an old blanket, and two framed photos of their son Ali and his children. In an effort to pay their rent, they have had to sell off their furniture and stove as well as portions of humanitarian food assistance theyve received from other humanitarian agencies. The monthly rent is 250 Turkish Lira, the equivalent of 80 USD. With no means to continue paying rent, IOM has been providing the couple with rental assistance for the last few months. While largely thankful and relieved to have a roof over their heads, they are aware that the assistance will not last forever and they worry about their future and what means they have to stay warm with the impending winter as they have sold most of their possessions.   Hamdo and Hamadi, an elderly Syrian refugee couple living in Gaziantep, look at the framed photo of their son Ali and their grandchildren. They all died when a rocket exploded on their home in a village in Southern Aleppo 3.5 years ago. It was the death of their son that finally drove them to leave Syria with their three surviving children.

Since went there as a minor from Afghanistan, he lived with six other young asylum seekers in an apartment and earned his income by buying, repairing and re-selling used smartphones online. My family in Afghanistan was very poor, and I went to Iran to live and work there as young as 14 years old. From there, I went with a smuggler to Turkey. For some time, I worked for a group of smugglers, cooking and cleaning for them until I had made enough money to pay them to take me to Greece. And there, I again worked for smugglers as a cook and cleaner until I had made enough to afford the trip to Norway. Unfortunately, after having lived in Norway for 6.5, his asylum claim was rejected and he was deported back to Afghanistan. With the USD 1.500 he received from the Norwegian government through IOM, he was able to buy a small mobile phone sales and repair shop in Herat. If IOM hadnt given him the technical and financial support to set up his own business, he would have migrated again straight away, perhaps back to Europe doing what I did before, he affirmed. …work for smugglers until I have made enough to pay them their fee to take me further. When I left Afghanistan to work in Iran 10 years ago, I left because I had nothing in Afghanistan. So if I had returned with nothing from Norway, I would have left right away again, Hamed explained.

Hamid will go back to the classroom after a very long time, as his mother, Khadire, says: Hamid and his 4 siblings attended school in Afghanistan but because of the volatile situation in our region we had to take them off school. We were afraid that the children would be kidnapped. Im really happy that my son will finally go to school here in Greece, one of the main reasons that we embarked on this journey is for my children to have access to education, it is really important.
363	Hamma	Mali	Niger	A	A	close	856	568	E	im	male	In 2012 Hamma was preparing for his high school exams in northern Mali. It had already been several years since Hamma had left his family and village behind to pursue his education elsewhere in the region. At the time, the stirrings of civil war were taking shape in the country. I was in class when I first heard a gunshot, Hamma recounted. The teachers quickly got us out of the classroom, put us on a bus, and brought us downtown so we could go home. But once we arrived in town, we saw people fleeing, armed vehicles everywhere and shots being fired. Whoever stayed put, would get killed. Following several attacks, hundreds of thousands of Malians scattered across Mali, and across Malis borders into neighboring countries. As for Hamma, he headed for the regions capital, Gao. His family had already made the 15-kilometer-walk to the border with Niger prior to his arrival. At his familys request, he, too, left for Niger, joining his parents and seven siblings, all waiting for him at UNHCRs refugee camp in Abala, in Nigers Tillabéri region. The refugee camp in Abala was hosting more than 12,000 refugees in 2015 when Hamma first set foot there. The crisis displaced more than 49,000 people into Niger. Hamma settled in. With a sharp mind, Hamma was drawn quickly to exploring the functioning of the camp. His skills soon were noticed by different organizations operating in the refugee camp. He got an offer to help with humanitarian surveys. Little by little, Hamma made a name for himself among the various communities within the refugee camp and beyond. With UNHCR staff and other international organizations, pretty much everywhere he went, people learned his name and welcomed him. UNHCR staff soon announced a scholarship for people who enrolled in high school and 27 youths applied. Weeks went by before Hamma learned he had won. A year from the moment he had arrived at the camp, Hamma was packing his bags for Filingué, Niger, where he would continue his studies. Housing fees and utilities were covered, and Hamma received a monthly allowance. Most importantly, Hamma passed his baccalaureate exams. Returning to Abala, Hamma learned of another call for applicants for scholarship, this time sponsored by Germany. Hamma was the only refugee in the camp with a diploma, so he was encouraged to apply. It wasnt furthering my studies or the pressure to succeed that motivated me, but the love and encouragement that everyone showed me, Hamma recounts. Its because of them that I am who I am today. Hamma studied marketing and communications in Dakar, Senegal for three years. Each month, half of his allowance went to his family, who had in the meantime moved back to Mali. He also would send fabrics to his mother so she could sell them in their village, and a pump to his father so he could improve his agricultural business. After finishing his studies, Hamma moved back to Niger and started working with different non-governmental organizations. Six months ago, he started working with IOM as a United Nations Volunteer (UNV). I am the only one who studied in my family so I do sometimes feel that there is a lot of pressure on me to succeed. My family often tells me I am their only hope, he says. As part of IOMs emergency response programme, Hamma works with implementing partners to assist vulnerable displaced communities in the region of Tillabéri, including those in Abala. With little employment opportunities back home, his family often relies on him for their daily bread. Each year for the Tabaski celebrations, he sends his parents money to buy gifts for his siblings. During his first trip, community members couldnt believe their eyes while some of them were even brought to tears by seeing him. Every morning, when he awakes, he finds another group of community members sitting on his porch, waiting to speak with him. The little ones he had met years ago were now big, but they still recognized him. UNHCR staff still remembered him and wanted to congratulate him. They told me they were proud of what I had become. Everywhere I went, they were all shouting: Hamma, Hamma! Hamma still sees Mali as his home, but he feels that Niger gave him opportunities that he would not have otherwise had. I dont think there is a more welcoming country than Niger, he says. But Hamma is not done just yet. He wants to continue his studies and get a masters degree. I never want to stop learning. There are so many other things to know in this world. I want to become the best version of myself. To respond to the highly volatile situation in the region of Tillabéri, IOM launched this year a 9-month long emergency response project in the region, with funding from the Government of Japan, aiming to provide access to shelters, Non-Food Item (NFIs) kits and medical support to 14,500 internally displaced persons. It is estimated that in 2019, 195,000 persons will need protection in the regions of Tillabéry and Tahoua, and that access to humanitarian assistance for the affected population will remain a challenge due to security risks and access.

365	Hanien	Syrian Arab Republic	Egypt	M	A	far	890	3609	E	im	female	"I arrived in Cairo in October 2012 looking to start my postgraduate degree in Architectural Studies at Cairo University. The conflict in Syria has made everything, including education, well-nigh impossible, so I moved to Cairo University after a decree was issued that stated that Syrian students were to pay local tuition fees. Syrian students do not typically have the luxury of worrying exclusively about their studies. They often have to secure a source of income to survive and to help their families back home. My home city of Ar-Raqqa has now been overtaken by ISIS who continuously threaten and terrorize my family and loved ones. Surviving in Ar-Raqqa is becoming exceptionally challenging, requiring me to increase financial support for my family. Right now, I am one of a relatively small number of Syrian students in Egypt who are pursuing Masters degrees. I have been coordinating with them as we try to navigate the universities bureaucracy; unfortunately, it has been difficult to obtain our degrees due to the ever-changing rules, regulations and fees being imposed by the universities on Syrian students. Since beginning my degree in 2012, Cairo University has changed the fees the three other Syrian students and I are required to pay numerous times. When we started our studies, we were required to pay the same rate as Egyptians (around $500)—after multiple changes, we are now required to pay £5,000 (British Pounds) or we will not receive our degrees. This may not seem like a lot of money, but this has been a long, exhausting and spirit-breaking issue for us. At the end of January 2015 one of my Syrian student colleagues chose to use the money he had prepared for tuition fees to pay his way on a refugee boat heading to Germany through the Mediterranean Sea. The gamble of possibly losing his life on the way seemed to be more appealing than staying in Egypt and continuing fighting for rights he knew he did not have. I cannot pay the fees—working two jobs gives me just enough money to pay my rent and send some home to my family. But if I dont pay, I will miss my chance to graduate and it will be like I never did the degree.

366	Hannah	United Kingdom	Italy	E	E	close	40718	31238	E	im	female	"I am a twenty-four-year-old British artist and love to paint the portraits of people I encounter on my travels; from African women in remote villages in Mozambique to Syrian refugees in Jordanian refugee camps. My most recent paintings have been of refugees I've met while volunteering in the Calais Jungle. It is to share their stories that I paint the portraits of the people I meet and hope to express something of our shared humanity. As part of my BA in History and Arabic at Durham University, I spent a year living abroad in Jordan. It was both the hardest and most incredible year of my life. Initially I felt overwhelmingly lonely arriving alone to an unknown city in a foreign culture. It was a struggle to communicate as I had only studied formal Arabic and not the local dialect. I learned the difference that a smile or a kind word from a stranger could make. While living in Jordan I was given an amazing opportunity by UNHCR to organise art projects with Syrian refugees, which were exhibited in Amman on World Refugee Day 2014.  For the art project, UNHCR refugee tents – a powerful symbol of displacement – were transformed into beautiful pieces of art, to raise awareness of the plight of refugees. These tents have since been exhibited in various European cities, including Geneva, Paris and London. I was touched by the warm affection from the refugees who took part in the art project and learned that you never become poor by giving. Therefore I returned to Jordan this April for another art project with refugee children in educational centres in Za'atari and Azraq camps. I have a deep love of the culture, customs and language of the Middle East and desire to seek understanding, especially in the current tense political climate which capitalises on accentuating difference and spreading fear. This September I will be beginning an MA at the Prince's School of Traditional Art in London. I seek to incorporate the beauty of Islamic art, poetry and calligraphy in her paintings, to celebrate the rich cultural heritage of the Middle East, so often forgotten and overshadowed by war."
367	Harinda	Sri Lanka	Sri Lanka	I	I	close	3768	3768	E	hc	male	I was born in Sri Lanka, and soon after my parents migrated to Italy where we stayed for 17 years. Then I moved to Canada, where I became a citizen. Ive been moving around ever since. Ive lived in the UK, the US, Ethiopia, Haiti, and have returned to Italy a few times. Now here I am—back in Sri Lanka. I moved here because I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur. It was always my biggest dream, but also my biggest fear. Sri Lanka gives you many advantages if you want to start a new business. There are strong professional networks, and the cost of capital is definitely less. On a couple of my earlier visits to Sri Lanka I had noticed the rapid pace of development, and thats when I decided that this is the place to be. Since moving here almost a year ago, I have encountered many challenges. There are stark differences from the other countries where I have lived. However, I understand that things work differently in different places. I like finding solutions. Ive set high milestones for my business here and I am determined to reach them. Being a successful entrepreneur is important to me because only then will I feel truly accomplished. I am not sure if I will stay in Sri Lanka though. In all my time travelling and living in different places, I learned to redefine myself, my friendships, and my notion of family. I am always testing and rediscovering new boundaries. I like the new. Im good at adapting and adopting cultures, but I still cant call one place home.
368	Haris Estrada	El Salvador	Canada	L	N	far	3799	43560	H	im	male	"When I decided come to live in Canada, I faced the fear of the unknown, starting from scratch in a country with a different language, a different climate and a long way from my family and friends; but, I decided to put aside sadness and nostalgia and meet life's challenges head on. I came to this country more than 13 years ago, when I was 25 years old, and just started my career as a professional. In El Salvador, access to employment was difficult and I had been waiting for a couple of months for a place as a radiologist in a Salvadoran Hospital, but the opportunity never came. This situation despaired me, because meant that so many years of study were useless. In those months, my mother raised the possibility of migrating to Canada as a resident. I had never considered living in another country before, but I felt that in El Salvador I could not make progress. I had a hard time at the beginning, because I had my dreams, the ones you had since childhood, studying, getting a good job, buying a house, helping my family. Here, things have not been easy, one of the main problems at the start was the language, and I thought I could speak English, but as soon as I got off the airplane, I knew I did not. My studies did not work either, although I tried to validate my degree, in college they told me that I had to start a career again. As I had to work I left my profession aside and dedicate myself to the construction, it was one of the hardest changes, going from an office job to a physical job, but I do not complain. Thanks to this job, I have been able to travel, to know many places and enjoy living conditions that would not have been there. When I think of El Salvador, it is inevitable to think about my friends, the beach, and coffee, but, above all, I think about my family. Here I learned the true value of the family; I think that if my mother did not live here and had not been from the beginning, I would not have endured being so far away. I brought my collection of coins that I started as a teenager, in high school. I thought that was the only thing of value he possessed. I imagined that here I would meet people from more countries and I assumed that I could increase my collection. Sometimes, when I feel that I do not belong to Canada, but I do not feel part of my country, then I talk to my sisters and my nephews and I see my collection and a couple of books that I brought with me and I find again the bond that unites me land. I do not know if I will return to El Salvador soon, but while I can help my family to get ahead, as a small way to repay what this country has given me."
369	Harry	United Kingdom	Thailand	E	I	far	40718	7189	L	im	male	"Im from Salisbury, a small city in the South of England. I moved to Bristol when I was 18 to study ancient history, with little idea of what kind of degree a job actually requires. After a while, what I was studying felt irrelevant and wanting to study something more pertinent, I pursued a masters in international development and security. I studied Yugoslavia as part of my course, so I applied for an internship in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I had initially planned to be there for six months, but ended up staying for five years. Bosnians are extremely welcoming, funny, and interested in why and how youve ended up there, as well as your opinion on the country. I loved talking about football and politics with the locals, two topics which always provoked debate. Bosnians are very open and upfront, which was initially a cultural shock; in the UK we often skirt around issues, particularly with colleagues. You always know where you stand with a Bosnian, a quality which I very much admire. My best friend there told me: Before I met you, I used to think all Brits were really stuck up. I hope I changed his mind! Living abroad certainly teaches you to appreciate other peoples points of view. Growing up in a small city in the UK, I had always felt detached from stories of war on the news, and I certainly had no reference point when I became good friends with people that had suffered genuine horrors during the conflicts in the 90s. I think the experience helped me grow as a person, but I could never pretend to even remotely understand the horrors that they had been through. I would have stayed longer had the opportunity to move to Thailand not come up. By then, Id fallen in love with Bosnia and Herzegovina. I had made a lot of friends, both Bosnian and foreign, and had found my niche in the city. I felt very comfortable there, but I think that was part of the problem – I felt too comfortable. The three cities that I had lived in prior to Bangkok have a combined population of less than a million, which pales in comparison to that of Bangkok. The sheer size of the city is daunting which made me feel a little lost for the first few months. Thailand is certainly an extremely beautiful country, but I think Ill need to be here for a long time to fully understand it. I do miss my friends and family. When something happens in the UK, Brexit being a prime example, all of my friends get together and talk about it – being away from home often makes me feel detached. The UK is still home for me, and I feel very lucky that I am able to return whenever I want, but I feel that recent issues have highlighted very real divisions in the country. I didnt think Id be a migrant in the long-term; I always imagined myself settling down in the UK, but now Im not so sure. However, Ive learned from living abroad never to make plans."
370	Harsh	India	Estonia	I	E	far	1931	23106	H	im	male	I lived in Scotland until I was four years old, but actually spent most of my childhood in Jamshedpur in East India where my dad worked as a doctor. I left India at the age of 22 to continue my studies as a software engineer in San Francisco. United States became my new home for the following twelve years. I was struck by the abundance of choice. I remember going in for an order of chicken sandwich at a fast food restaurant and then being presented with numerous options of bread, cheeses, vegetables and sauces - when in India I would have just gotten a chicken sandwich. By the time I could make my way through the list of possible options, a long line of people had formed behind me. After graduating I worked at eBay and PayPal, travelling a lot and building their products across continents. I now live in the UK, working mostly from TransferWises London office and spending a third of my time in the Estonian office. I didnt really have any preconceptions about Estonia other than having heard from a previous colleague that Tallinn was a beautiful city. So I can testify that people turn to stereotypes when theyre confronted with new cultures. I had done some research on Estonia, but the first time I landed in Tallinn I was still relying on a rather Americanised view of the Soviet region. In the end it turned out to be one of the easiest travel experiences in my life. Ive observed that people from the same background tend to have similar innate biases and so they approach problems in a similar way, confirming each other's opinions. Diversity helps build better products for the world. I think migration and movement of people across borders have the obvious benefits of helping people build better lives for themselves and help countries with talent infusion, innovation and driving economies forward. They also help build a better world as we understand each others cultures and beliefs and make everyone more open to different viewpoints. This in the long run will hopefully lead to a more tolerant and peaceful world as well see people from different countries not as Estonians or Indians or Americans but more as independent individuals.
371	Hasan	Syrian Arab Republic	Italy	M	E	far	890	31238	H	im	male	My name is Hasan. I come from Syria and I am 31 years old. I am a landscape architect. I had to leave Syria because I was asked to do military service and I refused. I didnt want to kill anybody from any side. So I decided to escape and leave the country and the war and to save my small family - my wife Nour and my child Ziad. We used to live in a small village, 35 km from Damascus, called Wadi Barada. We miss a lot of things - our friends, our relatives, our memories, our favorite places, all of the interesting things that exist in Syria. We miss them all. It was very hard to leave Syria and we had to do it illegally, as my name was in all the police stations because of the military service. I was wanted. So we had to leave with a smuggler who took us through hostile territory. We arrived in Aleppo and we stayed there six days, and then another smuggler put us in a small bus and we crossed the border with Turkey. We have a lot of dreams for Syria, dreams of peace. We hope the situation will get better. We know it is complicated now. It is not easy but we have the hope. My hope here in Italy, for me, for my family, for my son especially, is to live in peace, to simply have the type of life we had before in our country. Everything has changed because of the war, especially the prices of food. For example, before the war one litre of milk was 15 Syrian lira. After the war, in some areas, the price had risen to 250 Syrian lira and also there are some areas where one litre of milk can reach 200.000 Syrian lira – because there is no milk, no cows, and no goats. There is nothing. This is a just small example but there are so many stories like this. Everything has changed because of the war.
372	Hassan	Afghanistan	Afghanistan	I	I	close	508	508	E	hc	male	In 2016, Hasan was working in a metal workshop in Afghanistan. Around this time he decided to go abroad, hoping for a better future and a higher income. His initial plan was to go to Switzerland. His journey from Afghanistan to Europe was dotted with many difficulties, as he was travelling irregularly. He made it to Greece where he spent almost eight months, unable to move on to Switzerland. He was fully aware of the risks for people moving irregularly across Europe – which can be fatal in some cases. So, instead, he opted to return back to his country and join his family, with the support of IOM. Upon his arrival, he decided to invest in a metal workshop in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. He decided to approach his former boss, a metal smith who he had worked with before leaving for Europe, hoping that he would be interested in starting a business together. With the assistance of IOM Offices in Greece and Afghanistan, the plan became reality. Hasan owns now 50 percent of the business' shares and the workshop is located near his home. Together with his partner, they produce a variety of metal products such as window frames, doors, fences, etc. His net income is approximately 200 EUR per month. He spends 28 EUR on rent, while also providing for his family. Thanks to his previous experience and motivation, he has learned all of his businesss activities very quickly and now is a qualified metal smith. Hasan is very happy with his life and the expansion of the business, as well: the two partners have already hired a worker for their workshop and they plan to start another metal workshop in a different area of Kabul, in order to have more clients and increase their income.
373	Hassan	Ethiopia	Ethiopia	A	A	close	840	840	E	hc	male	In 2015, Hassan made the difficult decision to migrate to Yemen from his home in Hararge, Ethiopia in search of a better life for him and his family. I was aware of the risks and dangers of being smuggled across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen, and I left behind my wife and five children, Hassan said,I hoped the risks would pay off and I could better support my family by sending money and eventually returning home with some savings. Hassan made contact with well-established migrant smuggling networks that said they would take him to Yemen, but first he had to meet them in Somalia.  He left his home and joined a group of like-minded migrants. They moved clandestinely bypassing police check-points and immigration officials at the border crossing. Aside from occasionally hiding in trucks, Hassan made his journey on foot. After finally reaching the coast of northern Somalia, all Hassan could do was wait for instructions from the smugglers. In early January, 2016, his group was ready to depart. A wooden boat gathered 106 migrants and departed for Yemen from a remote beach. All was well, until a malfunction with the boats engine left them stranded at sea. When rough weather hit after a week of drifting, the boat capsized—leaving thirty six dead in its wake. Luckily, Hassan was one of the seventy people that survived. Many people died, Hassan said, some of their bodies disappeared, and others were recovered.  While the boat was stalled we received no assistance and didnt see any other boats, despite our distress. We did not have a means of communication to call for help. Eventually, other boats and government officials came to the aid of the survivors-- dehydrated emaciated and many needing medical attention. IOM worked closely with the survivors and officials in Somaliland and Ethiopia to secure travel documents, basic assistance. Later, they provided transportation and reintegration support to Hassan and the other 63 migrants willing to return to Ethiopia. Through the window of one of the buses going bringing him back to Ethiopia, Hassan said, I will never go back to Yemen and will tell everyone not to try irregular migration. Hassan intends to stay in Ethiopia with his wife and children and look for a job in Western Hararge. He said, Despite the challenges of supporting my family with limited employment opportunities, it is much better than the hardship I went through in trying to reach Yemen.
374	Hassan	Iraq	Croatia	M	E	far	4146	13934	E	im	male	Hassan is a veterinary expert who was forced to leave his home country because of the war. He used to have a veterinary clinic and is specialized in providing medical care to horses and cattle. Hassan left for Turkey and then was smuggled on a boat to Greece. From there he continued his journey to Macedonia, went through the Balkans route and arrived to Sweden where he has relatives. After spending two months in Sweden where he applied for Asylum he received a rejection and thus had to get deported back to Croatia. He decided to apply for asylum in Croatia a months ago and is hoping he will be able to stay and work in Croatia. In anticipation he has already started to explore possibilities to open a veterinary clinic. In the meantime, he volunteers and helps other migrants with translation and interpretation because he is fluent in English.
375	Hassan	Morocco	Mauritania	A	A	close	3108	1702	E	im	male	"Hassan is a Moroccan trader. As many other Moroccans, he exports spices and cosmetic products around West Africa. He arrived in Mauritania in November 2012 with the idea of opening a boutique with his family. Before taking the decision to migrate, I visited Mauritania to conduct a market survey. What I have found is a virgin country where still a lot can be done. On the other side, Morocco is a country rich in resources, most of which are lacking in Mauritania, so what I do is promoting the exchange between the two countries. After his arrival, it took Hassan one year to open his first shop. I know a lot of people from Morocco, Tunisia, or Turkey who started an activity here and after one year had to leave the country. Although he had some problems at the beginning as well, Hassan did well enough for his business to flourish and managed to open a new and bigger shop. It is a chance that my family is here. In the morning we open at 7 a.m. and then close at midnight, I could never have done this alone. When you are not in your country, you dont know anybody at the beginning; so it is good to have someone close to you, someone who can make you feel home. In the future Hassan would like to do something for his country, something to improve its economy. The positive aspect of migration is that you get to know other countries, cultures, expertise, people, their way of eating, thinking, living, etc.; so many things from which something special can rise. You get to know the world! I gave what I could to this country, but I have also learnt a lot from it. I know how to cope with solitude and that we do not need much to be happy."
376	Hazem Emam	Egypt	Egypt	A	A	close	3609	3609	E	hc	male	On 19 September 2017, the UN Migration Agency (IOM) and the National Coordinating Committee on Combatting and Preventing Illegal Migration and Trafficking in Persons (NCCPIM&TIP) launched a national awareness raising campaign on irregular migration of Egyptian youth and children. The campaign, titled Your Family, Your Dream, Your Life aims to sensitize Egyptian youth to the risks of irregular migration journeys, using a combination of digital and traditional media to maximize reach and impact. Under the leadership of NCCPIM&TIP, IOM Egypt developed a video featuring Egyptian international footballer Hazem Emam, to inform children and youth and their families about the risks involved in attempting sea migration journeys. The national media campaign under the slogan Your Family, Your Dream, Your Life sends an appeal through a TV advertisement featuring Hazem Emam, who sends a message to the youth and their families on the dangers of irregular immigration and that solutions exist and come from within us through hard work, perseverance and initiative, said Ambassador Naela Gabr, the Chairperson of NCCPIM&TIP.
377	Heba	Egypt	Estonia	A	E	far	3609	23106	H	im	female	I first heard about Estonia through a friend. When searching for post graduate studies, I was intrigued by the studies in international relations and diplomacy at the Estonian School of Diplomacy. My previous experience in Egypt was with media monitoring, elections, and human rights. At the Egyptian cabinet I worked with media monitoring projects. I was responsible for media monitoring and election projects at the Andalus Institute for Tolerance and Anti Violence Studies. I led a team who monitored media during the elections to see whether media were biased, we put recommendations to media outlets to improve their performance and gave advice on how to be more neutral. Working with the civil society sector was an eye-opening experience as I was working with human rights, tolerance issues and Syrian refugees. I realized that some people really dont have any future and they need to look for better opportunities, its not something we can use against them. Many Estonians also go abroad searching for better chances. For me the question is why is it good for people from Europe to move within Europe, but bad when people from Middle East or Asia look for jobs in Europe? Ive seen that immigrants enrich their new societies. They are like teachers, because through interaction with immigrants locals learn open-mindedness and tolerance toward cultural differences. Also, if immigrants are employed they benefit the economic cycle. Migration consists of normal people, some are good and some are bad. When someone does something it is because they are bad, not because they are from a specific place. We need to judge peoples acts according to the law. Through my work and volunteering experiences I have learned to look beyond stereotypes. My thinking began to change when I saw that different ideas, thoughts and people will not cause me any harm. If I had a very limited mentality, I dont think I would be very successful in bringing change through my work. In the future I hope to work with human rights and torture issues. I hope to make a difference in peoples lives and help them understand that human rights are not a luxury, but vital to being human. In Egypt its not easy to convince people that human rights are part of your essential rights. I hope to make this shift in thinking. It is hard to change what the whole society thinks, but at least I can start with myself and know what I believe.
378	Heldana	Ethiopia	Belgium	A	E	far	840	45028	H	im	female	"My dad moved to the US from Ethiopia in 1998 when the border war broke out between the two countries. At that time, Eritreans were no longer welcome in Ethiopia. I was born in the US, but because I didnt grow up there, I consider myself Ethiopian and Eritrean.  My dad returned to the US with my siblings soon after the start of the war while my mom and I stayed in Ethiopia. It was difficult to leave her when I moved to the US in my late teens because I was the last one of my siblings to live with her. She refused to move because she was happy with her life in Ethiopia. There wasnt much of a culture shock moving back to the US because I had spent every summer and Christmas there. Washington DC also has a strong Ethiopian community, so I was never really far from the culture or the food. They even sell our food at 7/11, its that common. But I did miss my friends and the place where I grew up – my culture and feeling comfortable speaking my own language, Amharic. I was also used to middle-class life in Ethiopia, which included having a maid, a guard, a driver, etc. These things are considered luxurious in Western countries but its the norm for some in Ethiopia. Balancing my Ethiopian and Eritrean identities was also difficult. Sometimes Eritreans can be anti-Ethiopia because of the war and what the Ethiopian government did to them. Growing up, as long as I hid my Ethiopian heritage I was kind of accepted. But at the same time, a lot of people spent the summers going to Eritrean youth camps as part of a government initiative, so they knew each other and spoke the language and I didnt. I never felt like I belonged to the Eritrean community. After my dad passed away, I wanted to be more Eritrean and bond with that culture more because I knew it would have meant a lot to him. The whole war was based on identity; thats what Eritreans fought for. Its strange living in Belgium because most people label me as American. I never know which response to give when someone asks me where I am from. I eventually want to settle in Ethiopia, especially after having conducted my field research on the driving forces behind the Ethiopian diasporas return from the US. I am essentially trying to find out what encourages people to move back home. There is a huge disparity between the poor and the 1%, but people now are working harder to close that gap. We are privileged enough to leave and get an education, have these different experiences in different cultures, and now we can contribute to the countrys growth and development in the long-run. If you have the right motivation, its a great time to be in Ethiopia."
379	Heni	Indonesia	Australia	I	O	far	3870	55823	H	im	female	I am a very passionate Aerobics and Zumba instructor. I worked as a marketing manager and aerobics instructor for over 20 years in my home city Bali, Indonesia. I love the vibe of the city – it's alive 24/7. I miss the food, my friends and of course my family. When I first came to Australia I settled in a very small and quiet place. I didnt know anyone in town! I was feeling lonely, but I had my son around that same time and he also made me feel brave, along with my faith. One day I decided to be strong and use my talents to connect with people. I started a Zumba class and I was surprised at how many people attended without even knowing me. I realised I could connect with people through Zumba. So I put my name on a website and updated my social media accounts to promote my work. A few months later I was contacted by a gym in Goulburn - a town close to where I was living - and they offered me a job! I was surprised that the word had spread out about my work. So I took the job and travelled to work a few days a week. Soon, I met some people from the Goulburn Multicultural Centre and I offered to volunteer and teach a Zumba class. The stories of the men and women that came along to the class inspired me and I wanted to do as much as I could to be of help. I knew how hard the journey was, I had lived through it myself. Soon after, I decided to move to Goulburn to be closer to work and the multicultural centre. I got so involved in the multicultural centre that I ended up taking a full time position and left my job at the gym. I also studied for a Certificate in Community Services. I still lead a Zumba class at the Multicultural Centre but Im also focused on other projects such as the women's support group, sowing classes, computer classes, driving lessons, support with homework for those studying and support for people seeking jobs. I now run the centre along with 22 volunteers and with their support, over 100 people of all ages and backgrounds have connected with the centre. The Zumba class is a popular activity at the multicultural centre. Zumba makes people feel healthy and confident, and it brings everyone together. We dont only invite migrants, but locals too. It helps migrants feel welcome and it helps the locals to understand migrants and their background. When we are in a Zumba class people feel happy, no one feels different because we are all just exercising through dance. We realise that were are all the same.

Migration has been a path to opportunity for me, but I've never lost sight of the fact that it can be a challenge for many others. It's important for me to do something about this with direct actions: I once paid a stamp duty for a Tamil refugee trying to go from Paris to London. Understandably, gestures like aren't possible for everyone all the time, but I think there is a lot of advice that could be helpful in the meantime. For those who choose to move, I would urge them to be careful of staying isolated, to forge trustworthy contacts that can help in difficult situations and to respect the rules of the home they are invited into.
381	Henrik	United States	Finland	N	E	far	63123	48685	E	im	male	My dad's side of the family moved to the United States in the 1950s. The situation in Finland was grim after the Winter War, and the New World presented my grandfather with a promising opportunity to fulfill his dreams as a business owner. The family settled in Michigan where my grandfather sold Finnish skis while my dad helped with his father's carpentry business. It was there that my mother later met my dad while visiting from Finland for an English language camp. I am a third-generation migrant and a dual citizen. In 2009 I moved back to Northern Ostrobothnia, in Finland, where both my grandparents used to reside. I currently work as an English teacher, sharing my story while substituting at local schools. When Finland had an influx of migrants in 2015, the country was ill-prepared. As a country that is somewhat isolated in the north, citizens have become accustomed to the benefits associated with Nordic welfare states. Sharing that wealth with others has now meant making compromises. In education, for example, that has meant that everyone can no longer study everything they are interested in for free. On the job market, there has been increased discussion about entrepreneurship and a gradual move away from tenureship, particularly in the field of education. Times are changing and it is time for us to get creative — together. This is what makes us human.
382	Hervé	Cote d'Ivoire	Chad	A	A	close	2318	679	E	im	male	Passionate, devoted, energetic, and motivated, these are words that describe Hervé, a young migrant from Burkina Faso whose mission is to raise awareness on the harsh reality of irregular migration. After losing multiple friends to the dangerous journey to Europe, he created Mably Inter an association which utilizes his own talents as an artist to spread messages on the reality of what really happens when trying to reach Europe. When we are young, we are taught everything is better in Europe, do your best so one day you can make it to Europe, the idea of migration is put in our mind as children he expresses when explaining factors that contribute to African youth taking the chance to embark on the journey. In recognition of the phenomenon, claiming the lives of many, he promotes the message And what if I Stay  four powerful words that encourage youth in particular to think twice before taking the dangerous risk. Today, his efforts have developed a network of like-minded individuals working to spread the message in Cameroon, the Ivory Coast and Morocco. Hervé hopes to expand the network throughout Africa, to raise awareness among the youth that Europe is not their only option to be successful.
383	Hiba and Adel	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	n	"Hiba and Adel are a newlywed couple living in a small single room apartment in a well-known refugee neighbourhood in Gaziantep, Turkey. Adel, 26, used to work as a chef in Raqqa before coming to Turkey 1.5 years ago. I always loved to cook. When I was a kid I would always help out my parents and relatives in the kitchen. When I got older, I started to work in kitchens in restaurants, says Adel. I knew early on that I wanted to open up a restaurant of my own. Things changed for him quickly once ISIL came and took over Raqqa. It was not too bad at first, but once they gained control of the city they began closing down all of the shops. Thats how I lost my job and couldnt make more money. After that things got much worse. Then they started the public executions and beheadings. I cant even remember how many people I saw killed in front of me. It got to the point that all the good memories I had living there were ruined by the horrors that I saw there. I left the city while I still had the chance to do so. Hiba, 24, was a nursing student in Aleppo when the war began. Her love for medicine began at an early age when she would spend time helping out in a medical laboratory and maternity clinic. Im fascinated by the whole subject. I really do hope to be able to finish what I started one day so I can work as a nurse. As the war raged on in Aleppo, Hiba and her family eventually fled to Gaziantep nine months ago. While living in Turkey, their families eventually crossed paths and their marriage was arranged. I was so nervous when I first met him. I knew nothing about him, laughs Hiba. Adel also recounts nervous jitters when he first met his wife-to-be I knew that we didnt have to marry if we didnt like each other when we met but once I set my eyes on her I knew she was the one. Happily in love, the two had a modest ceremony with close family members, all of whom were from Hibas family. I have no family here, my family is still trapped in Raqqa and I havent heard from them in months. Now they face a new problem together; finding affordable housing. I used to work here in a local restaurant in Gaziantep but the owner was not paying me very much and gradually started paying me me less and less until he simply stopped. I couldnt keep working like that. As they struggle with paying the rent with no work, IOM has been providing the couple with rental assistance. The help is greatly appreciated. It has given us some time to breathe and my husband to find new work and I can find a way to resume my studies."

385	Hiyfat, Sara and Muhammad	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	n	Hiyfat is walking up and down restlessly, peeking through the windows of the administration building in the refugee accommodation centre of Trikala, central Greece. In a few hours, two of her three children, Sara and Muhammad, 10 and 9 respectively, will go back to school for the first time in years and IOM staff is here to register the new pupils and to distribute school kits. Anticipation is in the air. Im really happy for my children as I believe education is very important Hiyfat says. Its been ten moths we are in Greece and in the meantime, I have tried to teach them on my own everything I can, while trying to improve my English, as well. Hiyfat has escaped Aleppo together with her husband and 3 children more than a year ago. The family arrived on the island of Lesbos and moved around various camps across Greece before finally settling here, four months ago. People are nice here in Trikala, we have made friends. However, I think its in the best interest of my family to move to Holland or to Norway, where we also have relatives. Sara and Muhammad are buzzing around their mom as they wait to get their colourful bags. I have been to school for one year, back in Syria, Sara says. I love that Im starting again, I would like to study English, to learn every language in the world! It would be nice to do some drawing and to make new friends, too. Muhammad is a little more reserved: Im looking forward to go to school tomorrow, but I want to see how I turns out before I say anything, I dont know whether Ill like or not. I miss the classroom but I would really love to play some football.
386	Hokheng	Cambodia	Cambodia	I	I	close	1513	1513	E	hc	male	Twenty years ago I made the biggest decision in my life: leave the only place I had ever known. I knew I would miss my parents and my siblings, but I had the belief that by pursuing opportunities in Thailand I could make a bigger contribution to my family in the future. Once in Thailand I started working in a private company. I then met the woman I decided to marry. That was the beginning of a new chapter of my life. My mother-in-law owned a Thai restaurant in Bangkok. I quit my job at the company and decided to work with my new family. I learned how to cook Thai food, speak Thai and develop my skills to manage a restaurant as a business, including how to train my staff. Initially our restaurant did quite well, but as time passed there were more competitors joining the market. Thats when my wife and I began discussing the next chapter in our life, and we decided to open a Thai restaurant in Cambodia, my country. I had not lived in Cambodia for 20 years and the changes were beyond my expectations. Even though I am Cambodian, I felt like a migrant once again. Looking back, I would not change my decision to migrate. I have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience that has changed me for the better as a person.  I am now using this experience and sharing the skills I learned with my homeland. To my twenty year old younger self, I say thank you as the decision to migrate has enriched my life and I hope I can now give this back to Cambodia.
387	Hratch & Sosy	Syrian Arab Republic	Armenia	M	I	far	890	4266	E	im	n	Its been two years and it is noticeable how our childrens inner-world, their mentality has changed. Before, if asked to draw something, they would draw blood, rockets, bullets, fire and tanks. Now they draw butterflies, spring, a metro etc. Their inner world has changed.  Sosy and Hratch are happy with their decision to move to Armenia from Aleppo, Syria  two years ago, mainly for the sake of their children, aged seven and nine. Despite being of Armenian origin, the decision to move and integrating into their new lives is not always easy. We miss our Armenian community in Syria they say. There are differences in the Armenian we are used to speaking in Syria, and the Armenian spoken here. Russian words are used regularly in conversation, particularly when it comes to technical terms says Hratch who works as turner and recently set up his own business. Starting a business from scratch is hard work and requires a lot of patience. I have even set up a Facebook page (Tokar Hratch Dabbaghian) in order to showcase my work and get new clients. I have always wanted to come to Armenia to study, and now I have a year left to complete my masters degree in linguistics. I had to get used to the differences in the language, and even had to change advisors at the university due to the communication barrier. I am used to it now says Sosy. She misses working in Armenia, but is focusing on her studies for now, which helps to take her mind off the difficulties they face. Despite the challenges, they are happy to have escaped the conflict in Syria, even though they miss it. It has been hard for the children too. They were teased at school because of the language differences. But now they have slowly gotten used to the language and have made friends at school. The difference in them is noticeable. We knew that if we left Syria, we would go to Armenia. We want our children to grow up in an Armenian community. If only we were not faced with financial worries and difficulties in finding employment, Armenia would be a heavenly place they say.
388	Hugh	New Zealand	Bulgaria	O	E	far	43972	10058	E	im	male	The age old expression – When in Rome, do as the Romans do always applies when moving to a new country, especially in Bulgaria. After spending the past 12 years here full time, I already feel half Bulgarian. Bulgarians are a unique breed of people. They may not be the first to welcome you with a smile, but they will certainly send you away with one. On the most part they are very genuine, which is one of the countrys most desirable attractions – the people. My home country is New Zealand but I have lived a transient life from a young age living in Australia, Europe, the UK and the Philippines. I love traveling and getting to know new countries. What is interesting for me in each place is the soul of the country. When I go somewhere I watch how people interact with each other, and with me. It is really about getting to know the people and the family environment, the values. Bulgaria for example is very strong on family values, family always comes first. Moving for me is always exciting. Learning how to read a new language, interpreting street signs, understanding the nuances of the land. Some of the easiest things like getting keys cut can be some of the most challenging – but are often the most entertaining experiences. We learn a lot about ourselves when sign language and a smile here and there is the only way to communicate. In the first days of arriving in Bulgaria, I went into a restaurant and ordered chicken soup, the waitress nodded fervently yes, so I waited. 30 minutes had passed, although hungry and starting to get temperamental like most hungry guys are known for, I smiled at the waitress and she smiled back but no sign of the soup. I did not want to be rude, so I waited patiently another 15 minutes and then asked. The waitress again nodded yes and I felt it was a yes in the way yes, it is coming. After 1 hour and about to eat the table cloth, I started making signs of a chicken with a questioning look, only to be kindly told by the Bulgarians at the table beside me that her very active yes was in fact a fervent no! Bulgarians say no by nodding their heads as we would say yes! I founded an IT company three years ago that develops loyalty and marketing automation software. We are expanding our product into the USA this year and hope to be active in South East Asia next year.
389	Huong	Viet Nam	Germany	I	E	far	2786	45909	H	im	female	I came to Germany at the very last day of 1996. We had taken a flight from Vietnam to Hungary and then continued the journey on foot. The journey was intense. We walked through the snow at night, for six hours until we crossed the border. I was hungry and cold. But our journey wasnt over. Through paths, bushes and tunnels we finally got to a house, were we had been awaited. I was ten years old and surprised. Nobody had really explained to me where we would be going to. My mum had just said that we were going on a journey, but not how special and exhausting that journey would be. But it was planned that we would go to join my father, who had already gone to Germany five years earlier. We only reached Germany at the second attempt. The first time we were arrested in Hungary and ended up in prison. My mother was crying a lot, but eventually we made it. All these experiences made me strong and are part of my story. After a few weeks, I started school. The first day of school was intense. I was nervous and could not speak German. But the other children in this first school were great. They welcomed me with open arms. A key moment to me was a conversation with a friend, a few weeks after I arrived. I wanted to tell her that I liked a boy from our class, but I didnt know how to express myself. Then and there I realised I had to learn this language as quickly as possible. I want to be understood. From that moment on, the German language became a part of me. To Germany I brought hope and the open-mindedness to look at things and accept them as they are. I am open towards new situations. At the same time I always had to fight a little bit harder, therefore I have the spirit to work hard for things that are dear to me. For example I work for projects with children. To me, Vietnam is still home. Therefore next year Im planning to spend a few months there. However, I dont consider it as a return, its rather another step on my journey through life.
390	Hussein	Iraq	Belgium	M	E	far	4146	45028	H	im	male	"I left Iraq for many reasons. I lost my parents and my brother-in-law a few years ago, and it is hard to be a musician in Iraq. My mind had already left before I decided to move. The last two to three years I read a lot of books just trying to understand how everything works abroad. I was deciding between Finland and Belgium. Until a friend of mine told me Go to Brussels, it will suit you. It took me 12 days to get here. I took a plane to Turkey followed by a boat to Greece. There, starting from Athens I walked from border to border. From Greece to Macedonia, further to Serbia then followed by Hungary. In Budapest I took a taxi with three other people, each paying 500 Euros to reach Brussels. During the trip, everybody was complaining about many things, it was cold and people were scared. However, I was happy most of the time. I felt like there was a big light shining ahead of me, a new life was waiting for me. For me it is very hard to survive in Belgium, especially because of the different cultures. I have seen a lot of Iraqis who returned voluntarily because they couldn't adapt. I don't really miss Iraq that much though. When I hear news about Iraq I think about my country and sometimes it affects me, but I am really focused on finding my way here, especially for my music career. Even though Ive only been here for six months, I feel at home, especially in Brussels. In a way it feels like Baghdad to me, which I love. I loved going to Baghdad back in Iraq; I went there almost on a daily basis. I don't really know which country I would call home. They both mean a lot to me. I had a hard time building a life in Iraq and I eventually had to leave but home will always remain home even if at some point it was horrible. One day I will go back, but maybe more as a visit. The first week after my arrival in Brussels I started working in the Maximilaan Park where I met a woman who introduced me to the Refugee for Refugee project. I now have several concerts ahead. There are a lot of new exciting things coming my way, musical performances and theater. Sometimes I feel like there are too many good things happening here and it scares me."
391	Chaker	Lebanon	Canada	M	N	far	9310	43560	E	im	unisex	"I was born and raised up in Bourj El Barajneh refugee camp in Lebanon - a one kilometer square camp with broken roads, no regular electricity or water, and crammed with human beings. The houses were so close to each other that people had no choice but be bound together. We became like one big family. I felt trapped and I was determined to leave this open jail. My parents taught me that the only way to get out of this misery was through education and hard work. Our luck was that many volunteers from Canada, US, Australia, and Europe came to teach us English. They were our window to the world. So with their help, I learnt English, acted in plays and read books. I always dreamt of studying abroad to become a normal human being as I called it back then. Then, an internet cafe opened in the camp. There were two or three computers, and a very slow internet connection. Thanks to the many Canadian volunteers coming into the camp, Canada became my dream. I would spend hours looking at universities over there and applying. I eventually found out that York University in Toronto offered scholarships for foreign students. I applied, got accepted and was granted the Global Leader of Tomorrow Award because my grades in school were good enough and I had a strong community involvement. When I arrived in Canada, I almost felt Canadian. I could finally see and smell freedom. I felt free, I felt. normal. After a few years I could finally apply for Canadian  citizenship. And so I became Canadian. At the citizenship ceremony, the judge told me: Now you have a country. Now you have a home. I started to cry. Holding the passport made me feel that the world would be mine from now on; I could go anywhere I wanted, even to my homeland, Palestine. My visa applications would not be rejected anymore, I could travel! I hope my experience means that refugees can say: I can do it too.  I want every stateless person not to give up on their dreams because it is my dreams and determination that saved me from a hard life. Hopefully, this Award can also inspire countries and people worldwide not to simply think of refugees as victims that need charity but rather as people who would contribute when given the chance. People cant imagine what it is to be a refugee or to be stateless. Refugees are ordinary people living in extraordinary circumstances; give them a chance and they will excel and become someone. Refugees are dreamers determined to make something out of nothing, and our world can truly benefit from this energy."
392	Chanwut	Thailand	Singapore	I	I	close	7189	58114	H	im	male	I left my native Thailand for Singapore in seach of job opportunities, eventually finding work as a lawyer. Thanks to the people I encounter through my employment, and having undergone the experience of migration myself, I have come to understand how it can mean freedom for so many people. I try to help where I can with donations because I know that, amongst other things, migration can have serious financial implications for those who chose to do it. Some families have to sell everything they have to fund their journey, making the first part of their arrival in a new place that much harder. When I think about the things that helped me when I first came to Singapore, I would urge anyone who undertakes a big move away from home to adapt and assimilate into the local culture in their new home. Get away from your community and comfort zone as much as possible! It's not always as scary as it might seem. Learning about the local culture is important, and it helps to try doing things the local way — this requires a certain level of open mindedness. But this doesn't mean that you have to lose your sense of self.
393	Charles	France	Honduras	E	L	far	38959	2406	L	im	male	The most important thing for me is to have a happy family. That is why we decided to come to Honduras. My wife and I met in Marseille (France). She studied there, but it wasnt easy as a Honduran to find a job when she finished. We didnt think much of it: in Honduras, she could work as a dentist and I would try to find something to do. That was the challenge. I used to say: I cant imagine being in a place without working. And I was very lucky because I got a job offer very quickly in an educational institution, based on a previous working experience in France. My friends say that Im like a cat who always lands on his feet. Its been three years now. This period is not enough to evaluate the country, but I do feel that Honduras has a great potential and it has very talented people who can make things change. I do miss my family, my friends. And I also miss the music. Im someone who needs to play, to create. In Tegucigalpa, the city where we live, I missed that. I was looking for musicians to start a jazz band, but it is often difficult to find people who share your vision. Luckily, a few months ago I found the ideal people and we started a group, French Quartet. My family, my job and the music are the three reasons that make up a very positive personal balance - despite living in a country with high levels of violence and with lots of people having a hard time. But I also feel that we can all build a country where things work out better. Together, cooperating. In short, we are here building a house and creating a home.
394	Charles	Sierra Leone	Australia	A	O	far	475	55823	H	im	male	"The war had destroyed my country and forced me to flee Sierra Leone in 2000. I had to live in a refugee camp in Ghana. It was hard leaving my country. In Ghana it was difficult to buy things because if you are a foreigner, prices increase, so food was expensive. It was hard to communicate because I didnt speak the language. I was very happy when finally my name came up to start a new life in a new country. What we had been hearing about was mainly America; Australia was not a country that I heard much about in Africa. Even then when Australia came up it, was a joyous moment. I came to Australia in 2009 alone, but in 2013 I was able to bring my wife, my mum, my sister and my mother in law. I now have a 14 month baby and my wife is pregnant. Australia has been more than we expected. It was great to move here. I am now a public servant, Youth Worker in Canberra. I have also been able to engage and bring African culture to Canberra through the steering committee of the National Multicultural Office, bringing drumming and dance activities. It has given me an opportunity to showcase my talents and make a difference in my community. In addition to the cultural promotion, I also have pastoral meetings with my community and impart my knowledge to young people. This is my contribution to Australia. In the future I would like to be able to settle down and have peace and stability back home and impart what I have learned in Australia and make a difference there. I dont know when or if that will happen, maybe my kids will get to see a changed country and they can carry this vision forward."
395	Charles	United States	Norway	N	E	far	63123	66871	E	im	male	Im from New York, and Ive pretty much been traveling for 30 years. I lived all over the world from Greenland, to the Republic of Georgia, to the Czech Republic, where I usually work at universities. I never really considered myself a migrant before. I was an expatriate and usually I would be at place for two years and get bored with it and move on. I can move through borders relatively easily, but then something happened.  I was in Greenland, but I found it very difficult there, so I went to Norway for a vacation and much to my surprise, I met a man. He is the kindest, nicest and sweetest man I have ever met. Eight months after coming to Norway, we were married. When people think of migrants they now think of rubber boats, poor drowned children and desperate people trying to cross the border. There are also migrants who can move relatively freely around the world without much hassle and because of your birthright. Being an American, and speaking English as my first language, I can basically go where I want. My country, and my American identity, is built on migration. Migrants are people that find their happiness, or safety, livelihood or who they are, in other places in the world. When I got to Norway, I couldn't work and I couldn't travel for six months. I basically felt stateless for six months. It really scared me. I was never in that position before and it humbled me. I had to rely on my husband for financial support, which was devastating. I suffered but am glad I stuck it out.  . What I brought with me are traditions, like Halloween or Thanksgiving, and Valentine's Day.  People want those experiences after seeing them through American media. Theyre fun traditions to share, and keeps me in touch with my identity. Being a migrant means you have to focus on what's real, and what your situation is. You can't replace the past.
396	Chieko	Japan	United States	I	N	far	39990	63123	E	im	female	"My newlywed parents arrived in the US during the autumn of 1974 with two suitcases full of fashion forward clothing, osenbe (rice crackers) and a set of 30 Japanese encyclopedias. My mother immigrated to the US with my father, who was earlier drafted into the US army as a paratrooper in the Vietnam War and was being relocated from Camp Zama, Japan, to Fort Ord in California. My grandparents, who had lived through World War I and II, werent entirely thrilled about their daughter moving to the US with a member of the US army. To them, the US was considered an enemy due to the 'oppressive' nature of the government and the misinformation being drilled into its citizens. However, their view of the US gradually changed as my mother and father grasped onto opportunity, went to college, and worked towards maintaining successful professions. When asked about my grandparents changing perspective about Japan-US relations, my mother exclaimed, 'My parents' view of America changed when they saw that I was happy and I was taking every opportunity I could get. Isnt that what being a parent is about? Wanting your child to be happy no matter how painful for you it is to see them go? My grandmother proceeded to visit the US seven times until the age of 80, especially during the years when I was an infant. My mother still holds onto her set of Japanese encyclopedias bestowed upon her by her parents during her high school years despite their low income. When asked about their importance, she says, Well, I dont want to lose it so I hold onto it. I like to have it; its nothing dramatic! However, these books function as a connection back to my mothers roots – to her parents and to the land where she grew up."
397	Chih-Wei	China	Germany	I	E	far	10229	45909	E	im	female	Ive travelled a lot and lived in many different countries. Being originally from Taiwan, I migrated to Australia when I was 30, because the working conditions in Taiwan are really bad. A few years later, while travelling, I fell in love with a German – hence now Im here. I am very flexible as to where to live since I can work online and can communicate easily with my family through modern technology, hence I dont miss them too much. My husband could not work in Australia, so we decided to stay here. What I like here is that everything here is not crazy on capitalism. Therefore people seem nicer and common goods are better taken care off. Germany is great for me. I feel it is more inclusive and people in general have more respect to others of different social classes. Additionally, Berlin has thousands of parkland, and many playgrounds. It is a city that is perfectly designed for people to live in and raise children. My hometown Taipei in comparison has very few parkland and small parks and life is very stressful without lots of nature around. In Berlin there is also very good public transportation, and cultural infrastructure. Such as the many museums, the opera house, concert house and theatres. Bureaucracy here is tricky to handle. I found that what makes Germany efficient is people following rules (at work not really in private), which are thoughtfully designed. The bad thing is, those who execute them dont seem to care if there is room for improvements. In every occasion that I had to deal with German bureaucracy, for example, when we wanted to get married, a lot of documents were actually redundant. In the end, we got married in Denmark. Its like the Las Vegas of Europe. Migration is a hot topic at the moment in Germany, and although I dont feel directly affected by a lot of these debates, I watch them closely. I certainly find Germans, in general, care a lot about human rights. But Im afraid large scale migration always leads to fear and this is just human nature. Not everyone in a society is in a position to share resources with others and not everyone is educated enough to differentiate fact and fears. So I hope the political climate is not turning further right-wing and anti-immigrants.
398	Chik Aljoy	Zimbabwe	South Africa	A	A	close	1466	5094	E	im	male	Im originally from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. I arrived in South Africa in 2011 when I was 15 to complete my high school studies. I was brought here by my aunt and lived with her in Johannesburg. My mother passed away in 2001, my father still lives in Zimbabwe. At the beginning, it was kind of strange to be in South Africa, because I was trying to adapt to a new country, learn new languages. In Zimbabwe, we only have three main official languages, but in South Africa there are 11! It was easy for me to integrate and to make friends because I was always the funny guy. I like to talk a lot. I used to take acting classes after school. They used to give us homework, so one day I was researching comedians on YouTube and I watched a video by Jeff Dunan. I thought wow this guy is good, hes doing magic tricks!. The more I watched though, the more I understood it was not magic, but actually, ventriloquism. It figured it was a skill I could learn, so I taught myself by watching YouTube videos. Then I started doing my own thing by combining ventriloquism with comedy. At first, people just laughed because its funny to see a puppet talking, but when I started writing comedy scripts, people laughed at that too. Now I do stand-up comedy and ventriloquism shows. Right now, my full-time job is comedy – its what pays the bills! I perform in different places, all over South Africa - private functions and comedy clubs. What boosted my profile was my participation in SAs Got Talent 2016 – I made it to the semi-finals, so after that people started recognising me and hiring me for comedy gigs. I have never been treated differently for being a foreigner. Ive learnt to adapt and to fit in. I have learnt by observing and talking at the right time. I can now speak four South African languages, which makes it easier to connect with people from different backgrounds. Kids learn languages fast! People laugh at something they can relate to, so I make jokes that people from different backgrounds can laugh at. I use the languages Ive learnt to make the audience laugh – I make fun of the way they pronounce things in different languages, such as Tswana, Xhosa or Zulu. My puppet is a monkey called Jackie. Her name was inspired by the debate sparked by Penny Sparrows racist tweet (derogatory comments comparing black people to monkeys, which went viral in 2015 and sparked a huge debate about racism in South Africa). Jackie is a monkey and claims not to be black, so she makes people laugh! I want to reach millions with my comedy and I want Chik Aljoy to become a global household name. I want to make millions of people laugh!
399	Christian	Congo	Romania	A	E	far	1830	12929	H	im	male	"I left Congo in 2008 fleeing from the war that took away my mother and two of my brothers. I arrived in Romania together with another 34 people from my country and I started working as a taxi driver in Bucharest. Although I liked the city very much it was hard for me at first as I didnt know the language except for few words that I learned along the way. I started with simple words like hello, straight forward, left and right. In my first few days as a taxi driver I didnt even know the locations so when my passenger said stop here I did so. It took me a month to learn the main locations around Bucharest, I learned the addresses of every hotel and the route from the airport by walking around the city. I liked what I was doing, and I enjoyed my life in Bucharest, but it didnt last long as the Romanian company that I signed with in Congo changed the terms of the contract when we arrived here and when we decided to file a complaint to the authorities they just fired us. Even if we wanted to go back to Congo we couldnt as the war was still ongoing, so we were sent to Galati. I asked for political asylum in 2009 but it took nine years to receive one. In 2010 Ive got my working permit and I found a job in Craiova. I like living in Craiova, I feel like home here, there is peace and quiet and people are nice with you, but sometimes I do think of my country, I cannot stop thinking that people back home are killed every single day, this really makes me sad. I like working and I like living here, people are nice, and the culture is great, I made a lot of friends and I would like to give something back to my community. I dont think there is much I can do for my home country, at least not while there is still an open conflict; the situation is tragic, and I would like to see a change although I am not very optimistic at the moment. Romania is my home now and I am sure that anyone, no matter where they come from, could find a place of their own in this country."
400	Christian	France	United Kingdom	E	E	close	38959	40718	E	im	male	When a young 20-year-old living in his hometown of Dijon in Burgundy, France, decided to travel the world, he never realized that his first stage, Scotland, would be his final destination. I came to Scotland to open an office in Glasgow for a European seafood logistic group in the 80s. I met my wife and moved 20 years ago from Glasgow to the North East of Scotland in Aberdeenshire with our 3 young daughters. I'm proud to call Scotland my home, it's a wonderfully welcoming country with such a huge potential. I exported Scottish seafood for many years, promoting the best that we have at home and abroad. With my experience in the fishing industry, I became involved in my community and in local politics, then I joined the Scottish National Party, where, again, I was warmly welcomed. As someone who was not born here, it is sometimes easier to see the huge opportunities that we have here at our doorstep. In 1997, I voted for the Scottish Parliament to be, or more accurately to be reconvened after a 300 years interruption. I voted in every Scottish, local and European elections thereafter. At the last Scottish elections, I decided to demonstrate how modern and inclusive democracy Scotland really is. I put my name forward to become a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the North East of Scotland. As a Frenchman living in Scotland, to be elected to sit in the Scottish Parliament was very humbling. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the people of the North East of Scotland as a regional MSP since 2013. We are living in the 21st century, our world has changed for the better, people are now traveling and setting up across the globe like never before. Our history shows that generations of Scottish people have migrated away from Scotland, this is why it is easier for us to now welcome those who are choosing to live here. It is time to open up our home, our nation, our democracy and allow everyone who lives here to contribute to society. Let's remember the words of the late Bashir Ahmed, the Scottish Parliament's first Muslim MSP who migrated from Pakistan: 'It's not where we came from that's important, it's where we're going together.'
401	Christian	Germany	United Kingdom	E	E	close	45909	40718	E	im	male	I am born in Germany. I first came to England in 1991 as a student, because I didn't like my German university, English was my only foreign language and the course looked good. After getting a BSc (Hons) and a MSc in Transport Planning and Management, I looked for jobs in Germany and Britain, and in 1997 the first offer was as Transport Planning Assistant from the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive. In Manchester I got promoted a couple of times, found a (British) girl-friend, got a job offer from Strathclyde Passenger Transport (2002), got kids, got made supernumerary in a reorganisation, and got a job offer as Transport Planning Manager in South Wales (2007) where my family and I still live. I work in an office, I shift paper. I write (transport) strategies, plans and programmes (and reports and studies and consultation responses and I develop and manage schemes. I cannot think of anything that screams out for a strap-line of how I contributed to society. I did get involved in many transport projects, I improved the design of bus stations and bus lanes and I helped to ensure that Scotland's smoking ban extends to bus shelters (imagine if it wouldn't.). But mostly I wrote plans, gathered necessary information, and set up systems and developed processes to enable delivery of many other projects.
402	Christian	Italy	Belarus	E	E	close	31238	6377	E	im	male	Christian is Italian. He was born in a small village located not far from Milan, and lived there until he turned 25. Then he first moved for a couple of months to Scotland where he worked. Afterwards he lived in France, Belgium, Switzerland, and, finally, in Belarus where one of his client offered him to work as the director of his fruits and vegetables production company. Christian has been living in Belarus for five years now. He even got married here and decided to start his own business. Theres always something better in the world. Thats why I quickly accepted the job offer in Belarus. It is a really good country to run a business despite some existing difficulties. I see plenty opportunities here. Look at Belarus geographical location, for example. Being located between Europe and Russia it should be one of the richest countries in Europe! Its no problem for me to move to a new country. Every minute of my life in a new surrounding is exciting. At first when I came here I only knew two words in Russian. But if I get an opportunity to go to Canada for instance, I would move there without doubt and hesitation. When I turn 80, I want to be able to tell myself that Ive spent every hour of my life doing something exciting. I consider myself to be a citizen of the world at 100%. Home to me is where I live at the moment. I like it here, its comfortable. But this the country where I feel like a foreigner most of the time, if I compare with other countries where I used to live. People sometimes look at me as if I were an alien, I dont even know why. I cannot say that the way I dress or look differs from Belarusians much. Probably, thats because Kobrin is a small city. I can tell you for sure that Belarus has really taught me a lot. One of the things Ive learnt here is the importance of family values. Much more important than in Italy.
403	Christina	Haiti	Canada	L	N	far	1360	43560	H	im	female	"Migration for me is this desire to expand ones mind… its a way of going beyond the comfort zone we were born and raised in to find ourselves. Migrating to Canada at a very young age to study was a defining moment for Christina. I left for Montreal when I was 17. Thats when I came across art or, perhaps, I should I say I came across myself! she explains with a laugh. At first, it wasnt easy. I went there alone, strictly to study, but I quickly changed it into something so beautiful and enriching! I met so many people from different places in the world and it was such a great way for me to find out who I was. For Haitian painter and yoga teacher Christina Clodomir, known by her art name Makeda, migration and travel are essential to her artistic expression, and are likely the very reason why she became an artist. Her internationally-exhibited paintings, as well as her eclectic interests in visual arts, yoga and meditation, have brought her all around the globe, including India, Thailand, Dubai and Europe. Taking inspiration from the colors and nature of her native country, she challenges the boundaries of traditional Haitian art to bring across a universal message: reminding humanity that, even in the face of disaster, there is still beauty. The goal for Christina was never to live permanently in Montreal. I am really Caribbean in my blood! she jokes. After her son was born, the urge to come home to her husband and family became even stronger. When my son was a baby, I had a hard time pushing him in the stroller in the snow. I found it was very hard to raise a child by myself. In Haiti we are not raised like that – here its really a family thing. Determined to take her art to the next level, Christina came back to Haiti in 2007. But her passion for travelling and discovering other cultures has remained unchanged. I have travelled extensively for my art exhibits. I just came back from India two months ago, where I became a certified yoga teacher. Christina was in Haiti when, in January 2010, her country was hit by one of the most devastating natural disasters ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. In the earthquake, I saw so many people so close to me pass away in just a few seconds… people who had big dreams, says Christina, painful memories clouding her otherwise cheerful eyes. I just realized at that moment that I had no time to waste! Art became a way for Christina to elaborate the traumatic experience of the quake. Painting was a form of meditation for me, a way to distance myself from the destruction that was all around us. I had an important message to send: I had to remind humanity that, even in the face of disaster, there is still beauty. This part of us never dies. The art series that Makeda is best known for is a collection of brightly colored tropical flowers reminiscent of Georgia OKeeffes paintings. The flower series is a result of my attempts to meditate in a garden up in the Kenscoff Mountains after the earthquake. I just started looking at plants on a different level, looking at them much closer, feeling the energy of the plants, and transferring it onto my canvas. When asked what her art can communicate to people abroad, Christina has clear ideas: I think they definitely see the Caribbean! They see those bright colors, and perhaps they might feel inspired to come here and feel the energy, the vibrancy, the joy of the Caribbean. I could have been the kind of Haitian artist who paints traditional subjects easily identifiable as Haitian, like a peasant with some fruit on their head. But this is not what my art is about. I want my art to speak to everyone; I want to make my art universal. I think the reason why my paintings have so quickly travelled the world is because they have the potential to touch every soul."
404	Christine Lina	United States	Japan	N	I	far	63123	39990	E	im	female	I was born and raised in the United States where my parents, who are Japanese, met. They have been living in the States longer than they have in Japan and had never planned to return. My parents enrolled me in a Japanese school in America. It was once a week on Saturdays and at the time, I hated attending. Most other students were children from Japan who would eventually return after a couple of years, for their parents work. Due to cultural and pedagogical differences, I did not fit-in with the majority and struggled to see the benefits of attending. Today, I am thankful for my parents decision. The Japanese language skills I have now would have been difficult to attain had I not attended the Japanese school. By high school, I began studying Japanese on my own, my biggest motivation being that I did not want to lose the only form of communication I had with my grandparents and relatives. I would say that I am fluent in Japanese now, but there are still many technical terms and cultural mannerisms that I have yet to learn and adapt to. My physical appearance is that of a regular Japanese person, so expectations do not always match up to my behavior and at times, explaining misunderstandings can be a strain. However, this is only more incentive for me to stay active and spread knowledge on the unique characteristics and erring presumptions surrounding the Nikkei, or namely Japanese-Americans. In the summer of 2011, I was on my way to Japan for the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme. Before taking part in the program, I had both American and Japanese citizenship, but upon employment I was required to renounce my Japanese citizenship. It was not an easy decision, to say the least. For a long time, I was unsure of and pondered my identity: Am I Japanese or American? I was only sure that I love Japan and wanted to live there at some point, at least for a short while. Probably because I feel that Japan is, alongside the US, one of my home countries and my roots lie there also. I urge more Japanese people to experience life overseas and explore beyond the vacation itinerary boundaries. The people in this country provide, in my opinion, the best hospitality for visitors and that is something I pride my Japanese self in. On the other hand, I sense that there is still a great amount of stereotypes and misconceptions present in this country in terms of foreign countries and the people who live there. My hope is that by exposing oneself to a variety of cultures and worlds, the 'scary' image of living in other countries disappears and each individuals world expands and becomes fuller in return.
405	Christophe	France	China	E	I	far	38959	10229	E	im	male	"Christophe, professionally known as Dantès – or  Dai Liang » which means the light bearer and the one whos from Lyon in Chinese, is a French singer and song-writer whos been living in Shanghai for 12 years. Hes the symbol of a successful alliance between two opposite cultures. He managed to seduce the Chinese audience by bringing his French style while abiding by the artistic codes of his host country. When I settled down in China in 2000, I was one of the rare French expats who could speak Chinese fluently; which enabled me to stand out. In 2005, after learning a lot about the Chinese TV and show business, I took part in a TV show about foreigners and the Chinese culture which made me popular. Then I recorded an album. I was the first Westerner to compose songs written in Chinese. They deal with European themes and are popular among the Chinese youth, who see France as a romantic and culturally rich country. I bring my own touch by speaking about the culture of my country of origin. As Europe is showing interest in opening up to the Asian world and in particular China, Dantèss artistic activity is developing more and more in France. As I know the Chinese peoples way of living and habits very well, some town hall workers call me in to promote the Chinese culture in their city. I act as a link for those two nations both in France and China. My force and popularity lie in the fact that I remained myself, authentic, while adapting to the country codes. To live abroad taught me that its important to fight for your dreams but also to be satisfied with what you have, even if its not much. Although the Chinese and French cultures are very different, I quickly adapted to my host country and its lifestyle. I call both China and France home. I love the way people work in China. The scope of possibilities is wide and everything moves and evolves fast here. I also enjoy the combination of tradition and modernity here. When my leg got broken a few years ago, I benefitted from cutting-edge cares that mix Western and Chinese medicines. The surgery happened quickly and went well although I never really felt pampered. Theres no time nor enough space for that. Its in the nature of the countrys culture and lifestyle. That is what I miss from France: the way people bond and socialize. But I found my perfect balance. Over the last year, Ive been going back to France regularly to give concerts; which enables me to make the most of everything I love in both countries."
406	Ian	United Kingdom	Switzerland	E	E	close	40718	86919	E	im	male	Im a scientist, and I came to Geneva from Glasgow to work at CERN in 1969, so I could do my experiments. I did not want to leave Scotland, but the science was better over here. The most difficult part about moving to a new place is my accent, which is now much better than it was. I always had to repeat myself three times - Id ask for hot chocolate and get an omelette! But slowly it improved as I met more people and, as our language improved, we finally integrated exrtremely well. I decided to stay in Geneva, because it was a wonderful time to stay in CERN and Geneva is a great place too. I learned to ski in Scotland, so coming here was like coming to Paradise. But we still keep our traditions. I have three sons and all of them play Scottish national instruments: two play the bag pipes, and the third plays the violin. We came here as economic migrants, but also as cultural migrants.
407	Ian	United States	Estonia	N	E	far	63123	23106	E	im	male	My connection to Estonia extends through my Fathers side of my family. His parents emigrated from Estonia, like so many others, after the Second World War, seeking refuge from the war-torn and Soviet occupied nation. My first experience with Estonia was in 5th grade, when we were asked to give a presentation on the country our family was from. I remember feeling a certain pride in being the only one to represent Estonia, a country my peers had never heard of. A couple of years later I got a chance to experience Estonia when my father took my brother and me to visit his brother in Tallinn. The experience of travelling such a long distance to such an unfamiliar place was profound, creating lasting memories and certainly influencing my future decision to move here. I returned to Estonia several times as an adult to visit my brother who had moved to Tallinn, eager to experience Europe and a culture outside of the United States. During these trips I developed an even closer connection with the country, people and lifestyle. Over the course of these short trips, Estonia began to feel like a place I could call home. In 2008 I decided to join my brother in Tallinn permanently—or at least as permanently as I could handle emotionally at that time. Because our Fathers parents were both Estonian citizens by birth, my siblings and I were also eligible for citizenship. The first year proved to be an emotional challenge. In Pittsburgh I had a home—family, friends and the comfort of familiarity and habit. Flying to Tallinn with a one-way ticket was something I had never done before. Here was a new challenge without a foreseeable end. The first year became more about survival than anything else—finding a job that would pay bills, not necessarily evolve into a career. After ten months, I was on the brink of returning to the US. Time and trust changed everything. Things started falling into place. I have now been in Tallinn for nearly eight years, Im working a dream-job teaching at the Tallinn European School and pursuing a Masters Degree at Tallinn University in teaching English as a foreign language. I am more fulfilled artistically than I ever felt in the United States and have so many amazing opportunities in Tallinn that I could never have imagined when I first boarded that plane. I feel incredibly blessed to have the opportunities I have in Tallinn, Estonia, and Europe. I know that I am privileged to have been eligible for Estonian citizenship and to be welcomed in the country as someone who belongs. There are many others who, sadly, do not receive the same warm welcome for various reasons. But I hope that, as a migrant to this country, I can be an example to others as someone who has created a life here—who feels, wholeheartedly, that Estonia is a country worth calling home.
408	Ibrahim	Cameroon	Niger	A	A	close	1502	568	E	im	male	"A few years ago, there was a Boko Haram attack at a market where my parents were doing their grocery shopping. They both died that day; I was 12 at the time. I wasn't even allowed to see their bodies or attend the funeral. The Cameroonian army took me to Yaoundé where an adoptive family me took me in. It was tough growing up without my biological parents or my little sister, who I havent seen since that day. Later on, my foster father died as well so I was left with my foster brothers and foster mother. We didnt have any money for my education. After I had saved enough, I bought a motorcycle and started working as a driver, but I couldnt live off of that. My foster mother could barely feed her own children so I couldnt expect her to be able to feed me as well. I decided to go to Algeria with my 14-year-old foster brother. On our way, as we passed through Nigeria, bandits took away everything we had: my backpack, my clothes, my phone – everything. We were in Algeria for one month. We couldnt survive there anymore as I didnt have any money left. To get back, we walked through the desert for one week straight. It was really hard as I needed to take care of the little one as well. There were 27 of us in the desert, but two died there and others got sick. You go to sleep at night as a group and then in the morning some are missing. We tried hiding from the sun but there is no place to hide in the desert. We had no food, just a bit of water. The older ones helped us with water from time to time. We had our first meal when we arrived at IOMs transit centre in Arlit. I dont know what I will do when I go back. At least my foster brother has his parents, but I dont have anyone. I know how dangerous it is and I now know its not worth the risk, but going to Europe was my biggest dream and I failed at it."

But they did not consider me as a refugee and rejected my application for asylum trying to deport me back to my home country. After that I made my way to Germany, because I knew it is a safe country. People that are coming like this, take their lives in their own hands and just go. I had a very bad journey from Bulgaria to Germany. When I left Bulgaria and arrived in Serbia, some smugglers, like Mafia groups caught me. They stole my money, my phone, everything that I had left. But I continued my way going to Hungary, then Austria and finally Germany. When I entered Germany, everything was fine. The police behaviour was good, the people very nice. I think Germany is a good country with decent people. Here in Germany I am starting a new life. Im trying to build a life in a safe country and try to communicate with people. I want to know more about the culture and living in this country. My next step is to learn the German language. Im reading and listening to music a lot, because I need it. I need the language for my life, for my work. And after that Ill try to have my own work, to continue my occupation. My family, I miss them most. We had two new-born nephews and I couldnt see them, but sometimes I see them on the internet. I love my country, but there is a problem with politics, with religions. So for me there is no possibility any more, to live in our country, in my home country. Ibrahim hopes that Germany will be his new home.
410	Ibrahim	Sudan	United States	A	N	far	1415	63123	H	im	male	"Ibrahim is a member of the Fur tribe—the Darfur region of Sudan bears its name. He lived there for the first twelve years of his life, until 2003, when his village was attacked by the Janjaweed. Twenty cars and fifty men on horseback arrived in Ibrahims village at 4am one fateful morning, staging an attack that would devastate the village and leave his grandfather and sister dead. They set the region on fire, and we fled to the mountains. We stayed there for three weeks. When he returned to his village, it was empty. The residents had either been killed or had left; all of those who survived went to Kassab, a camp for IDPs. He stayed there for two days, but even the camps were not safe. The Janjaweed started kidnapping able bodied men, so Ibrahim returned to the mountains, visiting the camp under the cover of night to see his family. He eventually decided to move to Khartoum, where he worked in order to earn enough money to apply for his passport. While waiting, he met his wife who was working in a restaurant close to where he was staying. They married and now have two girls. Even in Khartoum, Ibrahim and his family were not safe. Still persecuted for his ethnicity, the familys home was attacked. Ibrahim was taken to the police station where he was beaten with sticks, electrocuted, and had his fingertips crushed with pinchers. The accusation? Opposing the government. Grounds for accusation? Belonging to the Fur tribe. Ibrahim was held in detention for a month, and was released on the condition of not leaving Khartoum or returning to Darfur. He had to check in to the police station every two days. New passport in hand, Ibrahim and his family fled to Cairo where they applied for refugee status with UNHCR on January 1st, 2013. To make matters worse, his family had a hard time integrating into Egyptian life, finding the language differences to be a significant barrier and encountering racism and accusations of taking resources away from Egyptians. Despite the difficult living conditions in Egypt, returning to Sudan was not an option as Ibrahims life would be at risk. Finally contacted to have their resettlement interview in November 2014, the process for Ibrahim and his family to go to America was recently completed, and by time of publication they will be in America. Ibrahim said he is looking forward to living in freedom and democracy, but mostly he is happy for his girls to have a better opportunity than they would have had in Egypt or Sudan. In Sudan, even if my daughter was the top of her class at school, another child would get preference simply because my child is Fur. He is eager to start English lessons and learn some new skills to support his family. He eventually wants to reunify his family who are currently scattered around Sudan. Sudan is my home country. I would love to go back, but only if the regime changes."
411	Ibtissam	Belgium	France	E	E	close	45028	38959	E	im	female	My father went to Europe in the 1960s. My parents barely spoke about it with us children. It was just a normal thing to do at the time: There was no work in Morocco, so the men went to Europe. I myself was born in Brussels, but for 16 years I was a Moroccan. Then my parents changed their citizenship and so did I. When I was 27, I went to Germany for five years and then, three years ago moved on to France. However, these moves within Europe, I hardly consider as migration. I still feel a little bit Moroccan, but not as much as I used to. My parents consider themselves half-Belgian, but I think Im just Belgian. Its interesting though, always this question of where do you come from. Here in France, people often think Im from Algeria or Tunisia, since I look that way. When I tell them, Im Belgian, they always ask again. This Yes, but where do you REALLY come from? – Its unpleasant. I grew up in an immigrant neighbourhood in Brussels. I realised early, that we were all immigrants, but also that there were still differences between us. I went to a catholic school and felt rejected by the teachers. There were three groups: the white Belgian children, the catholic children from other European countries and us. There was open racism directed at us, quite frequently. I only learned later in life that other people didnt consider me white. To me, when I was younger, I considered myself white. I thought there is white people and black people, and Im certainly not black, hence I had to be white. But thats not how other people saw me. So, it seems Im a person of color. It took me a long time, but when I accepted it, knowing two different cultures very well turned out as an advantage for me. I feel like Im more open to things. I can easily accept other countries and since Im bilingual, it was quite easy for me to learn other languages. I fail to grasp what people mean when they speak about integration. I think in fact they mean that we should be as similar as possible to the people whose families have been here for longer. But even if one tries, speaks the same language, eats the same food, and generally, does everything like them – one will never be good enough, and at the end still look different. Migration cannot mean to move to another country to just become exactly like the people who are already there. I am annoyed when people are giving migrants the feeling that their rights are privileges which they actually should not enjoy. First of all, all people should really have the same rights and be treated without prejudices. One does not have to eat pork and drink wine to be Belgian or French.
412	Ifrah	Somalia	Somalia	A	A	close	118	118	E	hc	female	I have been in Somaliland for two years now. I went as a refugee to Finland and was trained as a nurse there. The drought situation here is bad. The drought can be seen everywhere in western Somaliland.  In one day we treated more than 500 people in the village of Ikaweyne. Many of them had bloody diarrhoea. Others were anaemic or malnourished, especially the children. I am working for the Drought Outreach Response of the MIDA FINNSOM Health-project: it brings diaspora experts to their country of origin. Local health care professionals and us from the diaspora can work together. Twice a week we go to the villages where people fleeing the drought have gathered. Many of the patients also had respiratory infections, coughs, fevers and eye infections. The sand is blowing all the time there. If you stand still for ten minutes, you will be covered. That day in Ikaweyne we had local nursing students with us. There were almost a hundred of us, but still we felt that we couldnt do enough. The medicines ran out before we were done. There was so much to do, but we couldnt help them all. Some of the people are so weak that they cant walk to the nearest hospital 10 kilometre away, even if they need urgent care. There is always an ambulance with us when we go, and we always need it. From Ikaweyne we sent four people to the hospital with the ambulance. One had meningitis, one was a pregnant woman and two were children. In the hospital there is not enough of anything, not of staff nor of medicines, but the worst is that there is a shortage of electricity. How can you do a surgery if there is no light? There are no trees and no grass, only sand. The cattle are getting thinner and are desperately trying to find something to eat. There are dead animals along the side of the road. One day, I saw a cow eating another animal – that is something I have never seen before.
413	Ileana	Nicaragua	Costa Rica	L	L	close	1905	12077	H	im	female	When Ileana left for Costa Rica at age 30 to work as a domestic worker, she never imagined that after 20 years she would return to Nicaragua as the first Coordinator of the Association of Domestic Workers. Before I went to Costa Rica, I worked as a secretary and an experienced teacher in Nicaragua. After being married for a long time, I had problems with my partner and decided to divorce. Then I started my journey to Costa Rica in search of better opportunities for me and my children.  Ileana left without a work permit to Costa Rica, so she could not continue working in her previous careers. I managed to find work, but only domestic work. I had to leave my professional life behind. I had many qualifications, and had studied for over two years to become a teacher. During those 20 years, Ileana had the opportunity to work in many Costa Rican households. I spent almost seven years doing very hard work, for low pay and had no health insurance. Ileana recalls an accident where her kneecap was broken into three pieces while cleaning a house. At that time I was illegal because I had no residency card and my passport was expired, but I got my papers thanks to a friend, who told me we could get them through an amnesty process between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, around 1990. After the accident, she couldnt work for a year until she found her last job, where she worked for 13 years and, thanks to her former boss, could meet the Association of Domestic Workers in Costa Rica, of which she is now Coordinator in Nicaragua. Migration brings pain, but it also brings compensation. I felt proud, because I was working, supporting my children, preparing for a better life in my country.  After two and a half years back in Nicaragua, Ileana feels extremely grateful for the opportunities she received in Costa Rica. It was all a new experience, but I never gave up. As part of her work of the Association of Domestic Workers, Ileana gives trainings on gender issues, employment law, immigration law, as well as workshops on the basics of management and how to manage accounts for women who are the heads of their household. I prepare women here by telling them that migration is a right, and if no one violates these rights, we will find better opportunities to do whatever you want because you will have more opportunities for work. That is meaningful to me, to help those in need, and that's why I love my job. For now Ileana continues as a coordinator of the Association of Domestic Workers in Nicaragua, and also as a labor attorney, now that I got my degree, she says proudly. But she does not plan to stop there, and due to a lack of resources she had not been able to finish her studies, but next year I will have a scholarship to finish studying, so I will be able to protect women even more. Thanks to migration I am where I am and I have my work. Moreover, after all my hard work, I have a very nice house which my children and grandchildren can enjoy.

Weve spent one year and two months here. It wasnt easy: at first, we were living in camps, in a tent and then we had to share an apartment with many other families, there was always a lot of fuss and no privacy whatsoever. Additionally, my teenage girl has been out of school for two years now, except for the last one month when she attended school in Axioupolis. Before the war, my husband, Nehad, was working at the ministry, in the sector of urban planning while I was teaching French at a public school in the city of Deir Ez-Zor. We left our life in Syria as our beautiful city was ravaged by the war. My daughter, Leen, had to quit school as it was destroyed. In the meantime, our son, Mustafa, was born. He was only 4 months old when we fled. We had to cross dangerous territory on foot. We walked on the mountains, it was terrifying. One day, the police put a gun on my babys head, they threatened us. We spent two days at the police department. It took us two attempts to successfully cross the Turkish border and in a few days, we managed to arrive to the island of Chios. Because of the war, our family got scattered. My parents live in Saudi Arabia, I have one sister in Damascus and a brother back home, in Deir Ez-Zor. My other three sisters are in Germany, the last of them arrived there only last week. I have a lot of dreams for my life in Germany. First of all, I dream about living with my family in a proper house, all by ourselves! Certainly, Ill need to get a job, as Im very energetic. Leen needs to get back to school and continue with her education. And of course, I dream of a beautiful life for my boy. He needs to sleep in peace, he has never slept in a calm environment in his short life. I dream of the day that I will be able to buy new clothes for all of us, theres so much I want to do! I hope that my husband and I will be able to leave behind all the hardships and focus on our future. Since the day we left, not a day goes by without thinking of Syria. I loved my life, my city, my house, the school where I was teaching. I had my family, my friends and my students. I wouldnt mind moving to France as I speak the language but in Germany, thankfully, I will reunite with my sisters.
415	Ilija	Serbia	Rwanda	E	A	far	7656	798	L	im	male	My name is Ilija Gubić, Im an architect born and raised in Serbia. I started traveling with my family at a young age, before the war started in Yugoslavia. Once the violence broke out, I stayed at home and witnessed my country being destroyed — bombed. Since I saw cities being destroyed during my childhood, I have an urge to support reconstruction. I spent my formative years studying architecture in Serbia, and later moved to Italy, where I continued studying post-disaster reconstruction. Because Italy is close to Serbia it was not difficult for me to return home when needed, which made the transition much smoother. After my studies, I joined the United Nations to work on building back better, to increase resilience of nations and communities after disasters. My job allowed me to live in Thailand and to travel to Myanmar, Maldives, Nepal, and other countries in Asia and the Pacific for short assignments – there are several cities in these regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. At the end of 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded, hit the Philippines, leaving more than four million people homeless. I joined the UN team to support the reconstruction. In 2015, I moved to New York to work at the UN headquarters on the New Urban Agenda, a document adopted by member states of the United Nations that establishes recommendations for urban development in the next two decades. The New Urban Agenda also addresses issues of cities and migration, leaving no one behind. In 2017, I moved to Rwanda to work on sustainable urban development and green growth for the countrys secondary cities. Rwanda sees urbanization as an opportunity for national economic development. The country is urbanizing rapidly with a 4.5 percent annual growth rate among the urban population. Migration from rural to urban areas is intensified. Whenever I move to a new country, I stay on the lookout for different experiences. In the beginning, I take on the role of an observer: trying to understand the local culture, exploring what kind of relationships I can build. When I relocate I also try to keep up with my hobbies. I paint, for example, and change the colors I use based on my impressions of the place I move to. I also explore 20th century art and architecture. I am a migrant, with a far less agonizing migrant experience compared to many, and I never forget where I come from. I try to go home frequently and maintain regular contact with family and childhood friends so that I can stay connected to my roots, which helps me to keep going and exploring. For anyone planning to move from their home for education, they should have a clear idea of what they want to learn and achieve. If they want better job opportunities, then they should know what kind of city could offer them. When there is an objective, it is easier to plan strategically and reach it. During the decade-long war in Yugoslavia my family was hosting refugees: two families from Bosnia and Herzegovina. So I would urge anyone hosting migrants to offer as much support as they can, but also to take the opportunity to learn from the migrants, and create meaningful bonds with people coming from different backgrounds and different realities. Migration and architecture are linked. Today, the world is witnessing a massive migration movement. The conditions are changing and with them the requirements in terms of housing, and urban development. Architects, along with other technical experts can respond to migration issues only when everyone works together in a coordinated fashion.
416	Ilir	Albania	Albania	E	E	close	5181	5181	E	hc	male	Ilir knows how to make a good espresso. Together with his father, Ilir runs a coffee bar in the outskirts of Fier, in the southern part of Albania. The suburbs of the Albanian cities grew dramatically in the 90's due to a large internal migration from the countrys mountainous and remote areas. In most cases, suburban areas developed irregularly without proper planning or adequate services. Increasingly populated and affected by a very high unemployment rate among the youth, these areas are fertile grounds for emigration. Ilir has a younger sister, a very young mother and a strong and protective father. They live in a one-storey house, with a single room with kitchenette, which turns into Ilir and his sisters bedroom after dinner. The mother takes care of the housework, while his father used to work occasionally hardly affording the familys basic needs. When only 17 Ilir decided to look for a better future and support his family by irregularly migrating to Norway in search of a job to send money home. However, he soon realized he could not remain there and that returning home was the only option he had. The only thing that reminds him of his migration experience is the suitcase, which he departed and returned with. When I was abroad I missed my family a lot, Ilir said. But the support I received* permitted me to archive the goal I set for myself before departure and also allowed me to stay close to the family. The coffee bar doesn't have many customers, but the number is increasing every day. Ilir and his father also run a football field next to the bar. In the mornings children from the nearby school play various sports while in the afternoons and evenings amateur players often use it. When the field is empty and there are few customers at the bar, Ilir takes the ball and goes to take some shots at the goal.   *IOM helped Ilir and his family open and manage a coffee bar through the payment of the rent and the purchase of some furniture. After the initial start-up period, the revenue is now sufficient to cover the cafés operating expenses and ensure a fixed and solid income for the family.
417	Imam Zia	Afghanistan	United States	I	N	far	508	63123	H	im	male	Even though I was young, all I can remember from my early childhood is the war. During those days, there was a lot of running around for my family because the Soviets would target specific villages where they believed there was resistance or weapons that could target their convoys as they are passing by. We kept going back and forth from our village to the eastern part of Afghanistan near the border with Pakistan. We would stay there for a few months and once we felt things were calmer we would return home but as soon as violence started erupting again we would flee. When we crossed the border into Pakistan it was a whole new experience because we had never been out of Afghanistan prior to the war. Now we were in a new country. Since there is shared heritage and people in north-western Pakistan spoke Pashto, one of the two languages we speak at home (Farsi being the other), there was no language barrier for us. But it was still a different country, a different currency and most importantly for us it was a different kind of climate. A lot of the education within the refugee community was heavily religious education and there was a reason for that. Conditions were so tough that faith and religion provided a safety net for everyone that you could lean on regardless of how tough things were. Holding on to our faith made life bearable. The camps themselves were these deserted areas that refugees had to develop on their own. When you first cross the border and arrive at the camp you had to build your own house on the plot of land that was given to you. These houses would be made of either mud or other natural resources available. Many of these refugees lived there for two to three decades. People would go about their lives happily making the most out of things. After ten years, the refugees turned these deserts into an oases. You would go to these camps and see a lot of trees, plants, and flowers… I cherish my educational experience and for me, it was a very pleasant and beautiful experience of learning my faith. Now looking back people see it as something negative that played a role in extremism and violence. I went through a madrasa education, there was no militancy, and no one taught me to go kill people or hate people. Before coming to America I had learned English in Peshawar. If I had continued to live in Afghanistan I would have never been able to learn foreign languages like Arabic, Urdu, and English or get any kind of education. So this experience of being a refugee came with hardships but also with a lot of blessings. For the first year every day, I kept saying to myself that next week Im going to go back. Its a healing process because youre separated from your motherland and that takes a huge toll on you because no matter how great America is you will always miss your motherland. A few things I would like people in the host countries to know is that refugees are refugees because they are literally seeking refuge and shelter. No one is doing this because crossing borders and oceans and risking your life its an enjoyable experience… The second thing is for them to look at the example of the previous generation of refugees that have come and have settled in Europe or America. For the most part, refugees have become an asset to their community and host countries. America is what it is mostly because it has embraced people, refugees and immigrants who have made America great.
418	Iman	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	female	Iman is a regular at one of IOM-supported food kitchens in Gaziantep. Having left her home town of Aleppo with her husband Muhammad and six children early in the war, she has been going to the food kitchen for the past five years. Life here has been hard, but life back in Syria before the war was also hard, explains Iman. Originally from rural Aleppo, the couple have had a long history of struggling with unemployment while living in Gaziantep. Every day, Iman lines up alongside hundreds of other Syrians at the food kitchen to receive a hot meal and loaves of bread to feed her family of eight. The food is quite good and the children dont mind eating the same meal every lunch says Iman. But, its not enough for all of us. It doesnt leave us hungry but it doesnt leave all of us satisfied either, she adds. Thankfully the bread is enough to get us through the day. Together with her husband, she visits other food banks and kitchens to receive breakfast and dinner. As they continue to search for stable work to improve their standard of living, the food provided by the kitchen, helps alleviate one immediate worry from their minds. Looking over at the happy kids having their lunch, she smiles at least theyre enjoying it!
419	Imene	Algeria	France	A	E	far	3368	38959	H	im	female	"I used to come to France on holiday pretty regularly. It made me want to see how medicine was taught elsewhere and to discover a different dynamic in the doctor-patient relationship. I realize now that there is no fundamental difference in the way medicine is practiced in France and in Algeria. The only true difference is the means and the access to healthcare that one benefits from here. There are a lot of misperceptions about Algeria, and people think that it is a closed country. I wish that the image of my country will change: we are free there and we all practice our religion in our own different way. The Algerian and French cultures are very connected; dont forget that we used to watch the same TV shows when we were kids! In order to break the stereotypes anchored in peoples minds, we should invite you to come to our country. Come and see how Algeria really is! I am proud to show my country, there are so many beautiful things to see there!"
420	Imogen	United Kingdom	Germany	E	E	close	40718	45909	E	im	female	"I'm originally from the UK, but my current home is in Germany where I'm carrying out a research fellowship. My early impressions of Germany were that the country works efficiently and people are friendly, yet direct. I wouldn't say that my impressions have changed much since being here. I've had to make homes away from home before; when I was 15 I moved to Kuwait with my family. But it has been difficult to integrate into the society here in Germany and to get to know people well, so I have taken advantage of the opportunities available to me. I keep in mind that the home is dynamic; it is where your family is, where you have good memories and where you make your nest. Through my volunteer work with a UK organisation, I do maintain some links to my home country. My advice to people in the UK is to keep an open mind and identify with the migrants in our country, with a view to maintaining a culturally rich society."
421	Inas	Syrian Arab Republic	Lebanon	M	M	close	890	9310	H	im	female	"My name is Inas and I want to tell you about 8th January 2013 – a day that I will always remember. That was the day my husband disappeared, leaving me and my three daughters alone in the world. We led a very happy life in Syria – it was a quiet life but we were content. My husband went to work and returned each evening. On 8th January, he never came back. I tried to call him, I tried to contact his colleagues – I tried everything but no one has heard anything about him since that day. For two years, I waited at home for him until one day the fighting intensified and our house was completely destroyed. We had to run in the middle of the night. I was so scared for my little girls; the fighting felt like a wildfire that was spreading faster than our legs could run. Now we are in Lebanon, where we still fall asleep and wake to the sounds of missiles, weapons and fighting. But here it is also cold and we miss the warmth of our beds and homes. I wrap the girls in blankets to try and stop them trembling all night. Nothing keeps us warm in these makeshift tents. WFP vouchers mean we are able to buy rice, wheat flour, butter, sugar, oil and whatever else we can afford. It is not enough but I dont know what I would do without them – how would I feed my daughters? My only hope is for my children to live a luckier life than me. I want them to return to Syria and get an education. I want this not only for my daughters, but for all of the Syrian children who are out of school. I dont want them to miss out on everything in life."
422	Inas and Murat	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	n	"When the war broke out in Syria, my family and I crossed the border to go to Turkey. My husband and I were both in Turkey when we decided to get married but most of our friends and family were still in Syria.  So, we crossed back to Syria and had our wedding there. We wanted to be with those we loved the most. After the wedding, though, we came back to Turkey. Back in Syria, my husbands family owned an international business. He used to fly to China and Malaysia for work. But when I met him, he was broke.  His family lost everything because of the war.  They lost their business, and many lost their lives. Moving to Canada is the best opportunity weve had since we left Syria; we can finally stop worrying. I just want to live, work and perfect my English.  My husband wants to get a proper job, then we can finally have a baby.  In Canada, I will have legal status. I will be like a typical Canadian. My husband has a strong business head.  He will study the Canadian market to see where the best opportunity lies for us. He can finally find a decent job where he will be paid for what he is worth – without legal status, we were not able to do that these past few years. As for me. I studied English literature in Aleppo, Syria. Id love to go back to school again to get my Phd. In Canada, I will finally not be scared all the time.  I want to feel safe, both physically and financially. I smile all the time now because I am happy. I think we will both be able to pick up our lives again where the war interrupted them."
423	Ion Lazarenco Tiron	Moldova	Ireland	E	E	close	2954	86251	H	im	male	After moving to Ireland in 1997 and taking up a job as a bus driver, Ion decided to participate in the Oceans Seven marathon – a swimming challenge consisting of seven open water channel races – to raise funds to rebuild what was left of the football field in his hometown of Braviceni, Moldova. Born and raised in Braviceni, Ion and his peers were inspired by their physical education teacher and played lots of sports. Unfortunately, he started to feel like younger generations had lost this passion for sports — at least until very recently, when Ion decided to do something about it in his childhood village. I am thinking of this country, of its children and their potential, Ion explained. Nothing makes me happier than seeing them fulfill their potential. Ion came up with the idea to take part in the swimming competition after seeing Nejib Belhedi swim 1,400 km along the Tunisian coastline to support peacekeeping in Tunisia. He thought: Why not do the same in Moldova? In 2014, Ion began his Ocean Seven marathon, swimming through the Strait of Gibraltar and the English Channel. He crossed the Catalina and Molokalai Channels in 2016, before flying back to Moldova to inaugurate the football field renovated with the money he raised from the sporting challenge. In 2018, just days after turning 40, Ion completed the entire Oceans Seven challenge. He is the eighth person to have completed the challenge, the second from Ireland and the first from Moldova. If today, 1 out of 10 people who left my village would give back to the community, my village would look like Switzerland, Ion concluded.
424	Irina	Russian Federation	Bulgaria	O	E	far	10166	10058	E	im	female	"Irina has lived in many countries but discovered her permanent home in Bulgaria. Her two children are also migrants; they have traveled and resided in various countries all over the world and speak a few languages each. Currently, Irina works as a cultural mediator for the Russian diaspora in Bulgaria. My parents are from Russia and Belarus, I lived for some time in Belarus but Im Russian. I moved to Bulgaria because I fell in love with a Bulgarian man when I was a student. During the 70s many people from the Soviet Union came to Bulgaria to study at the universities here. My professional life in Bulgaria developed very well. The year after I arrived, I started working as a chemistry teacher in a Russian language high school. I was able to teach my favorite subject in my own language. Some of my students obtained PhDs and others became scientists; I am very proud that I was part of their education. During this period of my life, I was involved in a UNESCO project teaching chemistry to children in Morocco, in French. Back then there were not that many possibilities to find Arabic-speaking teachers so they recruited French-speaking professors that wanted to teach in their field of expertise. This is why I moved to Morocco for eight years. I was able to travel during summer vacations and visited many places in Europe. Thanks to Bulgaria I had the option to visit other countries. I dont feel too far away from Russia because the Russian Cultural Center in Sofia organizes many events. Like in Russia, nature in Bulgaria is very beautiful. There are so many unknown places here,it is very different from any other place I have been to."
425	Iryna	Ukraine	Bulgaria	E	E	close	3557	10058	E	im	female	"Iryna is a journalism student from Ukraine with a passion for writing, painting, modeling and photography. My dad is of Bulgarian origin. One day I decided to move here, so I could study in Sofia. In the South of Ukraine, where I come from, there are a lot of people who have Bulgarian roots. We have our own Ukrainian dialect in this part of the country, very similar to the Bulgarian language, so called ancient Bulgarian. Now I am also able to speak modern Bulgarian. Most of the things we have in Ukraine can also be found here - that is why I call both countries home. What I miss are more personal things, memories, like my old room in Melitopol and the Borscht (traditional Ukraine soup) my mom used to cook. I came here straight from Ukraine but I am not sure yet if Bulgaria will be the last country I move to. Last year I took part in an exchange programme for youth migrants in Brussels part of the European Commissions Erasmus + programme, with the participation of many different EU countries. All participants represented both their countries of origin and residence. I met a lot of interesting people from all over the world with whom I am still in touch with. We have a lot of things in common and we enjoy a great friendship. That is what I like the most about new places, meeting the people. When I moved to Sofia I was euphoric - I was finally living on my own, able to do my own thing and accomplish my goals. But when I got here I did not know the language, I did not even know where I would live; in the end everything worked out great! My passion for journalism helped in this process – it is an important part of my life. I incorporate the knowledge I have about Russia and Bulgaria in my work, my writing and my paintings, and I honestly cannot imagine doing anything else."
426	Isaac	Kenya	Germany	A	E	far	1879	45909	H	im	male	I'm from Machakos in Kenya. I came to Berlin a year ago for studies. Since then, I have been living in Berlin with my girlfriend who is from Germany and whom I met during our studies in England. As soon as I arrived at the airport in Germany, I noticed that all at once I was different from the others. I never had this experience in England. I was surprised that Germany wasn't as diverse as I had expected. When I first came to Berlin in 2011, I was especially impressed with the public transport system. Buses, underground trains and suburban trains that actually work. In Kenya, you have to start hours before an appointment because you get caught in a traffic jam or something won't work. This may sound like a cliché, but I think 'Home is where your heart is'. I have been traveling for the last 8 years and was far away from my home in Kenya. During this time, I learned that home means making a place one's own, being surrounded by the right people, being accepted and having this sense of being able to contribute something to society, of being able to realize one's dreams. In my apartment here in Berlin, I have three figures of giraffes carved in Kenya. Every time I look at them, they remind me of my origins. Thanks to their long neck, giraffes are able to look very far. This symbolizes the dreams I still want to achieve. One of them was to discover the world and see how other people perceive the world. Though my travels, I mostly noticed one thing: We all have our small, ordinary problems and we all have our dreams. In the end, we're not so different after all.
427	Isaac	Nigeria	Estonia	A	E	far	2085	23106	H	im	male	"I have a passion for politics. I want to serve my people; to learn from other societies, know what is happening elsewhere in the world and impart certain things to my home community. The best is to find harmony between different experiences. To do this I have to study, read and acquire vast knowledge In Nigeria we have a family farm, where we do fish farming and oil plantation. I studied and practiced agricultural economics and farming, so I applied for a masters program in Environmental Protection in Estonia. In early 2017 I came to study at the EuroAcademy. It was very cold here. Nigerian weather is hot, so this was a major difference. Estonia is good. It's secure, unlike Nigeria, I can walk anytime I want. In Nigeria you cant do this, even as a man, you have to be careful. People in Estonia mind their own business, they like the indoor life. Education here costs, but its interesting. You can speak your mind. There is hierarchy in Nigerian education. I spent five years in a school and never met the rector. Here, I can knock on the door and ask to speak with my rector. A language barrier is the problem most Nigerians have here. We dont understand the language. In Estonia many people speak English, but they dont always understand us and the way we pronounce things. I dont blame them, because English is not their mother tongue. Its a borrowed language. As a foreigner here, I feel, someone should tell us about the local laws. The police should organize a symposium to enlighten the students on what to do and what not to do in Estonia. In the end, whatever I go through in Estonia seems to me like life's normal hurdles. I find solace in the quote – 'uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.'"
428	Isabel	Portugal	United Kingdom	E	E	close	22413	40718	E	im	female	I came to the UK 14 years ago, with a friend initially just to stay a few weeks. Staying with a friend in London, I felt in love with the city straight away. Growing up in the city back in Portugal, I always dreamed of living in another country, one where I could speak my favourite language, which was English. When I was 9 years old I knew all lyrics of every British/American song on the radio and was making my own versions with my little recorder. When the opportunity came to come to London, I could not refuse, and my first day in the city exploring the streets of east London by myself, the Sunday markets, the people, the food, the melting pot of different cultures living in one city, and how you could learn an grow, was instant love. I decide I was going to stay and work. After 14 years, of hard work, a divorce, a degree and moving to North East, I can't imagine living anywhere but righ here. Of course I miss own country, where my roots are, but this is my home now, and I am very proud to be part of this diverse and tolerant culture. I met wordeful people along the way, some still with me, some I lost even to cancer, and every single one of them has taught me, how kind, caring and most of all determined and resilient, which are two qualities I truly respect, and for me are what British culture is about.

I have four brothers and, together with my parents, we are a very close family. I studied Hospitality and Tourism in Lima. I am also an amateur photographer, animalist, and environmentalist. I lived for a long time in the jungle of Junín, where I was a teacher in charge of alphabetizing many Ashaninkas students from the Pichis Palcazú Valley. My oldest student was 84 years old and my youngest student was 5 years old. They all learned in the same classroom. An incredible experience! Unfortunately, I had to leave them after two years because there was no budget to continue with the project. It was very sad for me, because I left several friends, but the good thing is that to this day we still communicate with each other. Then I lived in Lima, where I met my husband. We got married and had a daughter. Because of his job, we had to migrate to Chile. We lived there for a year until my husband was transferred to Toronto. While my husband works, I do small photographic works. I even was invited to participate in contests and I have achieved good positions. I love to cook Peruvian food while listening to music from Ayacucho (a city from Peru). Now I have two homes: Peru and Canada. We have been living in Toronto for 8 years, very close to Niagara Falls. Every year we travel to Peru. My parents came to visit and fell in love with these beautiful lands. They have always told me: Daughter be yourself. Bring out your best essence wherever you go. Being a migrant taught me to value my country, my people, and to be a better person. It is not easy to be far away. The distance hurts: my family, friends, the food, the Valley, the memories. You can leave Peru, but you will never stop being Peruvian.
430	Isatou Sowe	Gambia	Gambia	A	A	close	757	757	E	hc	female	My husband returned from Libya but died a few weeks later because he was sick. When he died, I sought the reintegration assistance that was intended for him. The support I am receiving is very impactful to me and to my husbands family. During the pandemic, I sold a few sheep and, with the profit I made, decided to buy a horse to support me on the farm during the rainy season. This will help us to have a good harvest this year. Before the rainy season starts, I rent the horse to community members so they can use it to transport and deliver goods. Because of this, I can now afford to feed five goats and six sheep. I recently completed an entrepreneurship course, which inspired me to expand my business. I just applied for a loan. Now that COVID-19 restrictions are eased, I can start going to the lumos (local markets) again to negotiate for goats. I need to be ready for Tobaski, buying small goats and selling them back when they are bigger a few months from now. My late husbands little brother Mamodou is helping me out in my daily activities. I am very happy he takes part in the business that was meant for his father. During the dry season, we keep three goats in the bush and another three in the compound because we are not able to feed them all yet. When I have enough resources to feed them, I will open a coffee shop/corner shop in the community as a second business. My goal is to expand the business and support the children of the community, raising awareness about the risks of irregular migration and show them that, with dedication to your work, it is possible to make ends meet. I want to encourage other women to empower themselves and start a new business activity within their communities.
431	Ismail	Senegal	Italy	A	E	far	1458	31238	H	im	male	I was rescued at sea by the Italians while trying to reach Europe and I was immediately given the chance to enroll in the third year of Italian public middle school here in Palermo. I am so grateful to Italians: other than having saved me, Italians also provided me with the opportunity to feel more integrated and accepted. Of course, living here is not always easy. Like many other migrants who are now living in Italy, I would like to tell the people who stayed in my country what the journey to Europe is really like but they wouldnt believe me. When I tell my brothers back home about the dangers in of coming to Italy, they think I just dont want them to come to Europe. Once, my sister asked me how things were going for me here and I told her that it can be extremely difficult sometimes. She replied: Well then just come back to Africa! You can help me take care of our mother. I would love to go back home one day, but now it is just not the right time. When I can finally be in Senegal again, I want to actively engage in helping the poorest people of my community. It hurts to see someone just like me who doesnt have anything to eat or any shelter, or children that cant go to school. I need to help them. I will help them.
432	Ismail	Sierra Leone	Mauritania	A	A	close	475	1702	E	im	male	The Boy Who Returned Home When the Sierra Leonean community in Mauritania first contacted IOM, the UN Migration Agency, it was to seek help to find a young boy who had escaped from the Mahadra (Koranic school) and had gone missing for days. The boy was Ismail¹, a nine-year-old from a poor neighborhood near Freetown, Sierra Leone. He had arrived in Mauritania in 2016, sent by his family to study the Koran. A very active, euphoric and smart boy, Ismail had decided to escape because he was unhappy in Mauritania. He was also not happy with his studies. He just wanted to go back to Sierra Leone, back to his family. When IOM staff first met him, he was always staring at the ground, scowling. Although only 140cm tall, Ismails gaze seemed that of a world-weary grown man. It was clear to the IOM team that he knew exactly what he wanted and that he would not give up until he got it. As he did not want to go back to the Mahadra, IOM placed him with a host family where he could spend some time with the familys children and play around in Nouakchott, the capital city of Mauritania. Eventually, IOM located his family and facilitated his return home in December 2016. In March 2017, IOM Mauritania followed up with a visit to assess how he was getting on. We were getting to his house and as we were crossing the market we saw him running towards us with a friend. He was full of joy, he jumped in the car and started laughing. I never saw him so happy before — Flavia Giordani, IOM Mauritania Child Protection Focal Point. IOM visited his house and met his mother and little sister. Ismail is now attending an English school in the morning and a Koranic school in the afternoon and IOM continues to monitor his progress. Ismail showed us all his school books. He was so proud. He wants to become a professor. Visiting him was really important, not only to see the results of our efforts to assist him but to appreciate his and his familys efforts to change their lives for the better. When we sat down to see his schoolwork, he took a letter from his bag and the title was To my best friend. He started crying … joyful tears. The letter was for my colleague Melainine, the Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) focal point — Flavia Giordani. Unaccompanied migrant children are children who have been separated from both parents or other relatives or guardians and are not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so². Those children often undergo long journeys and face challenging life experiences not commonly appropriate for a child. They are therefore, forced to mature much earlier than normal and end up developing strong decision-making capacities. For this reason, in the process of assisting them, IOM ensures that children are actively involved in decisions regarding their future, including the decision to continue their education, to work or to combine both. The Organization is committed to promoting and protecting the rights of unaccompanied migrant children, having their best interests as the top priority in all its activities. Since October 2016, IOM Mauritania, in collaboration with other missions in the region and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), assisted six unaccompanied migrant children in their journeys back home, helping them enter the formal educational system, and assisting their families in engaging in businesses that will allow them to strengthen their self-sufficiency and improve the households living conditions. 1The name has been changed to protect identity. 2Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 (CRC), Article 1 — For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.
433	Issa	Central African Republic	Chad	A	A	close	481	679	E	im	male	To be a migrant is not synonymous with someone who is waiting for the help of others. It is true, that forced migration, such as ours puts us in a precarious situation and dependent on others. However, for me, to be a migrant means to work to support my needs and contribute in any way I can to the development of the country that has hosted us, which happens to be our own country, Chad. I am a Chadian, returned from Bozoum a city in the Central African Republic (CAR). When I was in CAR, I worked in diamond mining but fled in 2014. After settling in the Kobiteye site in Chad in 2014, I started farming by renting the fields from the host villages because I had no other option and had to adapt to another life. I grow millet and sesame every year and am able to harvest enough. For example, in 2018, I had 36 bags of millet and shared about 7 bags with my brothers and neighbors who were unable to cultivate, and the rest allowed me to take care of my family. I count myself among those who work to feed others because the sale of my cereals at Goré market is another contribution to the economy of the country.
434	Ivan	Argentina	Italy	L	E	far	8476	31238	E	im	male	My family is of Italian descent. My great grandparents arrived in Argentina in the 1920s and thanks to my grand-parents, I was exposed to the Italian language and culture and have always desired to go to Italy to be in touch with my origins. So I decided to move there 5 years ago and I am very satisfied with my new life. I adapted really well in Milan, even though it is not the friendliest – or lets say, the most Italian – city in the peninsula. Very often people ask me if I feel Italian after 5 years living here and I reply that I dont feel 100% Italian, but neither do I feel fully Argentinian. I feel both Argentinian and Italian. I dont have roots in only one place. I can develop new ties with a different land anywhere. The term migrant is usually linked to war or catastrophes, but there is another type of migration too. My family is an example of it: war was over, they were safe but they decided to leave their home country anyways. I feel good being a migrant, but I know that there are many countries that are still skeptical about us. Italy is one of them, and that is why you recognize ethnic groups very distinctively among locals. For example, Peruvians are friends with other Peruvians, Colombians with Colombians, etc. Here, I have always been told that I speak like Pope Francis, Italian but with a Spanish accent! So a friend of mine took a picture of the pope and swapped his face with mine. We had a good laugh. If I am asked where is home for me, Id say it is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. If in the future I have to or want to change country, culture, and language all over again, Id definitely do it. These are not boundaries to me.
435	Iwona	Poland	Papua New Guinea	E	I	far	15764	2640	L	im	female	My family and I became refugees in 1986 when I was 8 years old. I was born in Warsaw, Poland and lived a very happy childhood there during communist times. Even as a child, I had a feeling that there was a wall and that there was something beyond that wall – something better than what was being offered to me. In 1986 we went on a vacation to Italy with no intention of ever coming back to Poland. My parents, brother and I left for Italy and went straight to the camp in Latina where we signed up as refugees. We were absolutely penniless, but we would go out every night once the sun set. We would wonder around on foot all the way to the Colosseum, Basilica or other beautiful historical sites that Rome had to offer and we could do that for free! You can imagine what it felt like to go from that Polish environment to the very rich, vibrant and loud environment of Rome. I was experiencing this completely different lifestyle while at the same time noticing the stress and uncertainties my parents faced during the one year it took for the paperwork to go through. After Italy, we moved to the USA because my uncle, who was living there, sponsored us to move. Getting to know new cultures, learning new languages, traveling, learning about other people - I know all of this had an effect on me. It became my life calling. This is my sixth year working abroad and my tenth year working with the United Nations. During one retreat, at dinner, I was sitting next to a colleague of mine, Pasquale, who happens to be Italian so I told him: Pasquale, you have to be careful speaking Italian around me because I can pretty much understand everything. I spoke Italian before I spoke English!. He realized that in 1986 he was very much involved in the Latina camp and said: You were one of those little Polish girls!, and I said It was me! We both got goosebumps. In our line of work, the UN provides support to the governments in order for them to provide better services for people. I send a lot of emails, write a lot of briefs, have a lot of meetings with the government and so on, but I never really know whose life that has affected. Maybe Pasquale was the one that put the finger on my familys name. Maybe he was the one that patted my head when I was a little girl running through the camp. I dont know for sure, but its very possible. That night we had a full circle moment about what impact actually means in our line of work.
436	Izak	Chile	Estonia	L	E	far	13232	23106	E	im	male	"When I graduated from university, I decided to take a break to dedicate myself to my art. Then, I decided to move to Estonia. To be honest, I had never heard about the country before I met my wife, an Estonian woman. I fell in love with her and decided to make the move; I work here as an artist, despite having a background in architecture. The first thing I noticed about Estonia was that its a very safe, clean and quiet country. In the beginning, it was quite hard for me here as I felt the people were very closed. It took me a long time to make connections and be accepted by the local people. However, now that I have managed to fit in, everything is much better. I see migration as an opportunity to reach new goals and develop as a person, because when you live in another country, you learn about other societies and cultures and you free yourself from prejudices. You can also learn new languages and improve your economic situation. However, it can also be risky, as you can encounter problems with racists or get into trouble by not knowing the culture and thus insulting someone unintentionally. It can also be tricky to find a job and deal with the bureaucratic issues. In Estonia, its very important to know the local language to properly integrate the society. Its crucial to have an active social life to improve your language skills. However, I was in Brazil before I came here and it was very different: it felt like home on the first day because of how the people treated me. Knowing the local language isnt an issue until people make it one. In the future, I hope to continue developing my art here in Estonia, Europe, and all over the world. I wish people could understand that borders are just drawn on maps – in real life, there are no lines that divide countries."
437	Jackson	Uganda	Germany	A	E	far	846	45909	H	im	male	I have a degree in social work and training in providing psychological counselling to survivors of torture. After seven years working as a counsellor supporting the rehabilitation of survivors of war in Lira, Uganda, I decided to come to Germany and study Human Rights. At that time, I already had a German girlfriend, who is now my wife. I met Nina in Uganda where we worked together on a project, providing trainings to youth on Human Rights issues. When we were in Uganda together, my brother Victor, decided to follow a local tradition and give a gift to Nina. So he presented her with a live chicken. Nina is vegetarian and in her own words she describes the experience: In that moment my German rationality came through and I thought I cant take this chicken home, they will not allow me! Im a vegetarian. I am not going to eat it. How do I tell them that I cannot accept it? Give a chicken to someone is a sign of respect. Quickly, I whispered to Nina that she could give the chicken to my brothers Son and ask him to take care of it for her. When my wife came back three months later, and asked for her chicken, they exchanged funny looks and Nina realized she would never see it again. Her chicken had already been eaten. Nina and I now live in Berlin. Learning German is one of my biggest hurdles. Another thing that is different here in Germany is making appointments to see my friends. In Uganda I normally just show up at my friends house to say 'hello' without having to book their time together.
438	Jacob	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	male	My brother and I came to Turkey, back in June 2015.  We had to leave.  If we didnt go, I would have had to fight in the military. That would have been even more difficult for me because I am a Christian.  In Syria, Daesh attacks Christians.  It was very, very hard to be a Christian in Syria.  I lived in a Christian area and bombs were dropped all the time near us.  In my small town, over 30 Christians were bombed before we left.  Who can live like that?  So we came to Turkey. My people are Syriac – part of ancient Christianity. In Turkey, we stayed in the Syriac church in Istanbul. I want to thank them as it was like a big home for us here in Turkey.  They helped us so much and I could not have lived without their help.  I did try to find work, but it is hard being both a Syrian and a Christian. No one would hire me.  In Syria, I studied to be an electrical engineer.  When the war started, I had to stop my studies.  I have some certificates, but I need to finish my degree.  My aunt already lives in Canada, and her church is sponsoring my brother and I to go there. I am so happy to fly to Canada today.  I have family there and I will study again, finally. Over a hundred years ago, my people had to flee Turkey to Syria for safety. Now, 100 years later, my brother and I are immigrating to Canada for safety. Jacob was one of the 284 Syrians on first flight departing Turkey for Canada in 2016.
439	Jacob Ndow	Gambia	Libya	A	A	close	757	4243	H	im	male	"My reason for migrating was to find greener pastures. I was unemployed in The Gambia and the prospects were very small at the time, so I thought of going to Europe to find better job opportunities there. I left in February 2014 to Libya. While in Tripoli, I was painting, earning enough money to provide for my living expenses and to accumulate some money to go further to Europe. However, this dream could not be realized, so I returned to The Gambia in March 2017. My family members were unhappy that I returned. On the other hand, they were happy that I came back alive and healthy, bearing in mind that a lot of people die on this perilous journey. I was stigmatized by society, because when you return from these journeys, society looks at you as a failure. We struggled to prove that perception wrong. I joined groups like the Migrants as Messengers (MaM) programme. Being with fellow returnees makes me feel comfortable. I used my reintegration assistance to start a cement shop in my neighborhood. The business went well and helped me in starting life afresh. Through this, I am able to use music to raise awareness and change peoples perceptions of migration. I have always been a musician. I started singing and performing in some shows even before I went abroad. When I returned, I took the career seriously due to the inspirations I had. My first song is called Travel Go to Backway. The song is about the tough experiences my fellow migrants and I faced along the backway. The song was a hit and radio stations played it. My fans appreciate it the most and people react to it a lot in shows. Even my fellow MaM volunteers always request that I perform the song for them anytime we have events together. They love the song because they can relate to the things I am saying in the song. I also did two songs on COVID-19, Get Your Mask and No To Stigma. One is about promoting safety measures; the other one seeks to combat stigma. The videos of both songs are out, and I feel very happy about that. I received good feedback from friends who said the songs are educative. Thats our mission. The coronavirus is a global problem, we all need come together and fight it. As a musician, this is my own way of contributing to the fight against the pandemic."
440	Jacques	Cameroon	France	A	E	far	1502	38959	H	im	male	"I migrated from Cameroon to France to pursue my higher education. My arrival in France was not easy. I do not come from a rich family therefore I had to live with my cousin for the first two years. Whilst living with my cousin, I balanced my schooling with a babysitting job in order to fund my school and basic needs What really stood out to me about French culture when I arrived was the level of organization; In Cameroon I had never see people eat and work on strict schedules!  Having said that, my biggest shock was not a cultural one, but instead the confusion of my internal clock. In Cameroon, the sun rises at 6 AM and sets at 6 PM no matter the time of year; this was not the case living in Brest. I used to wake and sleep with the sun thus never had to use an alarm clock. The night before my first day of class in France I went to sleep expecting to wake at 5 AM and head to school. To my surprise, I ended up sleeping until 11 AM and was late for my first day! I was in France for a few years already when I heard of a programme – the Temporary Return of Qualified Nationals - that provided opportunities for skilled Cameroonians to temporarily return to their home country and share the skills and knowledge they had developed abroad. I really wanted to participate because I consider myself lucky to have been able to migrate to France. When the possibility to return and share my knowledge arose I thought it was a great opportunity to help those who may not have been as fortunate as me. I went back to Cameroon and gave a series of lectures using techniques that were foreign to most of the participants but it was very well received. After leaving your home country to live abroad, your vision changes; you expect the same warm feeling you had when you lived there but the fact of the matter is its gone. Something inside you changes. Youre no longer Cameroonian nor are you French. Home is nowhere and everywhere at the same time."

I worked as a carpenter; life was good. But when the conflict started, I was forced to stop working and everything changed. Here at the camp, I am doing some carpentry work but it is difficult without any of my tools. A hammer is all I brought with me from Syria – it was a reminder of my country and who I was there. I wish I had also been able to bring some photos of my family too. If I could have one wish, it would be to live among my friends again. We had so many good times but the conflict has killed half of them. I want to call on the international community to end the conflict in Syria so we can return home to our lives. Now I am stuck … my future is as a refugee, unable to move around freely and unable to work. I miss my country, my home, my neighbours; but my country was destroyed.

Bombs were exploding next to us on a daily basis. In 2002 the situation escalated and I left Kashmir for a neighboring village in order to save my life. After this crisis, the economy of Kashmir could not recover at once; it would take time, which I could not spend. I come from a family of 11, which means that we had many needs. As the youngest of nine brothers and sisters – who were already married – it was up to me to support my parents. In 2006 my parents arranged my marriage to my wife. In July 2007 I left for Europe. I left with a backpack filled in with a few clothes, a bottle of water and some food, my only belongings for my new life in Europe. The journey started in July 2007, crossing Pakistan by truck and bus. Of the 40-50 people of my group, the majority were from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. In Iran, we had to cross the mountains so that we wouldnt be tracked down by the police. We hid during the day and walked all night, in the bitter cold of the mountains. I remember wearing a thick jacket, two jumpers, two pairs of trousers and two pair of socks. We huddled together to get warm, you could die of cold. The trip was really difficult and we did not have enough food. Smugglers didnt give us food on a daily basis, and if I didnt have my own I wouldnt have survived, I was hungry all the time. It took us 15 days to walk from Pakistan to Iran. We crossed Iran mainly on foot. It was very painful and discouraging. When we reached Turkey, the smugglers drove us by cars, five persons per car each time, in order not to raise any suspicions. All 40 or 50 of us stayed together in a house and then we got on a truck which took us to Greece 15 days later. My first year in Greece was really difficult, I had no friends or family. I craved to return to my wife, who I had abandoned a few months after we got married. I wanted to return, to make a new start, but I couldnt afford to leave Greece. I spent many years working in greenhouses in Crete and took various jobs in Athens. I applied for asylum in 2012 but it was rejected in 2016 and now I go back to my country. I am glad that I am finally returning to Pakistan. With the assistance of the International Organization for Migration I will buy a cow and some goats and I will rebuild my farm. This time, I am going to Pakistan for good, to live with my wife, to grow our family and look after my parents."

He is entertaining, thought provoking, and is recognized by top professionals in the industry as a leader in pioneering exciting changes in author training and publishing. James is respected by aspiring and professional writers alike in Brazil, Portugal and many Spanish speaking countries, and the McSill Magic is known for taking the work of his authors to higher levels in literary worth and in sales -- by giving them a truly unique perspective on their work, not only from a creative standpoint, but also from James' broad-based experience: as a master in Linguistics, Business, and Materials Design. To the benefit of all, he has never flinched from weaving all his fields of knowledge into his private consultations and public talks and courses. He alone is responsible for assisting hundreds of authors a year with creating and writing their stories, and with his team also edits or acts as story consultant for upwards of two hundred books a year and organizes a myriad of workshops and training courses all over the Latin World. James has also been particularly engaged in guiding his many authors on the marketability of their projects for foreign markets. Not a stranger to technology, he has used the very latest innovations from conference calls to delivering training courses in 3D from his studio in the UK to remote locations across the world. In the words of the participants, working with James was not only a professional, but also a life changing experience. Unknown to many, James was a child actor and a playwright and enjoys dabbling with writing of his own (14 books published: romances, childrens stories, and technical books on storytelling). James McSill is based in his studio in Yorkshire, UK (www.storytelling.mcsill.com) and in his office in São Paulo, Brazil (www.agency.mcsill.com)."
445	James	South Sudan	Canada	A	N	far	1421	43560	H	im	male	I left my home country, Sudan (now South Sudan) when I was about 15 years old. I left mainly because I was searching for a safer environment for me to study without the daily fear of getting bombed or weighed down by responsibilities a child shouldnt bear. When I left, I had no idea that the place I was headed to would be a refugee camp and that Id be referred to as a refugee instead of my name or my nationality. I had an instant disillusionment when I arrived at Kakuma refugee camp. Together with nine other young unaccompanied boys, we spent over three weeks without any ration card. During this period, we depended on the little ration from other refugees who were kind enough to share with us. Another thing was the apparent insecurity in the refugee camp. A year after I came to Kakuma refugee camp, my closest classmate was shot at night by the local looters. I was highly traumatized by these experiences and felt like running back to my country though I knew it was also insecure. I eventually got to leave Kakuma refugee camp for Canada through a university scholarship program I hard-earned. As much as most Canadians are well informed and welcoming people, a few still have insufficient knowledge about refugees. When I came here, I learnt how some people perceive refugees as vulnerable people that only get by through mercies not merits. I miss my mother, siblings, relatives and my childhood friends. I can never trade them for any experiences that my travels have afforded me since I left home. I still consider South Sudan my home, although over the years I have moved on to appreciate the places I have been to and the people I have met along the way. I believe the story of everyone who is or was once a refugee entails resilience and I bring this to every country I go to, including here in Canada. My life inspires so many people that I encounter. More so, I bring different insights and experiences that are invaluable to the community I'm in. Currently, I am working on a solar-powered drip Irrigation System Project that is intended to help reduce food insecurity especially during the dry season by enabling communities to irrigate their farms. Once this pilot project takes off in Tonj, we will replicate it in other villages to help reduce hunger and malnutrition, alleviate poverty and resolve protracted inter-communal conflicts over limited resources and provide jobs to many jobless young people. I believe this will be my first step to give back to the positive transformation of South Sudans society which will ultimately contribute to a safer world. Young mens lives are wasted seated in ram shackled tin-roofed houses waiting for opportunities to grow intellectually and professionally which never come. Whenever I looked at this wasted human resource, my young heart would always skip in dismay and it still does.
446	James	South Sudan	United States	A	N	far	1421	63123	H	im	male	By Jamess eighth birthday, his country was plunged into a 20-year civil war in 1983 as South Sudan and the Sudanese government struggled over power and independence. In 1987, when South Sudan became too dangerous, he walked three months to Ethiopia with 18 other young boys. I became the father of the group, wondering everyday who among us is going to find us firewood? Take care of us? Cook? Go to school? Take someone to the clinic? I remember when we finally reached the refugee camp, we barely had any clothes and what we had was falling apart. Every once in a while we would receive clothing donations and draw straws for who would receive that piece of clothing. From Ethiopia, James eventually returned to South Sudan, but had to run again from the government, this time to Kenya. He later got married in Kenya, and his wife and first child relocated to Nairobi. They received resettlement assistance to move to Nebraska, United States, in 2008. Nebraska was completely different from East Africa, but he worked and went to school, eventually moving to Iowa to attend university. The struggle over finding clothes to wear as a young refugee stuck with James throughout his life. By the time he reached the United States, he chose not abandon his people. He started a charity called Clothing World Needy People, collecting clothes and fundraising to donate them to new refugees arriving in the United States and eventually to deliver to the families in South Sudan. His goal is to reach 200,000 people a year. James is also working with South Sudanese diaspora to open a clinic in his home state of Jonglei. So many South Sudanese grew up in war, didnt go to school and all they know was fighting. But, we need to teach people that peace is the key to economic development. There is no country for one tribe. A country is for everybody.

She had limited English but that didnt stop her from becoming a top tech executive for companies including Qantas. The village (where I was born) was very desolate, dusty, we had water in the wells,  Ms Gordon told SBS News. My mother was pregnant every year, or she had a baby . In the end, she had 16 children. Her family moved to Mogadishu to avoid a drought. But just before the civil war broke out they were separated. Ms Gordon was sent to live with distant relatives in Kenya. Through my friends in Kenya, I met an Australian backpacker. It was his second day in Kenya and we became friends, she said. They would later marry and she would move to Australia. She quickly learned English at TAFE and would go on to university in Melbourne to study accounting, before taking an IT elective and falling in love with it. But, she says, her first job in Australia was washing dishes, earning five dollars an hour. Ms Gordon says IT had some surprising similarities to her first school in Somalia. The process I used to memorise the Koran in the village where I was born, was exactly the same as the process of software programming that I used when I was at Latrobe University, Ms Gordon said. After university she got a job as a software programmer and climbed her way up the ladder, working in Europe for major companies including IBM. She later returned to Australia to become chief information officer at Qantas. She is currently based in Sydney and works with smaller tech start-ups, helping them get off the ground. Rod Bishop CEO of Jayride, a start-up marketplace for transport hire, says working with Ms Gordon has been a perfect fit. There's really not a lot of growth-focused technology people operating at an extremely high level in Australia. So it was an absolute pleasure and we saw eye to eye straight away, Mr Bishop said. Former professional colleague David Thodey, who is the chairman of the board at CSRIO, says Jamila brings a unique approach to her work. She's always had a vision for what she wanted to do, but a great determination and incredible will and drive to get the job done.

She needed to adapt, and decided to diversify her business and invest into a grains and cereals business. She is selling maize, rice, groundnuts and soybeans at the Ganga market in Walewale. Today, her daughter is going to school, and with the profits of her business Jamilatu is able to take care of her family, including her brother and his two sons. My name is Jamilatu Sulemana. Im from Walewale. Im 30 years old. I travelled to Libya. Why did I travel? I was in Accra selling secondhand clothes. The savings I used to do my business got finished. One day, a friend called me. She said she got a chance for me to travel to Libya for work. But I said I dont have money to travel and if I am going to travel who will pay for my travel expenses. She said the agents will pay and once we get to Libya, we will work and pay back. We worked for three months. One day, I went out to buy food and some policemen started calling me. They requested my passport and said that it had expired. I was arrested and sent to the police station. I spent three months in prison with my infant daughter until I decided to return to Ghana with the help of IOM.It was the biggest relief for me and my daughter. Back in Ghana, I received a container which I could use for my business. I also received financial help to stock the container with maize, soybeans, shea nuts and groundnuts. Then, coronavirus hit us and affected my sales. So I said to myself, I have to sustain the investment I was given by IOM. I decided to invest into farming and other food stuffs. Now, I can take care of my daughter, father and mother, as well as the children of my late brother.

I decided to stay for longer than my degree, and began working in London as an environmental consultant working on energy and climate change policy. This was followed by a PhD in Energy Efficiency Policy at Oxford University whilst working as a freelance consultant. Since 2013, I lead the energy efficiency policy work of a large energy and climate change consultancy based in Oxford. A lot of our clients are not in the UK and I work from the European Commission with other companies across Europe and clients based in France, Germany, Jersey, and Bosnia. Many of our colleagues are immigrants who speak several languages, and we need them– a lot of our work requires both different language and cultural skills. In addition to my consultancy work, I continue doing research on how to build a more sustainable world that consumes less energy and is more socially just. My two children were born in the UK and I have many friends in here now, both British and non-British. In short, I like it here. However, Ive noticed that the atmosphere regarding immigration has changed here recently. When I arrived in 2006 immigration was seen as hugely beneficial and I never felt like an outsider. Unfortunately, this has changed a lot and the debate has become very toxic, separating people into 'us' and 'the others. I think that immigration is one of the things that has made this country great. If the debate continues to be one-sided and if the blame is on immigrants for all sorts of problems, people will think twice about whether they want to come and stay here or instead live in a country where being immigrant is not an issue but celebrated (applications from international students are already on the decline). This will have significant economic and cultural consequences, and will turn the country I liked so much for its openness when I arrived into a closed and xenophobic place. Honestly, is this the Britain we want to create?
451	Janit	Philippines	Jordan	I	M	far	3299	4283	E	im	female	"I come from a small island in the Philippines, where I used to live with my family in a house next to a sandy beach in a very beautiful place. I moved to Kuwait when I was 18 years old, where I worked until I met my Kuwaiti boyfriend. He was 23 years old and we lived together for six months until we decided to move to the Philippines and start our lives there. He even bought fishing boats to help my family start a fishing business. I got pregnant and gave birth to my little boy. It was great until we wanted to get married. He wanted to get married in Kuwait, in the Islamic way. At first, I didnt have a problem with this until he asked me to follow his religion and wear the hijab. I didnt like the idea of wearing the hijab and this is what I told him, but he couldnt handle it and as a result, we broke up and he left to Kuwait. I stayed with my new born son and my father took over the fishing business, which he didnt manage very well and the business ended shortly after. I needed to leave and search for a job and that is how I ended up in Jordan, working first as a waitress and after that as a maid. Jordan is a nice place, I have some Jordanian friends who are very nice to me, but now, I really miss my son, family, house, swimming and eating coconuts. Whenever I visit my home in the Philippines once a year, my whole family gathers in a house next to the sandy beach where we sing, dance, eat and talk about all the things that we have missed. My son is 18 years old now and he wants to become a captain of a ship, like his uncle. I fully support his goals. Im very satisfied with the person that he has become. He has a great desire to meet his father, with whom I have lost contact; if he is reading this I want him to know that his son (Mohammad Ali Aque) would like to meet him one day."
452	Jaouad	Morocco	Belgium	A	E	far	3108	45028	H	im	male	The future for us in Morocco was uncertain for my entire family, so we decided to go to Belgium. This decision has had a positive effect on both my sport and the education of my brothers and sisters. In less than 5 years he learned three languages, adopted himself to the Belgian society and became a Taekwondo miracle ranking number one in the world in the ultra-competitive mens under 63kg category, further winning two European titles and one Word title and participated in the Rio 2016 Olympics where he ended fifth. This all while representing his adoptive country Belgium. Since I became Belgian, in every competition I always represent Belgium and run around with the Belgian flag because this country gave me the opportunity to become who I am today. I am Belgian, I am here and I am home. Almost my entire family is still in Morocco. I miss them. I miss my club where I started Taekwondo when I was a child, I miss the streets and my friends. Whenever I can, I go to visit them. Morocco is my home county so deep inside I feel more Moroccan than Belgian. I travel a lot, I go around the world and the most beautiful thing is to see how other people live. Their culture, the language they speak, the currencies they use, their religion and so on. I always learn from them. Leaving your country is very difficult. You need to learn the culture, the language, and the habits. You might even be confronted with racism. However, it is very satisfying when you speak the language and you feel youre giving something back to the society you were welcomed in. As a migrant in Belgium I believe I have done the best I could have possibly done and I am still hungry to do much more.

He arrived in Romania at the end of 2017, after first travelling through Lebanon and then Turkey. For a young man like him, the decision to leave his home, family and friends was made after the war started taking away any sense of certainty and stability. During the war, the chances of finding a good job and following your dreams seem utterly impossible for most, setting aside the fact that lives are in danger. Jbara chose to come to Romania to reunite with his uncle that had already been living there for more than 20 years. When I first arrived here I was a little scared, arriving in a new country seemed overwhelming, even if I had someone I knew here, Jbara explained. I had no idea what to do when I came to Romania, or how to find my way around. Fortunately, everyone I met was really welcoming. The people working at IOM Romania helped me a lot and changed my [original] impressions. I miss my family and my friends in Syria the most, a lot of them stayed back in Aleppo. If I think about home, the image and feel of the soft sand comes into my mind. Living in Romania has not been without challenges so far, but meeting people with a nice attitude has helped a lot.  Settling in Romania is part of Jbara's plan; he wants to open a business that will connect the two countries. His biggest challenge for the moment is learning the Romanian language, but he follows his friends advice to listen to the radio and to Romanian music every day. He often thinks about the people back home, and hopes that they find ways to stay united and agree with each other. Nevertheless, he is adjusting to his new reality away from his beloved country. Home will always be in Syria for me, but Romania is my adoptive country, Jbara concluded."
454	Jean	Haiti	Ecuador	L	L	close	1360	5600	E	im	female	"When I lived in Haiti, I used to study business management. In 2010, the earthquake struck and a year later the situation became very difficult for young people. It wasnt easy for us to continue our studies. This is when we found a religious organization that worked there and had links with Ecuador. They were dedicated to helping young Haitians who wished to continue their studies by offering them a scholarship. We would only have to pay for the flights. My family realized this was a great opportunity and made all the efforts possible to gather enough money for the ticket, which cost almost 2,000 US Dollars. I had never thought I would move to another country. In fact, I was always more interested in contributing to the development of Haiti by helping those who need it the most. However, given the conditions, I accepted to come to Ecuador. My plan was to study here and go back to Haiti with all the knowledge I would have acquired. Unfortunately, when we arrived in Ecuador the organization had deceived us and kept all of our money. I had entered the country with a tourist visa which would soon expire so I sought help from many institutions and was eventually given a contract to work in a dietary sugar processing plant. I worked there for almost two years but I eventually had to leave because I had no papers. My objective was, however, to keep studying. With great effort, I managed to get into university and continue my studies in business management. I then I found a part-time job and I am now in my fourth year at university. Then I found the Human Mobility Unit of the Provincial Government of Pichincha where I received the legal advice I needed and through the project implemented with the support of the *Joint Migration and Development Initiative, the Unit team pointed me in the right direction and helped me get the visa I needed to ensure my papers were all in order. My goal is to return to Haiti and contribute to its development. Haiti is a country where some people still live in slavery – not physically, but psychologically. We are out of the worlds reality; it is as if we were disconnected. In this sense, my migratory process has taught me a lot about what I can do to contribute to my countrys development. Now, Ecuador is my second home. There is a writer who says: a country that gives you education, that gives you food, even for a short while, is also your home. I thank Ecuador because this has been a great country for me and I feel like I have also been able to help because I have been teaching French to groups of people both in my church and my university. This experience has left its mark on me. It has taught me that migration is something anyone in the world could experience at some point during their life. It means leaving your country and living in a different culture. It means diving into a new reality and picking yourself up every time you fall. *The Joint Migration and Development Initiative is an inter-agency programme led by UNDP in collaboration with IOM, ITC-ILO, UNITAR, UNCHR, UN Women and UNFPA and financed by the European Commission and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation."
455	Jean-Pierre Kidum	Burundi	Kenya	A	A	close	286	1879	H	im	male	"Born in Burundi in 1974, Jean Pierre Nimbona, popularly known in East Africa as Kidum fled the country in 1995, after it was thrown into turmoil following a civil war. He moved to Kenya where he later launched a successful music career and became a household name. As part of efforts to contribute to peace in his home country, in 2001, he participated in a peace concert at the invitation of the countrys former President, Pierre Buyoya. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also invited him to perform at a peace concert. The crooner, who sings both secular and gospel songs, has also performed in Belgium and London, amongst other locations. Kidum is still connected to Burundi in many ways. For instance, with a keen interest in farming, he is a productive subsistence farmer in Burundi. Though he still lives in Kenya, he aspires in future to play a greater role in changing the social economic sectors of his motherland. In 1995, I was forced to flee my home country, Burundi, following a long running civil war. Fearing I might join the fighting, my father gave me USD 60 and told me to flee to Kenya and pursue my dream as a musician there. Upon my arrival in Kenya, I teamed up with a Tanzanian national, Saidi Kinyunda and we formed a band and performed in various entertainment spots. For three years, recording studios turned us down and in 1999 we formed Hot Rod band and approached a Nairobi based producer, Maurice Ayado, who agreed to record our first hit Yaramenje. It was an instant hit amongst the fans who were familiar with our genre of music. At the beginning life in Kenya wasnt easy. I got arrested many times in police swoops on suspected undocumented migrants. The swoops targeted urban refugees with an intention of soliciting bribes in exchange for our short lived freedom. Kenyans on the other hand, viewed us as petty thieves, cheats and miscreants. When I arrived in Kenya, the majority of Kenyans mostly listened to foreign music. So we started singing in Swahili, and within years, we became a household name. I can proudly say I was one of the artists who made Kenyans listen to Swahili songs. Today, 90 percent of songs including mine that are sung or played in most entertainment venues are in Swahili. I was also one of the first artists to perform both secular and religious songs too. But i also think that Its important that migrants should contribute to the host country; they should pay taxes as well as contribute economically. In my case, Kenya is home away from home. I have tried to empower Burundian migrants here in Kenya through music. This is my fifth band, since 1995, most of the back-up musicians, are not only Burundians, but also Tanzanians and Rwandese. I use my music as a force for social change. Kenyans identify with my music and this is important."
456	Jelena	Serbia	Hungary	E	E	close	7656	16129	E	im	female	Its hard to say but before I moved to Hungary, I was ashamed to say that Im Roma. Everyone else knew. I couldnt hide it, but I preferred not to talk about it. My father taught me and my brother that were not Roma. He did that because he had been discriminated against his entire life. I started working in the field of Roma inclusion, but I wasnt happy with my workplace, partly because of the rather sexist, all-male leadership. My professor told me about a program for Roma university graduates at the Central European University in Budapest. When I came here in 2011, I thought Oh my God, Im gonna die. I couldnt speak English or Hungarian. My friend from Serbia lived here and she asked her Canadian boyfriend to pick me up at the train station. I was terrified, thinking OK, he can come here but I cant communicate with him either. I just said coffee? and cigarettes? to him because I desperately needed these before hed put me in a taxi and send me to my new home. But then the first person I met at the dorm could speak Macedonian (a very similar language to Serbian) and she was also from the same program. From that point onwards I felt safe. The Roma Graduate Preparation Program was a life-changing experience. I overcame my identity issue, learned a lot and made great friends. It was a specific environment because we understood and supported each other. I used to be ashamed because your environment teaches you that its not good to be Roma. You hear bad things about Roma and you dont want to be connected to what people say. I felt bad about myself and I felt bad about saying the word Roma in public. But Im not ashamed anymore. And I say this in public whenever it makes sense, not only because now Im free to say this but because its political. Its important because it still happens that people wonder how come you are so educated? Its offensive because they say these things believing they will make you feel good by differentiating you from other Roma. I want to attach more positive values to the meanings of the concept. Hungarian language is an issue. I never tried because I dont need it for my work and my friends are still mostly from the same international environment. But sometimes I feel like I miss out on small things that are actually really important in life. For example, I had very nice elderly neighbors. They tried to show their kindness in different ways even though we couldnt speak to each other. I had moments when I wanted to give them something I made or brought from Serbia but I couldnt, I was feeling uncomfortable. I established very strong relationships with people here. I met people who are close to me in terms of experiences and interests. Its not about belonging to a community racially, ethnically or nationally or having a common culture but we have experiences, fears and hopes to share. Its about constant learning.
457	Jenan	United States	United States	N	N	close	63123	63123	E	hc	female	"Growing up in a multicultural household was confusing. I remember being confused; there is no other word for it. I was not allowed to do things that my American friends were allowed to do, I was doing things differently than my American friends were doing. I was eating different food. Normal American kids would bring snack pack or a lunchable box - that was the thing in the 90s when I was a kid - and Id be coming with falafel and hummus sandwiches and trying to explain to my friends why I am eating a sandwich with a yoghurt cheese spread inside. They all thought it was gross. So there was always a piece of me that was different no matter what group of people I was trying to fit in with. Being the daughter of two immigrants, I feel I have to work twice as hard as my friends whose families have been here for generations just so I can prove to my family it was worth it for them to come here and to make this journey and start their lives all over again. Being a child of immigrants, it means balancing two different cultures. Growing up I had a hard time accepting that I was part of these two different worlds that are so conflicting. However, coming from a culturally diverse background, I think it is absolutely a benefit, its made me more open-minded. I have more of a curiosity for the outside world and for getting out of my bubble, my comfort zone. I love learning about other cultures and other religions. I think it is definitely beneficial to my life to have this diverse background."
458	Jennifer	Sierra Leone	United States	A	N	far	475	63123	H	im	female	Sierra Leone had suffered a brutal civil war that lasted a decade and left tens of thousands killed, amputated and without shelter. The aftermath of the war cut deeper than any blade and left long term scars on Sierra Leones economy. I faced two options – stay home where a dire future awaited me, or move thousands of miles away, take a scholarship I had won and build a brighter future for myself, my family, and those I hoped to impact. I left my home, Sierra Leone, at the age of 16 to pursue education in the United States. I have felt a strong sense of purpose for as long as I can remember – to help minimize human suffering. My purpose has been influenced by my parents who sacrificed a comfortable life in the western world to care for the health and education deprived in Sierra Leone. Due to my experiences growing up in in Sierra Leone, I have chosen to alleviate human suffering by addressing health inequity, which I feel fortunate to say I have begun to address through my non-profit, World Health Equity. Coming to the US represented an opening up of my world to opportunities that are non-existent in Sierra Leone. Among many others, these opportunities have included a high quality education that has empowered me to plan and execute global health projects to address maternal and infant health disparities not only in my home country, but in the US as well. My first and lasting impression of the USA has been one of appreciation for resources I would otherwise not be have access to, resources I have been able to use to empower myself and others who are less fortunate. I grew up without a computer or internet in Sierra Leone, and came to university in the US where everything was computer-based. I walked into a university lecture during my first semester to find students head down, working on an exam. I had no idea we had an exam on that day and had to take it unprepared. It turns out the exam schedule was posted on the university class schedule website, instead of communicated to students verbally in class. I felt like I had been hit by a culture that was a century in the future compared to the one I had come from. Following that episode, I checked the university class website religiously and made sure to double and triple check exam and homework schedules with professors following. I am also more conscientious about communicating things that may not be as intuitive to people from other cultures, in order to avoid a similar mishap in the future! Being both Sierra Leonean and Ukrainian, I found it challenging, yet exciting, to learn and adapt to the American way of life. I have made a point to explore this experience in the USA to the fullest. But this doesnt go without a sense of longing for my home country. I miss the warm-hearted people, culture, food and beach each day. Home will always be where my family is – Sierra Leone. However having now spent a third of my life in the US, I have begun to consider it home too. I have made wonderful friends who have become my family in the US, and who make this melting pot of cultures feel more like home me each day. Jennifer is the Founder and CEO of World Health Equity.

459	Jenny A.	Honduras	Finland	L	E	far	2406	48685	H	im	female	I arrived to Helsinki 26 years ago through a cultural exchange program. It wasnt the first time I moved between cities, but it was the first time I switched countries. The cultural shock I experienced was very strong, but I adapted gradually. When I came to Finland, I started working at a childrens camp. There I met people from different nationalities, all ranging from Europe to Latin-America. It was easier to get along with the Latin community, because unlike Europeans, we are more cheerful. I met some difficulties when seeking employment in the engineering field, mainly because I didnt have a good grasp of the Finnish language. Nevertheless, I dedicated my ability to speak English and my strong drive to be productive to the internships I had for different offices. In 1990, I moved to Kokkola, a city on the western side of the country. I constantly received many compliments on my black hair and dark eyes. I quickly noticed that the people here had blonde hair and blue eyes. So, in a way, I stood out wherever I went! Cultural diversity in Finland has grown considerably over recent years. Nowadays, I have more friends to talk with in Spanish. My children now also have the opportunity to keep in touch with their Latin roots. Honduran customs contrast sharply with those of Finland´s. When raising my three children I focused a lot in inculcating the Latin perspective on family union. Where I come from, people have strong attachments to their family and parents have a predominant role on the lives of their kids. On the other hand, in Finland the parenting style is not the same. Despite the differences, my husband and I agreed that raising our children between two cultures would help them build new social skills.

462	Jessy	Sao Tome and Principe	Portugal	A	E	far	2174	22413	H	im	male	I was born in Água Grande in São Tomé and Príncipe, but I grew up with my grand-mother in the Bom Bom region because my mother had moved to Portugal to work and help my family from abroad. It was never my wish to come to Portugal, but fifteen years ago my mother decided it was better for me to join her. I did not know anything about Portugal before moving here. The first thing I noticed when I arrived was how quiet it felt here and that there were many buildings. I moved to the fifth floor of an eleven-floor tower and I had never been in such a tall building before because houses in São Tomé are all small. I remember taking the stairs the first time as I went up to my floor — I was in awe of the view and the landscape. Today I enjoy living in Lisbon – whats important is being healthy, and having a job and a place to live, be it in Portugal or elsewhere. When I arrived in Portugal I couldn't go to school for one year because I had an irregular residency status. We spent so many days waking up at 5 am to go to the Social Security Centre. The queues were gigantic, it was horrible. I have always enjoyed learning, so eventually I was able to continue studying and I finished high school. I already had experience as a hairdresser and cosmetologist in São Tomé and I also used to go to some of my clients houses to make some money. I finished my last year of high school under a regular migration status, then I decided to get training as a hair dresser and obtain a certificate so that I could work in a salon. My best memories from Portugal are all related to my time at school. I had really good teachers. My geography teacher was particularly helpful and she always took time after class to help me do my homework, including in subjects beyond geography. I am thankful for her support to help me graduate. I miss São Tomés beach and the sea there. The water in Portugal does not feel so inviting to me. Going to the beach for me equals diving in the water and going for walks – not staying under the sun. I also miss the food and the dancing. We tend to live more in community and there are more opportunities for leisure and fun – in São Tomé there is always a party happening for no particular reason. I wish I had met more understanding people when I arrived in Portugal. Coming from abroad, one is normally not familiar with the way things work here and it is easy to feel alone. There are twice as many obstacles in the beginning and one does not know who to go to for help. I live in a rented room at the moment, but my next step will be to be able to live alone. One day, I would like to go back to São Tomé and Príncipe.
463	Jim Yong	Republic of Korea	United States	I	N	far	31947	63123	E	im	male	"In 1964, I came to the United States from South Korea, then an extremely poor developing country that most experts, including those at the World Bank, had written off as having little hope for economic growth. My family moved to Texas, and later to Iowa. I was just 5 years old when we arrived, and my brother, sister, and I spoke no English. Most of our neighbors and classmates had never seen an Asian before. I felt like a resident alien in every sense of the term. Over time, my family integrated into our adopted homeland, which in many ways has come to understand the benefits of diversity and multiculturalism. Still, as Pope Francis so powerfully underscored in his remarks to Congress last month, the United States — a nation built by immigrants — needs to do more to embrace the stranger in our midst. My experience as a migrant was not easy, but it was nothing compared to the odysseys endured by the millions of refugees who have been moving by foot, train, boat, and car, first to neighboring countries and more recently into Europe, to flee unremitting brutality. The differences between refugees such as Syrians, whose lives have been torn apart by war, and economic migrants like me are enormous. For host countries, resettling refugees and opening doors to migrants can present different challenges. But just as an inflow of working-age migrants to a country with an aging population can benefit all parties, an influx of refugees can be an asset to those countries, including those with limited resources, that take them in. About 86% of refugees worldwide are hosted by developing countries. For example, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan host 3.7 million Syrian refugees combined, more than eight times the number taken in by European countries. In 2014, the major host countries for refugees, excluding Palestinians, were Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, Iran, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kenya, Chad, Uganda, and China. Turkey has 1.9 million Syrian refugees, more than any other country. The Turkish government has spent more than $7.6 billion on the refugee response. It also has allowed the majority of these registered refugees to stay outside of camps, given them freedom of movement and protection against forced return, and attended to their immediate needs. The refugees have access to health care and increasing access to education. How has this affected Turkeys economy? Many of those Syrians who arrived with assets have invested in Turkey. In 2014, Syrians accounted for 26% of the new foreign businesses registered in Turkey. Recent analysis by the World Bank shows that while the influx of Syrians has displaced Turkish workers from the informal labor market, those workers have also benefited from a greater formalization of the labor market, which has allowed them to move into formal jobs with better wages. Preliminary findings suggest that poverty rates fell faster in regions hosting Syrian refugees than elsewhere; more study is needed to learn whether the refugees arrival was a contributing factor. At the same time, though, the large number of Syrians in Jordan and Lebanon have vastly increased the overall demand for water, electricity, schools, and hospitals, placing great strains on those countries. The international community has contributed humanitarian aid to the refugees and, to a limited extent, to the host countries. But much more is needed. Today, on average, a refugee can expect to remain a refugee for 17 years. So we need to move beyond humanitarian assistance to development solutions. If host countries can create a path for refugees to participate in their economies — as Turkey is doing — everybody benefits. These benefits are even greater when rich countries, especially those with declining populations, take in refugees. Most of the evidence suggests that refugees, like economic migrants in general, work hard and contribute more in taxes than they consume in social services. I was recently in South Korea, where I raised the issue of accepting immigrants, whether they are from neighboring Asian countries or anywhere else. I asked whether a person from Indonesia or Tanzania or Syria could ever become a hyphenated Korean, as Ive become a Korean-American. The answers I received made it clear that, despite the great benefits that Koreans have derived from being able to move to all corners of the earth, Syrian-Koreans probably will not be accepted as full members of Korean society anytime soon. But South Korea, like many wealthier countries, has an aging population, and it needs an influx of younger workers to continue on its remarkable path of economic growth. The great challenge for many advanced economies is to manage such changes and welcome migrants and refugees with a plan to help them settle and perhaps eventually become citizens, just as I became a citizen of the United States at the age of 12. This is a smart strategy, especially during these times of low global economic growth. Countries that welcome refugees, and help other countries to productively host them, will be doing the right thing — both for our fellow human beings who are suffering and for the global economy.

465	Joanna	Poland	Estonia	E	E	close	15764	23106	E	im	female	When my boss asked me if I wanted to go and work in Estonia, I only knew where Estonia was located on the map, nothing else. So I thought — why not, let the adventure begin! Now, I couldnt be happier to have ended up here. What I like the most about Estonia is the greenery. I like all the forests and bogs and stone beaches. And Tartu, my home town, is amazing because its so green, we have parks at every corner! I also find Estonia very liberating. People respect their own freedom and privacy and expect the same from others. And it works! Nobody here cares whether youre a believer, go to church, with whom you live, what clothes you wear. I really love the bohemian side of Tartu and how people express themselves — girls especially have such an interesting sense of style. For example, they wear yellow trousers and a bright blue coat! It has made me more comfortable in my skin. In Poland, before any job interview, I had to cover my tattoos, I couldnt have crazy colours in my hair and I had to be normal but here I feel very comfortable with myself the way I am. Poland, aside from the politics, religion and everything that makes us angry, is a beautiful country and I like to introduce Estonian people to its nature and cities, the cuisine, music and traditions. This is very important to me. I enjoy meeting other Polish friends here to gossip in Polish but I also have many local and international friends — there's a big mix! Im trying to befriend people from many different countries, because I like learning about new cultures and languages. Im also learning Estonian but Im the kind of creep who goes to a shop and reads all the labels, I dont attend any courses! I also have a very nice neighbour, an elderly lady who always likes to drop by for a conversation in Estonian. When I dont understand something, she says the word louder or slower — or both! I find it really sweet and in general it hasnt happened that someone was unkind to me in Estonia, the people are very welcoming. I think Poland and Estonia have many similarities. When I first saw the Estonian cuisine, I thought: wow, this is like my grannys food! The main difference between Estonia and Poland, Id say is the nature of the people. Polish people are very loud, they like to have fun, drink, they smile at everyone. In Estonia, everyone lives in their bubble: if someone lets you in, youre their best friend but otherwise they tend to be reserved. But I like to call myself an extraverted introvert so I really appreciate the days when I can close myself in my bubble, like the perfect Estonian, with a grumpy face and a book. I think Estonia is a very underrated country, nobody knows where it is and whats going on here. I think everyone should just look it up on the map and come see it! Its hidden, its small, not many people know about it but those who do end up here are always amazed. So when you do come here, dont just stay in the cities but get into the wild: go see the Peipsi coast, the gulf of Finland, the beautiful parks like Lahemaa, go to Viljandi. Just take all the routes you can and enjoy what Estonia has to offer!
466	Joanna	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	female	I attended a taught masters in artificial intelligence (AI) at Edinburgh in 1991-1992. I paid for it myself with money I'd saved while working after University. After my masters degree I did a PhD back in the USA at a leading university, but I liked the European way of doing artificial intelligence better. And the universities here like what I do too. Now I've been teaching and leading a research team at Bath since 2002. My team works on making artificial intelligence easier to understand and use. We also use artificial intelligence to do scientific modelling to help us understand how people come to work together – when we cooperate and when we compete. I've also taught over a thousand students how to program computers, and hundreds how to program robots and computer game AI. It's hard to be apart from your family sometimes, but it's important for an academic to work where their research and knowledge can do the most good. One of my American friends thinks it's wrong to have taken my American education overseas, but I think the work academics do helps everyone in the world.
467	Joannah	United Kingdom	France	E	E	close	40718	38959	E	im	female	I grew up in the UK, and left at 25 to study in Duisburg, Germany. Tuition fees were more affordable and I was studying German linguistics and society, so it made sense to be there. I had spent some time in Germany before as an Erasmus student in Berlin, which made it easy to adjust to my new life there. I didnt encounter any language barriers because I already spoke the language and, importantly, my move was voluntary. At 31, I moved from Germany to live in France and work in Switzerland. Borders became a big part of my life! My partner's job brought us to the Geneva area, and it also brought me an opportunity. I had always wanted to work either at a university or with the United Nations and being in Geneva allowed me to try my hand at moving into the international arena. After lots of job applications and working with two other organizations, I found the perfect fit working in research communications at UNRISD (UN Research Institute for Social Development) in the Palais des Nations, the UN's European Headquarters. I speak French and was reasonably familiar with Swiss culture before the move, two factors that helped make the transition to life in Geneva smooth. But music is also key to my integration. I started playing violin when I was 7 because my best friend played. She stopped a year or two later, but I've kept playing ever since. In every place where I have lived, I have always joined an orchestra and found new friends. Being in the UN Orchestra gives me an extra buzz because it lets me combine two things I love: making music and being in an international, multilingual community. Music gives me balance. I work mostly with my left brain, so making music lets me engage the right brain. After rehearsals I get an emotional high which lasts me until the next practice! I am a migrant, but I consider myself one of the lucky ones because I have had the  incredible privilege of choosing when and where to move in my life. Many people do not have this choice, simply because of where they were born and who their parents are, and many more need to be allowed to make that choice as a matter of survival. We all have to work together to fight this global injustice that makes migration a question of luck.
468	Joao	Portugal	Mauritania	E	A	far	22413	1702	L	im	male	"Joao arrived in Mauritania six years ago working as a hotel manager for a Portuguese company. Then, he obtained a contract with the embassy of the United States as caterer. As Joao says, he is a self-made man, he believes that if you are motivated and you love what you do, nothing is impossible. So while working at the embassy, he created his own safe heaven: La Casa Portuguesa. From outside it seems to be a normal restaurant, but behind the door is hidden a mini home-made mall. A restaurant, a shop, a bed and breakfast, a hairdresser and a massage room. A very quiet spot born from the efforts of a determined man. I have made many sacrifices to create this place with my partner, to make guests and myself happy, because that is also important. Patience is my major virtue. I have to admit; daily life in Mauritania is not always easy. It is a very different place from where I grew up and when you are in a foreign country without your family, you feel the differences even more. Since he is also a nutritional expert and chef, he started organising workshops on hygiene and food safety, as those notions are almost unknown here. Sharing information and exchanging cultures is very important. I do not teach only the Portuguese cuisine but also the Asian, the Japanese, the Mediterranean and the African ones and the functioning of bacteria and the basics rules of a healthy nutrition. At the Casa Portuguesa, food and culture are mixed, as well as the locals and expats. The staff is also a melting pot: two Senegalese, an Ivorian and two Mauritanians are working for us. Since he arrived in Mauritania, Joao invested his energy and money in for a new life. That might be the secret of a successful migration."
469	John	Democratic Republic of the Congo	United States	A	N	far	506	63123	H	im	male	I long for the day my country will be stable, I wish for peace, stability, I wish for the day children and their parents and grandparents can come out to the streets and sing and dance without fear of the militia or army beating and killing us. I am extremely happy to be getting this opportunity to start afresh in the United States of America. After all that I have gone through I never thought I would see this day. I will maximize on the opportunity to one day bring peace back in my country. John arrived in Kenya in August of 2010 by road through the Malaba, the Kenya -Uganda border, prior to this he lived in Mbarara located in the Western Region of Uganda. When he arrived in Nairobi, he was received by a Kenyan man who was aware of his arrival and immediately took him to the suburb of Kasarani. Here I met many of my countrymen who had lived here as refugees and I was happy, although I did not speak or understand Kiswahili, most of the people there understood English. I felt at home and I felt safe. In 2012, John received a call from IOM requesting him to come for medical examinations as is standard procedure during the resettlement process. He took this as a sign that he was about to start a new journey, a new chapter in his life. Filled with confidence he made his way to the Migration Health Assessment Center in Nairobi. He was strong and healthy and nothing was going to deter him in achieving his goals. When his x-ray results came back they revealed scars on his lungs and the sputum tested positive for Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB). I saw death staring at me in the eye, I thought to myself, this is it, finally the devil has caught up with me, he says lowering his voice. In North Kivu, where John comes from, they have an expression igituntu cyomumaraso which means TB is in the blood and cannot be cured, ones only fate is death. I thought of all I was hoping to achieve and now this, I honestly regretted wanting to go abroad, had I not been to IOM I would not have known about all this.  John did not show signs of suffering from TB, he was not coughing and had no fever, he however had lost his appetite and consequently lost a lot of weight something he associated with stress, especially his lack of income. This marked the beginning of a 2 year stint in IOMs MDR-TB clinic in Dadaab. Through the support of the team at the clinic, John was able to finish his treatment and proceed with the resettlement process. He is now fully healed, has remained in excellent health and in July 2015, he departed for the United States.   Migrants face higher exposure to TB infection due to overcrowded living conditions. They often do not have access to correct TB related information on prevention, transmission and latent infections due to language barriers as well as cultural beliefs.
470	John	Egypt	Italy	A	E	far	3609	31238	H	im	male	My family migrated from Egypt in the late 1970s. My uncle first, and then my father came to Milan as migrants to find a job and an opportunity to help their family in Egypt. My grandfather died young and his two elder sons did their best to support the rest of their siblings in getting an education and having a decent life in Cairo. My parents got married in Egypt – they were friends at university – and my mother moved to Italy without a permit to stay. They decided to relocate to Venice where they found jobs in the tourism industry. After I was born, my parents decided to send me to my grandmother in Cairo, where I spent my first few years. I returned to Italy a couple of years later when my parents obtained a permit of stay. Many people see the status of an immigrant as a weakness, but I have tried to leverage my participation in two different cultures and turn it into one of my biggest assets. Being a foreigner in the northern region of Italy was not always easy—there are still some biases toward Middle Easterners, but I did my best to maintain ties with my country of origin: I learned Arabic, and completed an internship in Cairo which focused on international business in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region. Being part of two cultures and different worlds is a great competitive advantage in my career. That was what really made me distinctive and boosted my path to success. Rethinking my identity and redefining myself not as an Egyptian who had to migrate to Italy, but as a European, who understands the Middle East and its complexities, was a tipping point. I participate in Egyptian culture and traditions through my family, but have also tried to become part of the country where I actually live. Now I maintain my ties to the Middle East both through family and my work as Special Consul at a law firm in Milan. Orrick often assists Italian companies that are investing – directly and/or indirectly – in Egypt and vice-versa. However, the most important success achieved in working between the two countries was a case in which we, with the support of many friends both Italian and Egyptian, helped a child heavily burned during the 2011 turmoil to receive medical attention at the University of Padua.
471	Jonathan	France	Viet Nam	E	I	far	38959	2786	L	im	male	My life back in France was not a very good experience for me due to many unfortunate incidents in my personal life. I did not feel happy and was not satisfied with it in a way. Leaving was just a dream for me, a dream to start over with a new life, a dream to have a second chance.  It was a distant dream and I had never thought that I would be able to make it happen. With a nice surprise, the opportunity came when a friend of mine in France asked me to join him in opening new business in Vietnam. Before France I had lived in Brazil for three months but I had no  previous experience in Asia. Vietnam was not necessarily my first choice, but I like to think of it as my destiny. So I did not think twice before choosing to follow my instinct and taking part in this adventure. The first chapter of my life in Vietnam was not easy at all. I could not speak  English or Vietnamese. As a consequence, even the simplest things turned out to be very difficult. Therefore, I tried to learn English wherever and whenever I could. It took me a few months to be able to communicate confidently in English. Now I am focusing on studying Vietnamese, which is actually quite difficult. However, it would make it easier to expand my business and integrate with the local community. Now it has been six years since I moved to Vietnam, and my life has completely changed. I feel comfortable here and very much integrated into Vietnamese society. At the moment, I am managing a business of my own and can do things I enjoy every day. Home is where I want to be, with people I enjoy being around. Basically it could be anywhere, but for me, it is Vietnam.  I would not have everything I have today if I had not chosen to leave that day, and I am grateful for that.
472	Jonathan	United Kingdom	Belgium	E	E	close	40718	45028	E	im	male	"I have lived in six countries throughout my life, and speak three languages. Before I came here, I was looking for a place where I could be ambitious, creative and social. I thought Ghent is as good a place as any to start my life after university, and six years later, Im still here. I found my tribe here, in art school. I met open-hearted, open-minded, and interesting people. They showed me a culture in Belgium that suited me well. So I was able to make a genuine connection to the country and town I live in. People are definitely the key to that. Now I have put down my social roots here. It was very special for me to move to Belgium, because it was the first time that I felt my identity didnt rely so much on the past, my surroundings and other people. That new start was what I needed. I fell in love the first time here, had my first real job here and was able to explore my artistic ambitions. I definitely feel like an outsider, but Ive always felt that way, having moved around with my family since I was ten years old. To me that feeling is the norm. But now I embrace it. As a result, I feel Im less inclined to worry about being different, politically, or otherwise. I eat differently, think differently and am not afraid to be controversial. I dont feel I have a geographical home: I was born in Wales, but neither of my parents are from there. The longer Im away, the more I feel alienated by British culture. My accent has morphed over the years; British people cant even tell where Im from now. Im glad to contribute to the social diversity of Ghent. Diversity makes the world feel a bit bigger for all of us. Locals like practising their English on me. Also, professionally I am doing a job only an English native speaker can do, which is translating Dutch texts to English for museums, art galleries, artistic centres and individual artists here in Belgium and the Netherlands. Being a migrant is being me. Not being from here heightens my awareness of how much harder it is for other people. I think it makes you more sympathetic to other outsiders."
473	Jorge	México	United States	L	N	far	8326	63123	H	im	male	I first came to the US with my parents and two siblings when I was a child. After a while, we went back. I grew up between both cultures, but I always knew I didnt want to live in Mexico. I went to law school. I wanted to change the world and help people, but in Mexico there was an awful culture of corruption. So if and how the laws are being applied to you depends on how much money you have. I have lived in the United States continuously now for ten years. I still want to work towards the betterment of society and I'm working in politics. When I worked as an advisor for a Senator, I felt that my very existence there, in the Senate, with an employee badge, the fact that I worked there, and not in the kitchen, that made some people feel threatened. It is people who are afraid of change that are also afraid of immigrants. My job also allowed me to work with other immigrants, they all contribute more than society is aware of. When immigrants feel welcomed, they thrive, they will build a life, start businesses, open restaurants and add to the local culture. I think there are more people in favor of migration than against. And the interesting thing is that even people against it will always make exceptions for immigrants they know. They value their immigrant neighbors and colleagues. I think personal interaction is key. When we interact personally, we find out what we have in common: For many people they are things like love of their families, religion or the same football team. As an immigrant you touch people and you open up their minds. My advice to people in general is: Look around you, if everyone in your group of friends looks like you and has the same background, then go out there and change something! Bring other people into your life, they will enrich it. I find it astonishing, how easy it is to capitalize on people's fears. Even decent people, who care about those around them can be influenced that way. To those people I say: Culture grows like knowledge, and your experiences will grow, even your own sense of belonging will grow. Unless you are Native American, you are an immigrant to the United States. Unless you are the decedents of slaves, you or your family made a decision to pack up and come here, to build a new home. This country is built on immigration and we celebrate that. Thanksgiving is about a group of people starving and the locals sharing their food with them. I have been lucky. I had the chance to get a good education, and then was at the right place at the right time. But I know that there are people just as talented as me, or maybe more, who just need that chance and I feel it is my duty to help them so they can fulfil their potential for the betterment of our country.
474	Jory	Syrian Arab Republic	Iraq	M	M	close	890	4146	E	im	male	"My name is Jory al Hamed and I am Syrian. I started studied computer engineering at the University of Damascus, but in 2013 I had to flee my country before finalizing my degree because of the insecurity and the political situation. It was my first time outside of Syria, and Iraq is the first and only country I have traveled to. I moved to Qustabah camp in Erbil; leaving home is the most difficult thing I have ever done. I grew up in Damascus, the best place to be and the city I love the most. I miss everything about it; my friends and my memories are there, and it is difficult to be a refugee. But I overcome these feelings by continuously improving my skills and holding on to hope for the future. I still hope that I can have a better life and finish my studies, and I dream that I can one day own a software company. When the team from Re:Coded [a humanitarian startup that trains conflict-afflicted youth to become tech leaders] came to our camp and announced that they would start a programme to teach coding and web development, I was very excited and immediately decided to join. It proved to be a good experience because I developed my programming skills, which were still lacking, and I am proud that I can now build web applications. Discovering coding was an amazing experience. Re:Coded has not only given me computer skills, though: I have also made many new friends, from Iraq and abroad. I would like to help people learn more about coding, it is a fascinating science. I have worked with IOM and Re:Coded under a joint initiative to teach children at Qustabah camp how to develop video games. It was totally new idea for the kids, I taught them the basics of scratch programming language to crate interactive stories and animate them. They were very happy. For me, home now is where I can have freedom and where I can have a better life. I now know that we learn from all experiences, whether good or bad, and wish everyone peace and a good life."
475	Jose	Mauritius	France	A	E	far	8587	38959	E	im	male	I'm originally from Mauritius, but I live in France now. I work in neighbouring Geneva as an international civil servant for the United Nations. Migration for me meant movement from one country to another for economical reasons, but for others it can be politically motivated, or for family, cultural and a whole host of other reasons! Now that I am on the other side of my migration journey, it is important to help others. First, with some advice to potential newcomers: learn the customs and language, go to a social club, participate in and learn the politics of the new country, go out and mingle! But in more practical terms, I have offered a place to sleep and meals to compatriots of mine who have migrated here. Others in society can play a part by offering free language courses. I think local councils should host compulsory customs classes for new migrants. Furthermore, the government should put emphasis on jobs or training where migrants can interact with locals. All of this can help new arrivals mingle and feel comfortable with the people and customs of their host country — to me, that's what integration is all about.
476	José	Portugal	Belgium	E	E	close	22413	45028	E	im	male	I live in Brussels now, away from my natural home, Portugal, so I am a migrant. But my father was a diplomat and we travelled a lot around the world, so I know what it is to be out of your comfort zone. In a way I was lucky, a luxurious migrant because I didnt feel that I was left out of anything and I wasnt fleeing war or conflict – some of the things that migrants are facing today, and issues that are at the top of the political agenda. Home is where you feel welcome and accepted. There was once a philosopher who said he was an inhabitant of the world, and I think we should all feel that way. Moving around was not always easy – its rare, but sometimes you can come across ignorant people that make you feel uneasy because youre not a local. Its not fair, and of course its not the right attitude, but you have to try to overcome that. If you can, you have to call those people to the side and explain that its not easy to be away from home. They might one day come to your country, and if you know that they would be treated well when the roles are reversed, you can help them understand your point of view. Racism stems from stupidity and ignorance, and some of that blame actually falls on the politicians. We should try to educate our constituents and countrymen to the realities of the world. No matter where you come from, you can integrate a new society, if the other side will allow you to.
477	José Bustillo	Honduras	United States	L	N	far	2406	63123	H	im	male	At the age of 19, my father, who lived in Los Angeles, started the procedure for my residency papers. I lived with my mother and sister in San Francisco de Becerra, a small municipality in the department of Olancho (Honduras). The only idea I had about the United States was the one we built through television: big buildings, work and money. But when I arrived, I realized that the reality was different. At first, everything was confusing and difficult. I woke up crying because I missed everyone. I started working at McDonald's washing the dishes. Four months after my arrival, I moved to New Jersey, where I started living with my aunt. I had several jobs: in a factory, packing boxes, at the Hilton, cleaning the bathrooms and making beds. Almost half of the money earned was sent to Honduras. And all this time, I had trouble learning English and being able to enter university. Some people have told me that I should continue to work because studies are very expensive in the United States, an impossible dream. But when I have a goal, I do not stop until I get there. I first studied at a community college (as a kind of educational bridge), then I got a scholarship to enroll in communication and economics at Saint Pierre University. At first it was complicated, my English was not so good. I sat in the back because I was afraid they would ask me questions and I would not know how to answer them. I studied from 8:00 to 14:00, I worked in a restaurant and in the evening I did my homework. I made American, Italian and Latino friends. Between us, we spoke English, which allowed me to improve very quickly. And with effort, I managed to finish my studies in two years. Five years after my arrival, I became an American citizen hoping to bring my family with me. I think my future is here, but I have ideas about opening businesses in Honduras and continue to contribute to the development of my community. I organized a Facebook group of 200 people and managed to raise nearly $ 3,000 that we allocated to the original community clinic to provide better health care for my people. We are now 1,500 people involved in this project, For a Better Becerra.   With the current president, everything has changed. Some members of my family have been here for over two decades, they have American children. There is a lot of uncertainty about the revocation of the GST (Temporary Protected Status). I'm really sorry because most of the people who come here are working and trying so hard that they deserve an opportunity. For people considering migrating, I would tell them to choose the right path. The United States can be a place of opportunity, but also very hostile. I decided to follow the right path and it opened many doors for me. Many people, without knowing it, use me as an example for their children. It is a responsibility to continue to work and study. This country has been good for me, I met people who helped me a lot, but above all I was able to advance what made me grow. I started working at McDonald's and now I work as a financial analyst with a globally recognized company. My dream would be for my mother to come here and enjoy my accomplishements. It is thanks to her that I am where I am. With regard to Honduras, I wish peace and tranquility for my people. I come back every year and every time I'm there, I feel reborn. The love and hugs of my people encourage me.
478	Joseph	Australia	Germany	O	E	far	55823	45909	E	im	male	I am from a town near Brisbane in Australia. I came to Berlin for holidays in 2012 for 2 days. I fell in love with the city and ended up staying for two and half weeks. As soon as I left, I wanted to come back straight away. It is such a mixture of cultures - the attitudes are very open, it is a great city and it has pretty much everything you could want. There is music and art and it has something to offer to everybody. I returned to Berlin to study and now I am doing my PhD in wind energy. Being detached from the family is not great, but it is a necessary consequence. Parents never like to see their children wander far from the nest, but at the same time they want our happiness and the best for us. The thing I miss are warm personalities. As you get further north in Europe, the personalities are not as warm as they are at home. I think it must have something to do with the weather. In Germany you need to invest little time with people before they open up to you. Getting used to a culture takes a while and is a process of give and take. You have to try to engage actively by learning the language, going out and speaking with people.
479	Joseph Castillo	Peru	Argentina	L	L	close	6163	8476	E	im	male	"My name is Joseph Castillo, I am 21 years old and I live in Argentina. I study image and sound design at the University of Buenos Aires, a beautiful career that I couldn't find in Peru. This, the desire to have higher education and overcome myself, were the reasons why I decided to migrate. Coming to Argentina was a very difficult process because I am very attached to my family. The last day I was with them I began to cry over the idea that I would not see them as often as before. It is a great step that one takes, deciding to migrate. Although I always had the support of my loved ones, being alone is quite different; It is a strong change. I miss many things about Peru. The customs, for example. In Argentina I had to get used to their culture and everyday life. But what I miss most is Peruvian food. I will always want a pollo a la brasa (Peruvian grilled chicken) or a delicious ceviche (Peruvian seafood), but here it is difficult to find such Peruvian dishes. Peru has the best food in the world! In the future I see myself graduating and traveling to other countries. I want to learn more about cinematography, to work on more productions, and to take many photographs with different themes."
480	Joshi	Nicaragua	El Salvador	L	L	close	1905	3799	E	im	female	I migrated with my family once my mother remarried a Salvadoran man. We started a new life away from violence and thats why we came to El Salvador. Even though this is a Central American country, and in the same geographic area, there are a lot of cultural changes, even the food is different. It wasnt my decision to migrate. I was a minor and I had to be with my mother. I had to be at school and that was the most complicated process. But even though we didnt have all the documents, there were people who were nice and helped us to get into school. When we were at school, my sister and I attracted a lot of attention because we were from another country. At recess, the children used to surround us and ask us where we were from, what were our names, what do you do back home, and thats a very peculiar Salvadoran trademark: they can be very friendly… nearly to the extreme. That helped my adaptation. Despite this, xenophobia can be easily disguised. It might just be as a joke, but its still xenophobic. Theyve asked me why I sing the national anthem with such love if Im not from here. But I feel Salvadoran just like anyone else.  My nationality should not get in the way of me committing and contributing to the improvement of this country. I havent lost my identity as a Nicaraguan woman, but I also claim my Salvadoran identity, as a migrant. Thats when you realize: I found my place in the world. My family in Nicaragua was very large. I missed my cousins and my grandparents, and its hard because when I came here I was 14. I had to adapt and it was a slow process… Now, I know that I havent lost my family, I just travelled a bit far from them, but I gained a new one. Im an activist because I want a better reality for the country where I am living, and where I want to remain. Were not guilty of wanting a better future for us, its our right… To other young women migrants I would say that you are not illegal, you have rights and you have the right to stay where you are, regardless of why you migrated. You have to persevere and never feel guilty for migrating. There is always hope and always something to rescue.
481	Joshua	Sierra Leone	Morocco	A	A	close	475	3108	H	im	male	Since he couldnt find a stable job back home, Joshua, 24, decided to drop out of his Sociology studies in Sierra Leone and go to Europe where he was hoping to build a better future for himself and his wife, Jennifer. It was discouraging to see so many of my friends graduating from university and not being able to feed their families with their diplomas. A lot of young people at home invest so much in their studies and careers, but truth is, none of their dreams will come true if they dont know the right people. Its all about who you know, Joshua says. A year ago, Joshua packed the little he had and headed for Morocco. His wife Jennifer, aged 20, soon joined him in Morocco, hoping to make the rest of the trip together. From there, they tried crossing into Spain several times, but in vain — they were returned to shore each time. Seeing Jennifer was pregnant, the couple decided to head back home through Algeria. However, they struggled to find enough money to continue the trip, and Jennifer was developing complications related to her pregnancy. I begged people to help her as she was crying and in pain. They wouldnt even sell me medicine at the pharmacy, he recounts. The two boarded a truck along with other West African migrants and traveled to Niger. There were injured people and pregnant women on the truck, but no one cared. The truck was speeding through the desert, he tells. By the time they arrived at point zero at Algerias border with Niger, Jennifer was already 9 months pregnant. By the time she reached Assamaka, she was in need of immediate medical assistance. A solution had to be found for the family as quickly as possible. IOMs two community mobilizers (MobComs) who are deployed to Assamaka offered Jennifer one of their rooms until her condition stabilized. Initially, it looked like a regular pregnancy without any symptom of emergency. She soon started having contractions, but the baby didnt seem ready to come out, recalls Natsuko Sawaya, Public Health Officer with IOMs mission in Niger. Jennifer and her husband ended up staying in Assamaka for the following eight days until it was deemed safe enough for her to endure the 5-hour ambulance ride to Arlit. IOM works closely with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and local authorities in the commune of Ingall to provide immediate medical assistance for migrants in distress. Natsuko was on the phone each day with the family to check on Jennifer, while the MSF team operating at the health center in Assamaka and the IOM nurse were ready to assist with an eventual delivery. Once Jennifers condition improved over the course of the next few days, the family was transported to Arlit where a doctor from the local hospital performed an emergency C-section. Its been quite the experience for the people involved, but we are grateful for the positive turnout, Natsuko says. An average of two babies per month are born in IOMs transit centers in Niger. Over 37,000 medical consultations have been performed at IOMs six transit centers in Niger so far this year, with an average of 17 urgent medical cases per week. Assamaka will soon be equipped with a brand new health center with a maternity ward. Until then, such cases can be challenging, Natsuko says. Migrants often arrive without any medical documents which makes it hard to assess the situation. Without adequate equipment and proper gynecologists or midwives on site, it can be a struggle to determine the best course of action. Three days after the delivery, Jennifer and Jane joined Joshua at IOMs transit center in Arlit as they waited for the birth certificate and Janes vaccinations to be completed. It was quite stressful because I couldnt manage to get any tests done during the pregnancy, so we werent sure if the baby was healthy. Every time I was worried, I would pick up the phone and call Natsuko and she would reassure me, Jennifer says. This is my first baby, but we hope to have one more. From there, the family traveled to Agadez, and then onwards to Niamey, from where they boarded the plane for Freetown. This year alone, more than 12,000 migrants participated in the Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) programme from Niger to their country of origin — 476 from Sierra Leone. I have seen terrible things during this journey, but I cant dwell on things too much otherwise it will destroy me. I am trying to put everything behind me, Joshua says. The most important thing is that our baby is healthy. She is strong, just like her mother. Two ambulances were provided by IOM for the health centres in Assamaka and Séguédine through the Immigration and Border Management (IBM) project Strengthening Health Capacities at the Borders with Assamaka and Séguédine. The project is implemented thanks to the Migration Resource Allocation Committee (MIRAC). IOMs Search and Rescue (SAR) and Humanitarian Rescue operations are conducted jointly with the General Directorate for Civil Protection (DGPC) in Niger and are funded through the support of the Government of the Netherlands, the United Kingdoms Department for International Development (DFID) and the European Union, within the framework of the Migrant Resource and Response Mechanism. Nearly 25,000 people have been assisted through these operations since April 2016.
482	Judicaël	Benin	Morocco	A	A	close	1254	3108	E	im	male	I was born in Benin, where I lived until I was 19 years old. After I finished high school, I started studying chemistry at the University for a year until I obtained a scholarship through the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI) and moved to Morocco to continue my studies in biology and pharmacology. I left behind all my family, my childhood friends and the land I had cherished so much since I was born. I didnt want to leave my peaceful life in Benin but my fathers words were final: a man must go on an adventure if necessary. Go study there!. So off I went to an unknown country, whose language I couldnt speak and whose culture I knew nothing about. When I arrived in Morocco I was scared and uncertain about what to expect at first. But thankfully I was generously welcomed and guided by elder fellows from Benin who live here. After my graduation, I was offered a great position at Caritas Morocco and decided to stay to gain professional experience before going back to my country to serve my people. I worked as the coordinator of health services for four years and was helping a very vulnerable migrant population. Serving them made me aware of how vulnerable they are. The most important for me is to defend their rights and help them rise, no matter where. Through my contribution and migration-related work, I feel useful and can serve my peers – other migrants like me. I like saying that what defines us is not so much what we are, but what we do.
483	Judith	United States	Rwanda	N	A	far	63123	798	L	im	female	"I grew up in Florida. I worked for about four years with refugees in the United States, teaching art to kids and teenagers that were permanently resettled to the US. After finalizing my undergraduate education, I moved to northern Uganda and managed to go from working for an organization, to developing my own independent projects. I moved between New York for graduate school, South Sudan and then to the Dominican Republic and Haiti for field research projects. All this time I was working on topics that related to migration, a subject I am very interested in, and the way art can be used to share human stories and connect individuals. When I finished my studies, I found a job that brought me to West Africa; I lived and worked in Sierra Leone for a few years, before coming to Rwanda in 2013. In Kigali I immediately found it difficult to hear peoples true opinions and learn their stories, which was very different than my experiences in other parts of the continent. It seemed like all Rwandans were very private. After some time in Kigali, I was fortunate to meet some artists whose work focused on personal expression, but I realized that none of the work I was seeing in galleries was really being accessed by the people living in their city. Through conversations and sharing personal interests, we began to see an opportunity to use art as a tool for community engagement and expression around critical social issues. I started working with Rwandan artists, and partnering with a range of government and private stakeholders to create new projects that took art out of the gallery and into the streets, to address social topics. Creating public artwork that focuses on social issues was conceptually new in Kigali, and being a foreigner trying to introduce a new idea can have both its advantages and challenges. The skills I had developed though my varied global experiences were a value-add, but there is always the risk of something appearing as overly foreign, brought in by outsiders, and thus not being accepted or appreciated. We prioritize working with community members to identify subject matter and the physical location for our art works, and by doing so, we create art with and for the people who will have daily access and engagement with the resulting pieces of art. It is so important to identify issues of importance to the communities where the work will live, so we try to work hand in hand with community collaborators and a range of other influential Rwandans, to help ensure the work is well received and not viewed as a threat to local culture or values. I believe, as someone once said, culture is not only about the past but also about the present and the future. So Im trying to bring something new while recognizing and celebrating what already exists and has value. For now, Ive made Rwanda my home, but I think home is a transitory thing, and homes change; different elements make a place become a home, and as these elements change, the way you feel in that place changes as well. My personal experience working, living, and being friends with people who have come from one place or have moved to another place, has been very rich and rewarding; these people have a the widest perspective about the world. People's experiences make them dynamic, and the more experiences you can accumulate in your life the better, so for me, connecting with people coming from other places is an opportunity to learn and grow. I believe that at the end of the day, migrants make the world go around, and Im lucky to be able to go around it too."
484	Jules	Democratic Republic of the Congo	Democratic Republic of the Congo	A	A	close	506	506	E	hc	male	My name is Jules. Im a member of the Congolese diaspora. I lived in Europe, specifically Belgium and France, and came back to respond to the call of the DRC government who wanted to engage Congolese living abroad who had a certain expertise. I specialize in environment, water, forestry, and management of development. I have had the opportunity to travel a lot. Some neighboring countries in the Congo Basin, such as the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon requested our expertise, so I was traveling as part of projects. Here we are working together in an association called COSADEF. This association is accepted in the Congo Basin and recognized by some embassies. When I came back, I said that we cannot be all government officials. We prefer to be independent consultants, and the Congolese government agreed. The government consults us on some issues in the management of development. Today we are partners of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a diaspora reintegration program. We opened a printing shop with own funds. We were told that integration is not automatic and that we had to fight. That's why we bought the equipment. We have a newspaper made by our experts. This allows us to earn our living.  We fight, we cope, and we earn a steady daily income. Migration is a great school. Each country has a potentiality. Everyone has something that another one does not, so when we travel we learn. I became who I am today because I traveled a lot. I learned to live with people who are not like me. I gained a lot and I learned to fight in life. We visited a lot of countries that do not have many natural resources such as the DRC but progress anyway. Expertise has no nationality. We are resourceful. We came back and we manage to succeed.
485	Julia	Brazil	Portugal	L	E	far	6797	22413	E	im	female	"I felt the need to leave Brazil as soon as I finished my undergraduate studies. In Portugal my academic experience became much richer because I was out of my comfort zone. I began my masters degree last year, and now I am doing an internship in communication while also working in a kiosk to meet my expenses. I think my choice to come to Portugal was influenced by two of my great friends who happen to be Portuguese. I only knew Lisbon from what I used to hear in history classes at school. We did not listen to Portuguese music or watch Portuguese TV shows. My vision of Portugal was based on the old Portugal. When I arrived I was very surprised. Lisbon was such an open city with people from all over the world and places that I did not expect to see here, such as the LX Factory for instance. I expected to see places like this in Berlin, but not in Lisbon. There is a really good mix of cultures. I found a Brazilian Lisbon and an African Lisbon that I did not even imagine existed. I came without knowing what to expect and believing that even if it did not work out it would still be a good experience. I had an open mind and I was ready to accept opportunities as they came. During my first week at university, I struggled to understand what teachers were saying. It was a shock to me. I had a teacher in Branding Management who used to joke a lot during the classes. People would laugh and I remember laughing too without having a clue what the joke was. I think it is because of the languages music/sound in Portugal compared to Brazil. As time went by I got used to the differences. If I had to leave Lisbon, I would miss its beautiful viewpoints and its simple way of life. I like the simplicity and the way people value the small things of life, such as sitting at a viewpoint with a glass of wine and you're good for the night! Those who did not experience living in a violent context do not value safety enough. I feel like a migrant because I was confronted with all the difficulties that a foreigner meets here. In addition to the difficulty of finding a job, I had to go through all the necessary and complicated bureaucratic process to legalize my stay here. It is difficult to replace the feeling of being at home. I love Lisbon, but it will never be the place in which I was born. It is a different feeling, not better, nor worse; itis just a part of the experience of migration. Those who take the initiative to leave home are open and receptive to a new culture and new ways of living. In general, young people are more able to welcome foreigners. There is a lady in Alfama who usually sits on one set of stairs close to my house. For me, to be able to speak with her is the best. She may not know this but I always try to make the conversation as long as possible to absorb and experience the culture and people who surround me."
486	Julia	Ukraine	Estonia	E	E	close	3557	23106	H	im	female	I was born in Ukraine. I have first visited Estonia a couple of times last year while I was an exchange student in Finland. I moved to Estonia almost two months ago because I found a job here. For now Im an Intern but I will start working full time soon. I cannot say that I love my life in Estonia but I dont hate it either, I just dont feel at home here. I know that I moved to Estonia very recently, so it is normal to be facing some difficulties. Also I dont know many people here and I dont know the language. Thankfully a lot of people speak English or Russian, so I can manage to talk with them. Estonians are very much like Finns. They are very straightforward, honest and quiet. I wouldnt say that Estonia is totally different from Ukraine. Well, of course, the government system is completely different, the health care is different, but you dont notice that in everyday life. The streets, the city and the people are quite similar to Ukraine. The city is full of old Soviet Union architecture, you can find that quite a lot in Ukraine also, and you hear a lot of Russian language, so sometimes it feels like I never left Ukraine. I think migration positively influences a person, but that depends on how the person views the migration process and what triggered it. I think it introduces people to a lot of new things like culture, people, new governmental system, new health care system, and new ways of living. When you move you have to reinvent how you live, and at some points in life that might be useful. I would like to stay in Estonia for a few years, but I miss Finland. Estonia is a good country for me right now but maybe that will change soon.
487	Juliana	Philippines	Philippines	I	I	close	3299	3299	E	hc	female	My name is Juliana and I am from the Philippines. I left my country when I was 45 years old, looking for a better job and a higher income. Back home I worked in a pharmacy laboratory for 5 years, and in a clothes factory for 3 years. I came to Greece hoping to get a job and make a good living. It took me many months to finally get a job as a housekeeper, but I lived in Greece for 17 years from 2001. However, when Greece went through the economic crisis, finding or maintaining a job was really hard. At the same time, I faced many difficulties because of my fragile health, which made me think about returning to my hometown of Marikina. I was already aware of IOMs AVRR programme so I visited the IOM office in Athens to get more information on my options. IOM informed me that I could benefit from Reintegration Assistance thus, I made the decision to return. As I am getting older I prefer to be with my people in my hometown. One month after my arrival in my country with IOM's help, I set up my own Sari Sari, a grocery store in the Philippines. Moreover, six months after my business was set up, IOM Greece visited me in Marikina City to evaluate my business. It is running well and my income is enough to support myself and my family. IOM gave me the opportunity not only to return to my hometown, but also to restart my life here, where I feel more useful and more participative in my community.
488	Julie	United Kingdom	Belgium	E	E	close	40718	45028	E	im	female	None of us have to go back very far in our own family histories to find some connection to migration. My ancestors were among the first wave of Huguenot refugees from France in the late 1600s, fleeing religious persecution. They settled in the Midlands and brought the lace trade with them, which led to economic prosperity for that region. The word refugee came into the English language around that time. Its a story about how migrants and refugees come with skills and the desire to make something in the place where they settle. I have spent my whole adult life working with marginalised communities in some way or other. In North West of England constituency, these areas have been settled by many migrant populations from all over the world. Many of the communities have faced a lot of discrimination and racism for decades. Ever since we had the Brexit referendum vote in 2016, our migrant communities have been experiencing a terrible increase in racism and hatred: online, offline, in the street and in the media. Many of these communities dont know if they want to stay in the UK now and they dont feel welcome anymore. The media is playing a big part in whipping up racist sentiment and xenophobia in British society, they are allowing a populist ideology to take hold.  Its important now to bring communities together. The arts and culture are great tools for doing so, because it enables people to share things that they care about and find parallels between communities rather than differences. I witness this openness in my constituency. Within the EU, we have to make sure that our policies allow for inclusion when it comes to education, employment and support for entrepreneurship. We have to recognize that people coming to our societies are bringing their aspirations and skills with them, and we have to show that we have societies that will be welcoming.
489	Julio	Ecuador	United States	L	N	far	5600	63123	H	im	male	Julio arrived in New York from Ecuador in 1994. Since then, not only has he built a new life for himself and started a family, but he also competes against top runners in the world. Today he is one of the fastest non-professional runners to participate in worlds biggest footrace – the New York marathon. I am thankful to this country because it has given me the opportunity to work, to run and to meet my wife. I thank God I met a woman like her because she always supports me. When Julio arrived, he was inspired by New York marathon winner - the Mexican runner Germán Silva. It made an impression on me and I thought, I have to run that race one day, I dont know how but I have to one day! Since then, Julio has been training to pursue his dream, no matter how hard it is for him to combine training with his job as a prep-chef in a busy Manhattan restaurant. The job is tough but we all work together and try to help each other. Fridays and Saturdays the restaurant closes late and its harder for me since I have to wake up early to train. Even though his life is now in New York, Julio still misses Ecuador. I was born in Ecuador, in the countryside. I miss those days. But, over there, it was impossible to have desires or dreams and the problem was work. I miss my parents more than anything. I dont know if I will see them again, but I know that I can help them from here.  I would like to go back to Ecuador, but my son has dreams here in New York, and going back would be like clipping his wings. I can go back, but the problem is I cannot return. My son, he has big dreams and I always support him When I came here, I felt alone in this country. In many parts there is separation but then in other parts you build a new family. And my life is made here. In 2014, Julio participated in the New York marathon, placing 123rd out of 50,530 runners and finishing in under 2 hours and 40 minutes. He also achieved his dream of being the fastest in his age group. When one is well prepared, the body responds like a force you didnt know you had. My family was waiting for me at the finish line and thinking about them gave me the strength to finish.
490	Junior	Guinea	Niger	A	A	close	1179	568	E	im	male	"My brother came back to Guinea after spending one year in Italy, and bought himself a branded car. I wanted the life he had. I got a passport and applied for a visa, but things didn't work out as planned so I had to find another way to get to Europe. When I left home, I had no idea what the route ahead of me would be like. Once in Bamako, I had to ask the smugglers what the way to Europe was, and they explained all the tips and tricks of irregular migration to me. Between Mali and Algeria, I was kidnapped and asked for money. The smugglers searched my bag, found my university diploma and my passport, and tore them apart in front of my eyes. They locked me and my fellow travellers up for two weeks with no food. If your parents refused to send money, they would beat you up. After they released us, we continued our journey. We walked for three days straight without food or water, with no houses or villages in sight. Five people died, including a friend of mine. He couldnt walk anymore so I put him on my shoulder and walked some more. At some point, I stopped, I cried and left him there. I told the group I was with that we needed to follow the antennas and find the main road. Cars would stop from time to time and give us some water or pieces of bread. One man told us to get in his car, and that he would drop us off in the nearest village. On the way, we realized he was actually taking us to Tamanrasset to sell us. Once there, different smugglers asked for 10,000 francs each in exchange for our freedom. Half of the group managed to pay and was released; the other half stayed behind. I told the people I was with it that I was determined to make it to Italy, that it was a matter of life or death. They decided to follow me. We managed to get to Libya by bus and spent two weeks in Tripoli waiting to get on the boat to Italy. It was 4am on the day the smugglers loaded 300 people onto the boat. One of the passengers was designated as captain and taught how to navigate in a matter of minutes. There were so many clouds when we left, the wind was blowing and people were shaking. Many fell into the water as we were boarding - the smugglers called it a sacrifice. Our boat capsized after 200 km and only half of the people survived. We were taken back to Tripoli and put in prison, and from there they moved us to a prison in Algeria. One day when the guards were serving food, I managed to escape. I started running, but I didnt know where I was going. I was asking people for directions left and right, but no one spoke French. I finally found a young Arab girl who spoke French and frantically asked her the way back to Niger. She told me she would show me where to find my African brothers and hopped into a taxi with me. On the way there, I told her about everything I had been through as she listened carefully, and when I finished she started crying. When we got to the ghetto, a big group was getting ready to leave for Tripoli. I started laughing when a 14-year-old Guinean boy told me he was going there. He said: Its a matter of life or death and that 40 of their friends had succeeded in arriving in Italy the previous day. He asked me why I was laughing. I told him he would find out in a couple of months. I then told them everything I knew about the route and all the suffering I had been through. Some listened and changed their minds about leaving, others went ahead with their plan. The girl was still there waiting for me when I finished. Once my father sent me some money, I wanted to pay her back, but she refused. She took me to a place where I could spend the night and came back to see me later that afternoon with juice and snacks. We talked about the future and irregular migration, about family and my reasons for leaving. She was surprised to hear I had a good university degree, but I had still decided to attempt this journey. People get encouraged by others on social media, but Facebook doesnt show you the whole truth."
491	Junyu	China	Ireland	I	E	far	10229	86251	H	im	male	I came here to study English as a student. I wanted to study and improve my English, then maybe choose a course and get some qualifications to go back to China with and get a decent job with better provisions. In China, if you can speak English its much better for your future. I came here in 2000 and it was relatively easy for me to find a job. The job itself was hard for me because I didnt speak any English at all. I could say hello, how are you?, what is your name and that was it. It was very, very basic. But I found a job in a fast food restaurant. It was a cleaning job, and I could do it even though I had no English and couldnt communicate. I could then support myself. A few years later I met a man in a trade union who helped me after I was unfairly sacked from a job in a security company. My life changed when I met him. He mentioned that a lot of Chinese people who didnt speak English very well had been coming to him looking for help and support. In 2005, I offered to volunteer helping the Chinese community as by then I could speak both English and Chinese. I applied for a job with an organization that I had built a relationship with while working in the Trade Union and I got the job. Visas are the biggest issue for non-EU migrants in Ireland. My wife and I had been offered new jobs but because we were having difficulty getting our visas renewed we thought we would have to go back to China. We were not willing to become undocumented. I told my new boss our issue and he said If we can help you get it would you like to stay in Ireland and continue working for us? I told him if he could solve the visa issue, we would of course stay but if not, we would go back to China. It took a while, but my family and I obtained working visas. I have set up my family here, my wife is here, my child is here and hes Irish actually, being born here. It would be a big change for us to move back to China now.
492	Jürgen	Germany	Germany	E	E	close	45909	45909	E	hc	male	It makes absolutely no sense to talk about foreigners and their status, because I am a foreigner in every country but Germany. I am not entitled to judge or to change a culture or culturally influenced behavior. I was always welcomed in Kuwait, Brazil, India and all the other countries when I approached people in a friendly way. In order to feel at home and integrated in foreign countries, I did sports with the people there. That was a unifying element besides work. When that was possible, I felt at home very quickly. Of course, some people said: 'You Germans are really great, you're so efficient, you make the best products – but you don't enjoy life'. There is some truth in that. Our high performance is time-consuming and it looks, as we do not enjoy life. But we Germans also do enjoy this perfection a little bit. Even though it's not always a laughing matter. I thought about that comment and talked about it with the guy. That's when the dialog started. And when there is a dialog, it's a step in the right direction. The worst case is when there is no more dialog. Regarding the newly arriving migrants, the most important thing is that they are not only here, but that they are integrated. I think it's very enriching that these people are here. Many are also highly trained, have already accomplished something in their countries of origin and are ready to achieve something here. You have to use every opportunity to give them a job so that they can provide for themselves with dignity. That's the most important task in my opinion. I don't understand why politicians don't work harder to incorporate the migrants into the work process as quickly and pragmatically as possible. In that case, a lot would heal on its own. When they sit in camps and don't know what will become of them, they get nervous. That's completely normal.

My husband works in a Maruti factory nearby. We live in one room with our two small children. Here, the problem is we have to pay for everything like electricity, water, rent, ration, and we need to adjust accordingly. We came here because in the village women cannot work in the fields, while here both men and women can work in companies. Also, in the village there are only fields to work on and no other resources to take care of the household expenses. Here one can get employed and earn enough to take care of children and other household duties; children can get good education, one can save more; The difference between the village and here is that women there have to stay at home. For example, we are meeting you and talking to you here, we cant do that in the village. We cannot go outside; we can only go out when there is a wedding or a party. Here if the husband isnt there sometimes we can go to the doctor on our own, or anywhere else for that matter. Overall life is better here."

Originally my family came from China but my parents immigrated to North Viet Nam a long time ago.  In 1954, they moved to the South where I was born and brought up. So I can say that I am originally from Viet Nam, a country that I escaped by boat in 1979 with 294 other Vietnamese. I left because life was hard to live for many reasons at the time.  I still miss the village where I spent my childhood, and the people – most of my friends still live there. Due to the moving about, it has not always been easy for me to define what and who I am in terms of nationality.  When I was living in Viet Nam and going back to visit it, the Vietnamese regard me as Chinese.  When I travel in China, the Chinese think of me as Vietnamese.  Now having lived in the UK for much of my life, I have decided to be. Chinese-Vietnamese-Irish –British! My family has moved countries a few times. I myself have moved twice. Both times I have received nothing but kindness, warm welcome and friendship.  The move to Northern Ireland was an interesting one as it was in some way similar to Viet Nam during the war! The communities were however extremely hospitable. I have never forgotten the generous help and support friends gave me when I settled there and this has had an influence on my life, still today.  I still keep in touch with the friends and go back to see them every so often after nearly 40 years! I am pleased that I made the moves; without these I would not have fully realized my potential and achieved a fulfilling life."

He was smuggled in a small boat overcrowded with migrants to Greece. At one point the boat turned over and all of them were suddenly in the cold water. This was a terrible experience for Kamal but he managed to survive and reach the coast. After spending almost one month in Greece he was smuggled to Macedonia and from there he went to Serbia and finally Croatia.

496	Kamolnan	Thailand	United States	I	N	far	7189	63123	H	im	female	When I was 18, I moved from Bangkok to New York in order to pursue my studies. I remember first arriving in the city and seeing a wealth of lights emanating from the buildings. It was beautiful, yet I felt a rush of loneliness as I was about to settle in a place without my family and friends. Being so far away from home, it was difficult to feel connected to my roots. Even if I am halfway around the world, it is very important for me to preserve aspects of my Thai culture. I have stuck to the values and morals I was raised with: to be open-hearted to meeting new people, open-minded when learning about their cultures and to put family and loved ones first. There is a saying, home is where the heart is. To me, home is wherever the people I hold dear to my heart are. But unfortunately, this is not a comfort that everyone is afforded. There are millions of stateless people out there who are not given the right to a place they can call home. I was born and raised in a country which evolved rapidly. Bangkok is a bustling, modernised city, but the moment you step outside of the city, it is akin to walking into another world. There are millions of people living in poverty and squalor- people who have no voice. That's why I founded Voices Organisation with the mission to uplift the lives of abused women and children, especially those who are stateless. My obligations and loyalties lie with my family, my country, and to the world. My mission in life is to make those around me proud of who they are, and know that they are not alone. I want to live in a world where women and children are accepted for who they are, and not marginalised because of where they were born. Even though we are from all walks of life, we can and should always lean on each other.

I love to visit India Gate. I always wanted to come to a big city and my parents did not want me to go too far from home so I chose Delhi. I actually really like Delhi and I live in the buildings where I work so my home keeps changing with my contracts. Moving to Delhi was strange though. It was scary and I was alone. I just came to Delhi one day without a plan and I didnt have a house or anyone I knew. I got in touch with some people from my village who were already working in Delhi and I found work through them. I dont have any family here, my family is back in the village, but I visit them every month. Two of my elder brothers have studied till 8th grade; I also have a younger brother who studied till 5th grade. I studied till 6th grade. I didnt study further because I had some personal problems at home. I dont get any help from the government, nothing. I do not follow the politics here in Delhi but I do follow politics of my village very closely as I have good knowledge of it. I make it a point to go to the village and vote. Voting there seems more relevant to me than voting in Delhi. I miss playing cricket with my friends the most. I have played it sometimes here too but its not the same. I also miss home the most but I call my mother whenever that happens. As for my plans for the future, I will go back to the village for at least 2 months and then Ill come to Delhi and find some other work like machinery. I dont want to do construction work anymore because I dont end up earning much. However, I will come back to Delhi because I really like it here. "
498	Karen	Armenia	Belarus	I	E	far	4266	6377	E	im	female	Before Karen and his family moved to Belarus, they lived in Ukraine as well as in Russia. However, they chose Belarus as their final destination country to live in, because his father was already working here. We chose Belarus because it is very peaceful, says Karen. Karen and his sister graduated from a school in a small town near Minsk. At school I had difficulties in learning Russian and, especially Belarusian. With the help and support of my teachers I quickly improved my Russian and Belarusian, recalls Karen. Weve always been treated well here. It is really great to know that Belarusian people know and remember their history. Im especially pleased to know that Belarusians remember the fact, that Ivan Bagramyan, a Soviet military commander, originally Armenian, played a crucial role in freeing Belarus during the Second World War. Karen graduated from Belarusian State Economy University, where now he works, giving lectures to students. Karen is also Co-chairman of the Armenian youth diaspora. When I participate in different international conferences and events, I always say that I represent two countries: Armenia and Belarus, because my motherland that gave me life is Armenia and Belarus is the place that raised me. Karen says that he is a Belarusian-Armenian. Most of all in Belarus, he likes friendliness, European attitude as well as cities and parks. Karen says that he has never had any conflicts caused by ethnical or cultural issues. However, Karen has some anecdotes linked to his non-Slavic appearance, when he was considered to be a Georgian or representative of Arabic countries. Even though moving to another country is commonly associated with stress, I can say that I only benefited from it. Now I can easily find a common language with new people and channel communication in a positive way.
499	Karen	China	Australia	I	O	far	10229	55823	H	im	female	I was born and raised in Beijing, and worked there for some time as an editor with a population and economics journal. My husband and I have two kids, one is six and the other is two years old. A year ago we moved to Goulburn, Australia for my husbands job in a windfarm nearby. I decided to resign from my job in Beijing and sign up for this adventure. I feel happy and lucky to be settled in Australia. Goulburn is a nice and peaceful town, people are happy to help each other and I enjoy making new friends. Moving was easier than I thought because we had the support of many people who also migrated to this town. I miss many things from China. I miss Beijing and its historical sites. Im excited to take my children back to visit the famous spots I grew up in and explain their heritage. They can be confused sometimes as to why they are different and about where they come from. But they enjoy the new friends and meeting new people. My life has changed so much since moving to Australia. Im impressed with the lifestyle of Goulburn and the quality time I get to spend with my family. In my country I used to work late nights and even weekends. Here I dont feel that I need a lot. Life became simpler and I can focus on my marriage, my children and myself. I feel very lucky. Im planning someday again to go back to my career in the news industry. I know it can be difficult to achieve this in a foreign country, but I am taking steps now for what may come in the future. Meanwhile I will continue to enjoy the time I have to spend with my family in Australia.
500	Karim	Iraq	Greece	M	E	far	4146	18117	E	im	male	My names Karim and I come from the Mosul area in northern Iraq. When ISIS invaded our land, as a Yezidi I had no choice but to flee. I arrived on the island of Samos, Greece in 2016. It hurts deep in my heart that I had to leave home, its hard for me to share or talk about what Ive been through, the horrible things that led to my decision to leave. No one abandons their homeland for nothing. My people are uprooted. I traveled with some members of my extended family. I had to carry my aunt, an elderly woman that could not walk all the way to the Aegean Sea. Before the war broke in our land, I was working as a carpenter, doing woodwork – kitchen cupboards and the like. I was happy and also, much more brawny than I am today. When I left Iraq, I weighed 95 kilos. Now, I barely weigh 75 kilos. When I arrived in Greece, I registered for the relocation program. Like so many others, Germany was my final destination and the day I found out that I was going there was a really happy one. I just want to have a normal life again, learn the language and get a job as a carpenter, or any other job for that matter. I want to be independent. Even if peace comes back to my homeland, I dont think Ill ever go back again. Its too painful. Even if things are back to normal, everything will remind me of the horrible things Ive seen and Ive been through. My life is in Europe now.
501	Karim and Yves	Cameroon	Spain	A	E	far	1502	27409	H	im	n	Karim and Yves trekked for years through Africa from Cameroon before arriving in Spain where they now play football and rugby, realising a life-long ambition even if their daily lives are still a struggle. They're not the only ones to have stepped onto Spanish shores with dreams of making it big in the sporting world. Associations and migrants say roughly a quarter of new arrivals' main reason for coming is to play professionally. But a large majority are soon brought back down to earth with a bang when faced with the long search for residency papers while eking out a living. Sense of belonging Karim Issa Abdou and Yves Kepse Tchonang are arguably among the lucky ones. While their lives are totally separate, they share many similarities. Both 27-years-old, they clambered over the barbed wire and razor-sharp blades of the triple barrier between Morocco and Spain's overseas territory of Melilla, one of only two land borders between Africa and the European Union. Karim now plays for Alma de Africa (Heart and Soul of Africa in English), a football team in southern Jerez de la Frontera composed almost exclusively of migrants in the second division of the regional league. Yves plays at front row at Rugby Club Valencia more than 700 kilometres (450 miles) away in eastern Spain, in the first division of the regional league. While they're not professional, which means they aren't paid for playing, both are surrounded by associations that can provide legal and housing support. Crucially, being part of a team has given meaning to otherwise difficult lives, they say. Alma de Africa has given me stability, says Karim, sipping a beer at a bar in Jerez, large headphones round his neck ready to play music like Cameroon's makossa or rap by France's Booba. A self-confessed brawler when the team was formed in 2015, he says he has since settled down. Robbed, injured Born in a nomadic family in Ngaoundere in northern Cameroon, Karim says he left when he was only around 10 years old with a friend. It took him some four years to go through Nigeria, Niger and Algeria before arriving in Morocco, where he lived another three years in the Gourougou Mountain that overlooks Melilla. Along the way, the Zinedine Zidane fan earned money to keep going, doing odd jobs, just like Yves, who cuts an imposing, brawny figure. One of seven siblings, Yves left home in the western city of Bafoussam in 2012 to play rugby. In Niger, he recalls many instances of employers refusing to pay him and threatening to call the police. Both recount being robbed of their possessions along the way, as do other Alma de Africa members. When you're a kid, there are people who take your phone, everything you have, the rucksack, the clothes, the money, and you have to start afresh, says Karim, a contagious laugh always at the ready despite difficult recollections.
502	Karla	El Salvador	México	L	L	close	3799	8326	E	im	female	I left El Salvador when I was 20 and I came to Mexico. I was doing a Bachelor in foreign languages, but I was in danger and I had financial problems. I was threatened by some criminals and I decided to leave. I started to look for a job, but I couldnt find one. My sister was working in a shoe shop in Hidalgo and she told me to come to work with her. I decided to start this journey and over the years I met my husband who is from Guatemala and who also came to Mexico to work. We started to get along with each other and we decided to live together. I have always been a good cook, as we were starting our marriage I was always preparing a different meal for him so one day we decided to open a restaurant of Salvadoran food. We started to put together some money and we opened our restaurant. At the beginning, our stove and everything was little, but we had the desire to work. In the first instance, it was very difficult because people didnt really know us and unfortunately we were discriminated against because of our nationality. I began with some food samples for them to test it before buying. They started to like our food and we started to increase our customers. They even started to ask for delivery. That is how we started to grow and now our business is running properly. We didnt have any employee, my husband was the waiter and I was the cook. Eventually, as our business grew, we were able to recruit some staff. Currently, three women from Central America are working with us (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala). Theyre also migrants who are looking for a better future. Being a migrant gave me the motivation and boosted me to start my own business. In El Salvador, I was afraid because I had bad experiences. Often, criminals asked us for money when they noticed that we were selling things. We dont have that kind of problems here and we can work in a safe environment. The good thing about being in a new country is that you can meet new people and you can start from zero. In my case, I was successful with my business and I managed to start my family. The bad thing is that sometimes some people discriminate against you but this must not be a reason for you to give up. You have to find the positive ways to move forward. I know other similar cases of migrants who started from scratch and they have managed to be successful during the course of time.
503	Kassem	Syrian Arab Republic	United States	M	N	far	890	63123	H	im	male	Kassem's pain is still too vivid. Each of his conversations revolve around the current conflict in Syria. He says he endured starvation and even survived a sarin gas attack. I love Syria a lot and that's why I have dedicated my life to see Syria become a better country. I joined the revolution in 2011 and I tried my best to help in any way possible. Even when I came here my main concern was to help Syria and try to get more support to help the Syrian people, he says. For the past two years, Kassem has been lobbying in the United States capital, Washington, , for a tougher American response to the atrocities committed by the Syrian government. He thinks he has failed. I was trying to get help for Syria and I failed. I didn't get the result I was hoping for. Kassem arrived in the United States in 2014 after embarking on a risky journey out of Syria. I had to walk from Syria to Lebanon at midnight. I was arrested by Syrian forces and was beaten. I later crossed the Lebanese border with a fake ID. I was lucky. I jumped on a bus and I went to Beirut. Since I entered Lebanon illegally I had turn myself in to the security forces the night before my plane was supposed to leave. They took my passport. I had to pay penalties, explains Kassem. After several hours of interrogation at the airport by the Lebanon security forces and the fortunate intervention of an acquaintance, Kassem was free to board for the United States I felt like Leonardo DiCaprio at a reception, jokes Kassem when asked to share his first impression after stepping out of the plane. Although thousands of miles away, Kassem grew up immersed in American culture. I learned English by reading the Reader's Digest when I was 5 years old. I taught myself English just because I liked America. As a little kid growing up in a dictatorship, reading all these stories about America looked awesome to me, says Kassem. Yet, he says he was surprised to witness homelessness in the United States Seeing homeless people next to the White House is something that caught my attention and I just couldn't believe to see homeless people in the most powerful country on earth. Like nearly 5 million Syrians, his family has been displaced. After fleeing to Jordan, his mother is now a refugee in Turkey. All of us are displaced. All my family members have left Syria, says Kassem. Three of my brothers had to take the death boat to Europe and went to Germany. I have another brother who right now is traveling to take a boat too. You can only imagine how I feel until I can hear that he is safe.
504	Kat	Philippines	China	I	I	close	3299	10229	E	im	female	Kat, a 23-year-old from the Philippines, has been forced to sell sex for Mama-san and her organised crime network since December when she was moved to Hong Kong under a recruiter's promise of a well-paying job and easy working conditions. A single mother, whose own mother is too sick to work, Kat jumped at the chance to earn a high salary but soon after arriving in Hong Kong, Mama-san confiscated her passport and sent her to work in the bar alongside other trafficked women. Clients pay up to 5,000 Hong Kong dollars ($650) to have sex with Kat but payment goes directly to her pimp. Without any money, she said she cannot escape or fly home - and besides, her traffickers know where her family lives. I'm depressed. The other bar girls are depressed. They have to force themselves to be happy and make jokes, said Kat, sobbing. The Chinese bar owner gets angry with me because I look so sad. Kat, who declined to give her real name, is one of hundreds of women who are trafficked to Hong Kong from mainland China, Southeast Asia, Europe and South America for forced prostitution in the city's brothels, bars, spas and pornography industry, rights activists say. Many victims do not speak out for fear of being punished by their traffickers, some of them linked to the powerful Triad organised crime group. Others are afraid of being deported home or criminalised for being in the possession of fake papers arranged by their pimps, campaigners say. I take a risk every time I go out with a male customer, said Kat, who also shudders at the parties she is made to attend where cocaine, marijuana and other drugs are used by clients and forced on the girls. They are great actresses because like one of them said, 'I need to show that I am happy and OK even when I am not'. This to me kills a soul, said Marcela Santos, an advocate for trafficking victims who did not want to give her real name, saying it may put at risk her work helping survivors with jobs, training and sometimes a flight home.  After hearing that her brother was left in a critical condition after an accident in the Philippines, she begged Mama-san to allow her to fly home. But the woman refused. I don't want to do this, Kat said. I want to get training and to apply for a job in a restaurant. I don't want to come back to Hong Kong.
505	Kate, Maddie, Mimi and Ella	United States	Cambodia	N	I	far	63123	1513	L	im	n	"Although theyre young, these sisters have experience with migration. Theyre living in Cambodia now but theyve also lived in Egypt, Indonesia, and Georgia, returning to the US every summer for holiday. I live overseas, we migrate because of our parents jobs, says Kate, 10 years old. I would really like to help my mom and her job, she works for IOM and they help migrants coming to Cambodia. Maddie, 8 years old, says I like living in different places because you get to experience different things. Her favorite thing about Cambodia when she arrived? Tuktuks! You get the breeze, sometimes taxi drivers in the US dont let you roll down the window, but in Tuktuks, you get breeze all the time. At the same time, going home in the summers is important to them: I like going home, says Mimi, age 7, because we get to see our family. Sometimes its hard living far away because we miss them so much. The girls agree that they are lucky to migrate for their parents work; they know that it isnt the case for everyone. Sometimes people migrate because of war, says Maddie, who believes that migration can benefit both the individual and the community. They know that some people dont get any support in the place theyve migrated to: there are big cities and there are lots of people that dont have very much, sometimes migrants do need help finding somewhere to stay and something to eat. Ella, 11, predicted that if nobody migrated, people will go crazy. For example, nobody would get jobs. Companies would shut down. People wouldnt get the food they needed. People wouldnt make that many friends. Some places could get sick and nobody else from another place could help. People wont learn much about different cultures and beliefs from other countries. In an effort to help migrants without support, Kate wants everyone in her family to donate a few things every year and hopefully encourage others to donate too. Maddie summarized their perspective well: migration is different, every persons experience migrating is unique, and migrant is not the only identity of a person who has left their home."
506	Katherina	Philippines	Libya	I	A	far	3299	4243	E	im	female	I came from a big family and I am the youngest girl. My parents never wanted me to leave and work abroad. We are very close, and they used to tell me you are here - you dont know how to live abroad. But after my father died and I got married, I spent six years working in Philippines. I wanted to get out. I wanted to go to America. This was the dream of a young girl. But I saw it, and the world, while working in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. They choose some nurses, including me, to serve the mother of Sheikh Mubarak. It was a nice experience to serve a royal family and go all around the world with them. I had to change my passport twice, because I had no papers left for the visas. Then I got bored of travelling, but I had to stay in Abu Dhabi because of my job. But there came a point where I needed my own freedom and to relieve the stress of taking care of a high-profile person. I was interviewed for a job by a Libyan delegate, who promised me many things. But when I got here things were different. Since I arrived here, I have been the nurses supervisor in the Oncology department. Its really tough. It was hard, at first, to work in the hospital because it is too big and crowded. I asked, Is this a hospital, or a shopping mall? Over the many years that I have been here, I have just adapted. What motivates me to do my job is the patients. Especially in these times, even if I dont work with patients directly, this is still what keeps me coming to serve them. But now, under the current tense circumstances int he country, we lack everything. For many months, the central storage has been empty. I keep trying to find someone to donate, and some give me money to at least buy the surgical tubes. And under this situation, everyone is angry and now most of the staff have started working side jobs in the private sector. None of us have received our monthly salaries for a long time. What I love about Libya is people themselves. They are so nice and simple. I have attended a few weddings and I like the fashion. I only go to see the gowns, as they are so nice. Everyone shows off their dresses. On the side, I enjoy playing my guitar and playing in church. I spend most of the time in housing with my colleagues. We used to do parties and birthdays, but now the economic situation that effected Libyans is also affecting us. We cant even send or receive from outside cash in banks. And within the black-market exchange, my salary is worth ess than $200 USD.
507	Katherine Tinoco Reyes	Peru	United Kingdom	L	E	far	6163	40718	H	im	female	My name is Katherine Tinoco Reyes. I am Peruvian and I have been living in the United Kingdom for 2 years. My husband is British and that's why we came together to study a master's degree in London and follow our dreams. Having left my country and my loved ones, nostalgia is part of my every day. This motivated my need to fill that void with activities related to my beloved and remembered Peru. Today from the distance, our customs, typical dishes, dances, and everything Peruvian is invaluable, which boosted my need to start my search for these activities. Dancing has always been my passion and I enjoy doing it. I did it since I was a child. Like my father always tells us it is in the blood and what is inherited cannot be stolen. I participated in different folkloric events in my school and university, I even was part of the dance events of the Brisas del Titicaca cultural association. There I developed and complemented many of my dance skills with the typical dances of Peru. With the vision of being able to transmit this experience and passion I started ArtPerUK! An initiative that I founded in May 2019. By teaching other migrant compatriots to dance to Peruvian music, we learn and have fun by sharing the rich musical culture thanks to dancing. I started with a program of typical dances from Peru, considering dances from the coast, mountains and jungle like 'festejo', 'caporales' and the popular 'anaconda', at the facilities of Queen Mary of London University. Forthcoming classes will include 'valicha', 'marinera', among others, but we are going step by step to be able to learn together. The participants, for now, are Peruvian residents in the United Kingdom who want to practice, improve and enjoy a few hours with compatriots who share the passion for Peru and our dances. We have also had Spanish and Latin participants and I hope, one day, to have British students in order to spread the Peruvian culture. ArtPerUK has more than 120 interested students, classes are 30 to 35 students on average and we have made presentations at public events to showcase our talent and continue to transmit the Peruvian culture where we are going. For our national holidays we produced a flashmob in London Bridge. It was a joy for many Peruvians and their families to see how their relatives who are so far away participate in these cultural activities! My vision for the future is to be able to make this a base initiative to form a dance cast that can participate in different events in London and thus improve the propagation of Peruvian culture. I hope this initiative continues and grows, so that we can leave a legacy to our families in the United Kingdom and know that we did something so they can learn more about our wonderful country, Peru.
508	Katie	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	female	"I fell in love with England during my undergraduate degree when I visited for two weeks. I had been studying Victorian Britain that semester and I couldn't have been more excited to visit London and the South East. Based on that brief trip, I decided to spend time in London on a young-person's work visa (working for the Somerset House Trust) at the end of my degree. A few years later I moved back again to complete an MA. By that point I had married an Englishman whom I had met years previously. We had intended only to return to the UK for a short time for my studies, but neither of us wanted to leave. Seven years later we had our first child, a happy little dual-citizen. I now have two MAs (that I paid for myself at international rates) and am working towards my doctorate in Religious Studies and Cultural History. Over the last 7+ years I have volunteered and interned for the National Trust, worked for the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Science Museum London, and Historic Royal Palaces. I love learning about and sharing British history through museum work and have particularly enjoyed my time with the National Trust working with young school groups and families. I could not have had these jobs, with this subject matter, back in the US. I feel proud of my adoptive country and hope that my doctorate will only help with further contributing to society through education and research. The hardest part about being an immigrant is being so far away from family. We recently relocated temporarily back to my home state of New York so that I could write up my thesis and spend time with my loved ones. However, it has also been difficult to spend years working for a population who didn't always seem to recognize my right to call England my home. I was often asked by visitors to the museums I worked at why I was in the UK and what I was doing working at 'X' museum. When I would greet visitors to Kew Palace (Historic Royal Palaces), I frequently was interrupted with the question, 'What are you doing here?' Whilst I can understand that an American accent greeting a visitor at a British cultural heritage location might be jarring, these types of questions always felt off-putting and unnecessary. And yet I know that the prickly behavior I, at times, experience, is nothing in comparison to the negative experiences of some many other immigrant populations. It is also quite a different experience from that of my husband in the US, where his English accent (often mistaken for Irish or Australian) inspires warmth and friendliness; 'oos' and 'ahhs'. It's funny how we can be so variable in how we treat immigrants. Americans would not, and have not been so kind to people of other backgrounds as they are to my English husband. Why does the appearance, or voice, of one immigrant engender kindness, while another contempt? For the most part we want to be in our adoptive countries. We call those places home. We love them and contribute to them. For many, like myself, it is the desire to contribute that draws us there. I am grateful to this project for highlighting these important issues."
509	Kayla	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	female	I was born and educated in the American midwest but at age 18 I fell in love with an Englishman. After 5 years of transatlantic dating we finally married and I moved to the UK on a 2 year spousal visa. I achieved permanent residency after passing the Life in the UK test and paying for a further visa. I have volunteered extensively during my time here including leading Brownies, dog walking at shelters and helping at big, one-off events like the London Olympics. Throughout my entire time in the UK I have worked in the third sector. I'm lucky enough to currently be involved in social investment, an amazing force for good that allows social entrepreneurs to run businesses that give back to their communities. I feel very fortunate to have arrived when I did, as the process has only gotten more expensive and more difficult for those who want to make this little island our home.
510	Kevin	United States	Cambodia	N	I	far	63123	1513	L	im	male	I arrived to Cambodia 12 years ago. I came as a psychologist and a Catholic priest from the United States of America and I have been providing psychological support in Cambodia to those in need. Of course, moving to a new place is never easy, and understanding the language and culture can be big barriers for anyone. However, for me, the key is being open to others. Whether that involves being open to others similarities or differences, we can embrace all the great benefits of migration and the multi-cultural society it provides. I often think about how so many people on a global level are driven from their home or even their country because of war or persecution, as it occurred in Cambodia decades ago.  With that in mind, we must remember that migrants are human beings, and as human beings we need to help each other.  This is especially true for those who have endured war and hardships that have made it impossible or extremely difficult to remain in their home country. I am a migrant and I believe that migration works as a bridge over the divide of misunderstanding and the unknown and serves exchange culture, language and life from one country to another. I hope I am part of that bridge.

My dream was to come here to fine tune the skills I had acquired. France is known for the quality of its medical education. Moreover, I have been dreaming of the Paris I could see on TV, all lit up by the Eiffel Tower! I already had the opportunity to visit France and I decided to settle there. I was not trained in France. I came here ready: ready to work hard, to do long shifts. Ready to treat patients in France, to set an example just as many other foreign doctors already do in France. I didnt face any difficulty to integrate, and I felt very well welcomed. Me wearing a headscarf at the hospital is not an issue; on the contrary, the women in my unit help me reposition it when I get dressed to leave the operating room! Sometimes, patients can be a little wary when they hear my accent, but what I usually hear from them is really heartwarming: We are lucky to have foreign doctors in France. I dont know how we would do otherwise."

There, I met my husband, a Swiss national who was born in Belgium and living in Africa . Europe never appealed to me and I never dreamt of living there. Africa was and still is my continent of heart! However, at the age of 20, I followed my husband to Belgium when he decided to go back for work reasons. The very first time I set foot in Europe, I was not impressed but Im grateful now for what it offered me: a first contract as a musician, which allowed me to pursue my dream: purchase a plane ticket to go back to Burundi! Unfortunately, the war broke out in 1993 and due to the embargo, I decided to move back to Europe I chose to settle in Principality of Monaco with a vivid dream in mind: to go back to Africa one day. And so I left to Mali, in a small village, where I live 6 months per year. Why Mali? I traveled a lot in my life and I literally fell in love with the country and with the people. I decided to work with women in my village though little projects. Women are so willing to work, and they never give up despite the hard time they go through. There is a daily solidarity and humanity in Africa that I did not see in Europe when I arrived a few decades ago. I thought people felt lonely in Europe while Africans live within a community. Now I have to say that I feel home on both continents. Im happy to live in Monaco but lets say that I breathe better in Africa. I see migration as the most empowering and enriching process in the world. Migrants carry and bring with them their culture, tastes and knowledge; ranging from food to music. It brings people together. It is magic!"

I am Somali who fled to Holland as a refugee over 25 years ago. The migrants I assist come from remote villages and are not well informed of the world, so I rely on my experiences as a migrant to assist them. I am proud of having fully integrated into dutch society; because I realized that only when you speak their language, and become familiar with their culture, the people will feel pride, and they'll want to approach you and teach you more. Our profet [SAW] said: 'If you wish to migrate, be educated and knowledgable about where it is you are going and act respectfully.' ‎So if you want to migrate, do you know where you are going? The majority of people Ive interviewed in the ‎migration center here in Djibouti, I ask them: 'Why do you want to migrate to Saudi Arabia?' I thought it might be for religious reasons being that it is a Holy Land, but 70% of them didn't even know of the Mecca. I asked them: 'Are you going there to pray and return?' and they'd ‎answer: 'To pray? What do you mean?' If the person infront of you is nice they'll explain to you that in that country things happen in a certain way, but if this person thinks differently with a different vision of the world they'd tell you to go back to your country of origin. It is you who decided to come to this country, so you should know where it is that you've arrived."
514	Khairi	Jordan	Bulgaria	M	E	far	4283	10058	E	im	male	"Khairi is a writer. He has written his own books and translated several from Arabic to Bulgarian and vice versa. He has worked at a television station in Brussels and now organizes public readings in Sofia. The question where am I from? is hard for me to answer. I was born in Palestine and I grew up in Jordan, after which I came to Bulgaria to study engineering. So I am a Jordanian with a Bulgarian citizenship, born in Palestine, but in my passport it says I was born in Israel. That is why I am not sure how to answer that question between these four countries, maybe just that I am a citizen of this world. I still feel connected to Jordan since that is the country where my parents still live. I am able to visit them every year. I decided to stay in Bulgaria because I feel like I belong here; it feels right. So when asking me why I live in Sofia, I think you should ask why Sofia lives in me. The thought that someone is home in the country he is born in is correct to some extent, but when you grow up with a lot of crisis around you and witness unpleasant things, you can feel better at some other place then your country. For me; I feel home where I feel free and good. When visiting a new place I look at two things. First, I have to learn the place from a geographical point; the streets, the cafés and from there I find my orientation. Second, I find the faces of people interesting, they say a lot about the country. One summer we were in Varna near the beach, we rented an apartment and sat down with our landlord for a drink. At one point he asked me where I am from. I thought to myself he noticed my accent. After which the landlord asked where I am from again. I said Desharav, a small town in Palestine. After which he replied: Oh that is in the Vratsa region (a city in North-West Bulgaria), right?"
515	Khaled	Sudan	Lebanon	A	M	far	1415	9310	H	im	male	"My name is Khaled, and I am from South Kordorfan, Sudan. I am a refugee who helps move refugees. I have worked with IOM for over 20 years, since I came to Lebanon as a refugee myself after leaving Sudan because of the war going on there. I am here with my family, as are most of the guys who work here. We come from all over Sudan—Khartoum, Darfur, South Kordofan. Some of us have been here for a while. The person who has been here the shortest has been here for six years. We came here via Syria back in the day, because Sudan and Syria had an agreement about visas. So we went there first and then crossed to Lebanon. Life here has been hard, because some of the guys still have not been formally registered with UNHCR. There have been some problems and some of them had their applications rejected. I know how hard life can be for a refugee. So part of me is very glad to be assisting other refugees. But part of me wonders why some of these people have only been registered for a couple of months and are already being resettled, when we have been waiting for so many years. I have done many jobs over the years; driver, security, resettlement operations. My daughter is twenty years old now and is also getting ready to start working. She has to finish her studies first. She wants to be an attorney somewhere abroad.   Khaled leads the team of porters and operational support staff for the Canadian Resettlement of 11,000 Syrian refugees from Lebanon to Canada."
516	Khaleds family	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	n	"Do you know where Id really like to be relocated? To Cyprus! Khaled said, eyes sparkling. The climate is nice, the place is beautiful, but do you know what the most important thing to me is? That every morning I will take a deep breath and smell the fragrance of my beloved Syria, on the other side of the sea. Khaled, a 32-year-old builder from Hama, Syria, arrived on the island of Chios in March 2016, with his wife Hyam and their children, Suleiman, Amina and Hamzeh. After spending a month in the makeshift camp of Piraeus port, they were sent to the Agios Andreas camp, northeast of Athens. We met the family at Marathon Beach Resort on an unusually busy day: IOM staff were there to distribute winter clothing and shoes. The hotel, in a sleepy coastal town not far from Athens, is the place that about 100 refugees called home for more than a month while construction work was being done at the near-by Agios Andreas camp. Khaled, although hes the last in line to receive the winter gear, doesnt mind: he explains that his family has a lot to be thankful for so far. During their stay at the camp the family encountered some urgent medical issues. We are thankful for all the help we received from IOM staff at the time, although it was a really stressful period. They have been there for us, they assisted us with the hospital, the medication, everything, said Khaled. Hyam recently gave birth to their 4th child, Malak. IOM staff assisted her during her pregnancy, as well. And hows life at the hotel? After living in a tent for so long, its really nice and comfortable, Khaled said as his children played all around the small but cosy room. Soon, the discussion leads us to the family's future plans; they had already started the relocation procedures. My brother-in-law is already in Germany and my sister has applied for the family reunification programme. So, we would like to be all together. If not, then its definitely Cyprus that Id choose! Khaled exclaimed."
517	Khraw and Elena	India	Romania	I	E	far	1931	12929	H	im	n	Elena and Khraws marriage may be one of the most beautiful examples of true love. Khraw left India for Brasov, Romania, to marry Elena after five years of online chatting and dating. We wanted to see if we were on the same page, if we shared the same perspectives and values, Khraw explained. It took me some time to adapt to Romania with the language barrier, cultural differences, food, etc., Khraw added. I felt lonely in the first two weeks. In India you see 50 people walking on a street at any given time, whereas in Braşov, you rarely see more than five people. Finding a job without knowing the language was one of the most difficult things. It took me three years to find a permanent position. I felt much better after finding a church. The community helped me feel at home. The immigration centre in Brasov played a very important role in the whole adjustment process in terms of learning Romanian and meeting people facing the same challenges. I am also really grateful to my in-laws, who were by my side the whole time and made things easier for me, he continued. Despite the many differences between Romania and India, Elena thinks that Khraw has managed to adapt successfully and sees in him the man she always wished for. Romania and India are totally different, from the streets and climate to the people and food, she recounted. Khraw makes his food exactly like he did at home, but he got used to our traditional cuisine: he likes soup and sarmale, but everything should be with rice, more precisely long grain rice. I like his tenderness. He supports me in everything I want. I told him once: I want to buy many books for our children, because I didnt have many when I was young. I want to read to our children every day, she concluded. Khraw misses his family and wishes he could still help them out. He also misses the close bond he had forged with his friends over the years. But he is confident about the choices he made. I dont regret my decision because I have an awesome partner, my wife, and two wonderful boys who keep me busy, he concluded. They undoubtedly fill the void. My family is my home and home is indeed where your heart belongs. So, yes, Romania is home for me.
518	Khurram	Pakistan	Greece	I	E	far	1167	18117	H	im	male	My name is Khurram. I was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan. I have 4 sisters and 2 brothers. I went to school for 10 years and studied at the National College of Arts, in Lahore. After finishing my studies, I worked as a fashion designer and decorator. However, my city had religious and political problems. So, one day in July 2017, a political conflict broke out and I was almost killed. I was thrown hot water and at my body and it is burned on the one side. Fortunately I saved my face. The next day I decided to go to Greece for a better life. It took me a month to get to Turkey. It cost me time and money. I did not intend to go to another European country. I am an artist and I wanted to explore the vibrant Greek ancient and contemporary art and culture, and draw inspiration from them. It is a place of cultural importance that can trigger human creative abilities and motivate every artist. I want to go back for two reasons. Although I have a lot of ideas, I do not have enough job opportunities here. Furthermore, in December 2017 my mother died and I feel bad I was not there. Now my father is sick in the hospital and I want to be at his side. That is why, participating in IOMs AVRR project was my only solution. At this crucial moment, it is very important for me to be with my family. The programme The implementation of Assisted Voluntary Returns, including Reintegration measures (AVRR) is co-funded 75% by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund of the European Union (AMIF) and 25% by the Hellenic Ministry of Interior.
519	Klaus	Germany	Australia	E	O	far	45909	55823	E	im	male	Originally from Bremen in northern Germany, Klaus departed for Australia with his family in November 1954. It was my parents decision – mainly my father. Germany was sandwiched between Russia and America so politically, it wasnt very good. And my father was a bit of an adventurer. Its so hard to tell you what it was like. Just getting on a ship and standing on the deck and looking over to Pireas and seeing three hundred Greeks arrive all dressed in black. With all their belongings in baskets. After arriving in Melbourne in January 1955 and spending a few days at a migrant camp, Klauss family moved to Orange, New South Wales. Reflecting on life as a migrant, Klaus says there were two different cultures operating. There was the Australian culture at school and with his mates and then the old German ways at home. My siblings and I were going like crazy to adapt to Australia and become Australian. Germany just disappeared in a way. I was so busy adjusting, learning the language and all of the other nuances of being in this society, that there was very little reinforcement of what had happened in Germany. Later, however, Klaus began to question his identity and sought to make sense of it all during a visit to Germany. I started recording a lot of family history and wrote down all that stuff, kept a diary, went through peoples documents and compiled a family tree. Because Id been so dislocated, I wanted to know what those old roots were. I had a great sadness. There was no continuity of all the stories, all the folklore, all the lore. It was just cut off. Klaus, now a grandfather, is part of a big family again. Weve created our own milieu… Its all around me. Weve got sixty one years of it. But, for a migrant, Klaus says reflecting is a lifelong process. When he was awarded the Order of Australia for service to conservation and the environment in 2012 he had, what he calls, an aha moment. The honour was like a pat on the back or a handshake from his adopted homeland: Yes, youve been accepted. You are now Australian.
520	Kleio	Greece	Denmark	E	E	close	18117	61477	E	im	female	"I live in Denmark, where I am a researcher in migration, education and culture. I also work as a freelance communication associate and organizer for multicultural events. I am a migrant working for migrants! In early 2013 at the age of 27, I left Greece because I wanted to do my Masters in Denmark. My main goal, though, was to pursue better life opportunities in order to help my family financially.   When I first arrived in Denmark, my first impressions were quite negative; I felt no connection to the people and the culture whatsoever. Yet, after four and a half years, not only have my impressions changed, I have changed too — for the better, I hope. I observed and understood the Danish culture and way of thinking and I softened my views and my reactions towards the seemingly peculiar things that were happening around me.   I have my personal culture though, I don't feel that I am fully assimilated into the Danish culture nor that I kept my Greek culture intact. I have expanded beyond these stereotypes. I still miss the Greek warmth though, not only the weather but the warmth of the people.   I have experienced many different migrant statuses in the years since I left Greece; I was an international student and afterwards a migrant worker. I can say that a migrant is a person that leaves their home country in a pursuit of something different. The reasons behind migration are those that define the true meaning of the word migrant; it could be forced migration due to conflict or war, initiated by economic reasons, could be a change of life plans, a career, following a partner, seeking adventure or extraordinary experiences and more. But at the end of the day, home is where your loved ones and meaningful connections are. Right now, I have two homes.   The biggest challenge I had to overcome as an immigrant was, and still is, the fact that I have to prove myself again. Having no connections or friends, nobody to believe in me, I had to build everything from scratch in a somewhat alien environment. Yet I am confident in what I carried with me to the new country; an ability to think outside the Danish box, eagerness to achieve things, flexibility, creativity and passion. I also bring warmth and some spiciness!"
521	Koffi	Togo	Niger	L	A	far	863	568	E	im	male	After my father died a few years ago, I saved a bit of money and decided to go to Libya. During the five years I spent there, I pretended to be Muslim. I realized when I left that if I wanted to survive, this is what I had to do. I learned Arabic, read the Koran and prayed every single day. A friend told me at some point he got a call from a Libyan woman who was looking for black men to be friends with and transfer them money. I advised him to mind his own business, make some money and get back home as fast as he could. He didnt listen to me and he is dead now. Some women cheat on their husbands and then go back home and confess so then the husbands come after you. Libyans dont like seeing black men with white women - for them its a sin. One day at the supermarket I was working at, as I was unloading a womans groceries into her car, she tells me she has a job for me. She says she liked that I was clean and that I spoke good Arabic. I asked what kind of job and she said it wasnt exactly a job, but that it was paid. I thank God I didnt go to prison, but many of my friends are currently still in prison in Libya because of the women they met there and the situations they got themselves into. I dont wish anyone to experience prison in Libya. You see 10-year-olds driving cars, loaded with guns and ready to kill you. Their dads are mostly likely dead so now they have become the providers for their families. The things Ive seen there are hard to talk about: women raped, people killed in front of my eyes. Its very hard to find work nowadays in Libya, and when they do offer you work, its not actually paid, but you cant complain otherwise they hurt you. You need to have your employer pick you up and drop you off from work every day otherwise you are at risk of getting killed. One day, my friend went to the shop around the corner and got shot. I never really wanted to go all the way to Italy, but my boss said he could take me. Once in Tripoli, I saw how they boarded 200 people onto the boat and decided it wasnt worth the risk so I went back. You tell people your story hoping they change their minds, but for some seeing is believing. They are determined, life or death, to make it to Europe.
522	Kojo	Ghana	Libya	A	A	close	2206	4243	E	im	male	"Through Kojos Eyes: Aspirations of a Young Ghanaian Migrant   Welcome bro! Great to have you back! I trust you had a good flight? This is how I welcomed Kojo at Kotoka International Airport, in Accra on 27 July 2017. Kojo, 24, had just returned to Ghana from Libya, on a charter flight organized by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). He looked exhausted, lost. But there was also a sparkle of relief in his eyes. I work as a project officer for IOM in Ghana. Soon after meeting Kojo, we sat down together and started the registration process. I asked him a series of questions: where he came from, what was he doing before he left Ghana, and whether he had family members that we should contact. Then I gave him the small amount of pocket money he was entitled to receive. A smile stretched across his face. I am happy to be back. I feel a bit disappointed, but Im alive and that is the most important thing after all, Kojo said. Our conversation went on for a little while longer, but 137 other people had arrived on the same charter flight — the first organized by IOM between Libya and Ghana. I knew that registration and screenings would keep IOM staff awake through the night, so Kojo and I agreed to talk again as soon as possible. A few days later, we met at the IOM premises in Accra to resume our discussion. Kojo, like most of the young Ghanaians we welcomed home that night in July 2017, is young and able-bodied — full of energy and the best intentions for his family. He comes from the Brong Ahafo Region in Ghanas countryside, where the youth feel trapped by a lack of sustainable economic opportunities. For Kojo, poverty has been passed down through several generations and his hopes for change and a better future for his family have long been lost. It took Kojo nearly a year to raise USD 500, what he considered a sufficient amount before his departure to Libya in 2015. He raised the amount from working his maize farm, with support from his sister and brother-in-law who hoped, to get some money back when Kojo made it to Europe — even if it would take decades. Remittances, especially those received in regular instalments, can represent both a source of income and a safety net for families back home in Ghana. The thought that another family member could be helped to travel abroad by a relative who made it is also a motivating factor for some. As such, families do not question collective support for migration. Kojos original destination was not Libya but Germany, where his friend lives. I would have preferred to use legal means. But its quite difficult to enter Europe. I was told that the only way we can only get in is through irregular means, Kojo explained. It was a daring move I made, he continued. I had heard a lot about the dangers people face — some lose their lives. But I was not deterred. I was determined to get to Europe so I [could] take care of my family. I wish I had received proper advice because though I dared, I gave up in the middle of the desert. I [regret] that. Before he left, Kojo had many aspirations, including training to be a software engineer; but he couldnt achieve this because he couldnt afford it. Now, he wants to salvage that dream. After acquiring a certificate in electronics, I enrolled in a Highest National Diploma [programme] to upgrade myself, said Kojo, describing his education before he decided to leave Ghana. I had to drop out for financial reasons. I wanted to become an engineer. If things had gone as planned, I would have pursued that goal. But all is not lost — I have returned with a lot of brilliant ideas that I can implement. Kojo has battled stigmatization and marginalization from both his friends and close relatives since coming back to Ghana. But he doesnt see himself as a failure. He believes that he will achieve the new goals he has set for himself. My family has not been supportive ever since I came. They see me as a failure, but I refuse to be labelled as such. I have a strong willpower to succeed. I am not thinking about migration again. I am thinking about success — I am motivated to succeed, he added. Kojo is currently receiving support to set up an electrical shop through the EU-IOM Joint Initiative. This, he believes, will help him with the necessary funds from savings to further his education and to pursue his career goals."

He visited Vanua Levu; he didnt want to go at first, but his friends convinced him and he stayed with my aunt who later introduced us. We wrote to each other for about a year and then we got married. I have been living in Australia for four years now and our daughter was born here. I come from an Indo-Fijian culture. People you meet down the street are friendly and I quickly noticed when I came to Australia that communication was different here. I felt homesick straight after I came. I had difficulty understanding the cultural differences and expressing myself. Then I joined the multicultural centre in my community and I received a lot of support from migrants and local friends. I had my daughter and my world started to change. I still miss my home country but my foundation is now here and I dont think I can leave Australia now. I have recently started new studies in medical practice and I hope to soon become a sonographer. Its going to be a few hard months ahead as I have to study over the weekends but I have met so many people in my community who have inspired me to study and work hard to accomplish my goals. I love my community and how welcoming it has been and I appreciate them sharing their stories with me. Meeting people from other countries that share my lived my experience makes me feel better. I know Im not alone."
524	Kristi	Estonia	Estonia	E	E	close	23106	23106	E	hc	female	Kristi was born in a southern Estonian town, Võru, to an Estonian-Yemeni family. Due to her fathers job in engineering the family moved to Kuwait. Years after, she moved to Yemen for graduate studies. At home Kristi spoke Estonian to her mother, Arabic to her father, and English to her siblings and heard her parents speak Russian to each other. Expressing myself feels most natural in English. I enjoy Estonian as I understand the Estonian mentality. Estonian language has its own characteristics and irony. Yet, in reading and writing my Arabic is the strongest as I acquired most of my education in this language. Ive decided to become an English teacher. The NGO Im working for is devoted to humanitarian aid, development cooperation and global education. I now teach at workshops on Arabic countries and Islam. Im used to moving and like the idea that so many people are living abroad. Some people might not have one specific place as their country of origin, yet Im sure its something everyone might wish for. I am connected to certain places because of my background. I loved Yemen even though I had never been there before and it was because of the connection I had. When I think of my migration journey, I just dont understand why some people have rights to move and others dont. Do we help people because we like them or because they are in need? Bringing change starts with us – we need to work on ourselves, be active, honest and courageous to express our thoughts. Its dangerous when we all think alike, use words we dont understand or speak of ideals our own lives do not embody. Much can be rebuilt, but you cannot rebuild people. I cant imagine my life if I were to lose all people dear to me. So, my dreams for the future are simple – that my children and loved ones are well and we are together. I wish the same for all humanity.
525	Kristina	Estonia	Norway	E	E	close	23106	66871	E	im	female	"I had never studied or worked abroad and longed to experience something new. I was looking for ways to better establish myself in Estonia. I came to a point where I realised there is nothing my country does to improve my salary or work environment; I really didn't see myself affording to buy a car or an apartment with my salary. Depending on my parents or a future boyfriend was not an option for me. I had to do something. Moving abroad and earning a better salary was the plan I came up with. I planned to stay in Norway no longer than two years. As I came with a job agency I really had no choice about where I will be living and working in Norway. I was informed that my first stay shall be in the north, in Vadsø. Northern Norway is nothing like the South or East of Norway; I find it extremely beautiful and calm. My first impression was – this place has a lot of immigrants already! Also, I quickly learned that Norway is way too expensive and Norwegians are really nice and easy-going people. I have been here for a year and a half now. I work as a nurse and in spare time engage in my hobbies – taking long walks, going for picnics, driving a snow scooter, looking at aurora borealis and enjoying life in the Norwegian way. My plans took an unexpected twist. I met the man of my dreams, my boyfriend, and my plans have changed, I am hoping to stay here now. As a result of living abroad I have become thankful for what I have. More than before, I appreciate my time with family and friends. My family means the world to me. Now, I have more opportunities to help my family. Also, I am completely independent, making my own decisions, paying my own bills and spending my own money. I think its important for a young adult to experience hard times, which prepare one for life. It can happen either at home or abroad, as long as it's happening. In my experience language is important for good integration. It is extremely difficult to live in another country even if the cultures do not feel that different. One needs to be open-minded about accepting the culture, habits and traditions of the host society. For integration to work, people of the host society have to tolerate you and have the desire to help you integrate. It is an effort on both sides, the newcomer and the host society. I hope to come back to Estonia one day, but more than anything, I want my family to do well, feel safe and cared for. I really want Estonia to do well. Fixing up a post-Soviet country is not easy, but it is possible. I hope Estonia takes in more immigrants, because it will create a good balance between emigration and immigration, the brain drain and the talent gain. I hope Estonia heals its weak points and makes Estonians happier people."

I had been living in Greece for 7 years and with IOM Greece's help I returned back to my country in March 2017. Now, I have a dairy farm in Bajola village, in India's Kapurthala district. I own land outside of my house and I share this space with my brother, who is also a farmer and manages a buffalo business. I used IOMs Reintegration Assistance and I started my business with the purchase of two buffaloes. Then I managed to expand my business as I bought three more buffaloes. My income is around 10,500 INR per month. My brother assisted me a lot as this is a family business. Since the buffaloes produce milk only four to five months per year, I also work in agriculture as supplementary work, receiving a monthly salary of 25,000 INR. At present, I have enough savings and I decided to expand my business by taking a loan. Ι believe that when there is no risk, there is no profit. I will risk for this family business. Thank you IOM, you helped me to start, and I will go on.
527	Laila	Italy	Italy	E	E	close	31238	31238	E	hc	female	I have Tunisian parents but I was born and raised in Milan, so I am a second generation migrant. Now there are more migrants here, but when I was young there were only Italians. Outside my household, I was exposed to Italian life with its language and religion, while within my household l spoke another language – Tunisian, a mixture of French and Arab – practiced a different religion, and ate different food. So it felt like I was in Italy but every time I set foot in my house I was back in Tunisia. I always lived both realities, and that is why my identity is hard to define. I feel Italian and Tunisian, fully. My mom used to tell me this since I was 7 years old: Remember, you are not 50% one and 50% the other, you are 100% Italian and 100% Tunisian, you are complete. There was only one time when I experienced an identity conflict, and it was when the World Trade Center was attacked. Everybody was telling me, Youre a Taliban, your father is a Taliban! or asking me Why dont you wear the veil? In that moment I realized that I wasnt exactly like everyone else, like I thought. I was always curious to know how Italians lived in Tunisia, since I am a Tunisian living in Italy. There was a massive migration from Sicily to Tunisia right after Italian Unification in 1861. There is a big Italian diaspora, where they are known as Kif kif, which means look-alikes since they were considered to be very Tunisian-looking. The first time I visited Tunis by myself, I went to an Italian neighborhood where I had the chance to meet the Italian community there, and I was so excited to meet a man who talked in Sicilian, French, and also in the Tunisian dialect! I am studying Political Science because I would like to become a diplomat, and work on relations between Italy and Tunisia. Id serve as an Italian diplomat in Tunisia rather than the other way around because I feel diplomacy was born in Italy, and I feel proud to be part of something that was the first of its kind.

Laith and Suhad along with their two daughters come from Iraq and were eager to overcome all obstacles in their way in order to make Bucharest their new home. They were living in Baghdad but because of the eruption of violence in the city they decided to fly to Turkey and from there to Romania. We were afraid for our lives. As a man it might be weird to say so, but I was utterly frightened. Laith first arrived in Bucharest last June with a business stay permit. After three months apart, the rest of the family flew from Turkey to Romania and joined him last September. We gave up going to classes; it was too dangerous to leave the house. We couldnt even go to buy basic products at the market without the fear of losing our lives, their daughters said. Here in Romania their life style has improved significantly. Both of them have enrolled as students at the University of Medicine Carol Davila and hope for a future career in the medical domain, be it in Romania or another country, as long as it is far from war. They feel at ease with the tranquillity of Bucharest and enjoy liberty of choice for their activities. I like that I can go out here whenever I wish, one of the daughters said. An obstacle they are still facing however is getting acquainted to the new language. Though they have started taking Romanian lessons, they still have a long way to mastering it. This communication inability has also prevented Laith from finding a job so far, even though he is a skilled and well-experienced engineer. But he still strives to find proper employment in hope for an opportunity to show up. Fortunately he can still support his family with his savings, but only for the moment."

Tambacounda means Tambas home.  By February 2015, I had managed to save nearly 800,000 CFA (approximately 1,400 USD) and was finally ready to pursue my goal: Europe. Full of hope, I slung my small bag over my shoulder, kissed my mother good bye, promising to continue sending financial support and to keep in touch, and, together with five childhood friends, headed off into the unknown - to Mali. Getting to Mali was easy and the trip went smoothly, which filled us with optimism. The rules were simple: there are 20 police check points to cross on the way to Burkina Faso, each one costs 5,000 CFA (approximately 9 USD).

We followed the rules and crossed into Burkina Faso after only a few days travel. In Burkina Faso, the authorities caught us.  I knew I had to escape, fearing that otherwise the same fate awaited me. That night, the stars were on my side. Strong winds and heavy rain pounded the center and at four oclock in the morning, along with 10 others, I crawled through a window and ran. Running turned to walking, and walking to hobbling as the sun rose and the grueling heat set in. Having long lost our shoes, we walked the 130 kilometers through Burkina Faso to cross into Niger barefoot, on our way to Niamey. Two of the younger and weaker members of our group became delirious from foot infections and dehydration and we had to carry them.  I dont know if Europe is really a paradise or not. But I know that if reaching that paradise means losing what I lost, suffering what I suffered, seeing what I saw, enduring what I endured, then I would much rather be home in Tambas home.

My mother worked in Algeria before that and my father and I had joined her. Each new move we made was mainly based on my mothers work placement. Im a very curious person and I wasnt afraid of having a new life at a new place surrounded by new people. Im always eager to learn more about new countries and cultures. In Algeria, because of my appearance, everyone thought I was Algerian and was very surprised to know that I dont know Arabic. I enjoyed discovering that interesting country, I realized its traditions were influenced by the French culture. Now Im married to a Belarusian man and I study here; I love Belarus. Before coming here, I thought What can people do there without the sea? What does snow look like? Now I understand that theres a lot to see and do here, and. I got to see snow! At first it was also really cold for me but now Im used to the Belarusian weather. Of course it was not easy for me when I first came here. I faced a language barrier at school and I realized that I had different priorities from those of my classmates because of cultural norms I think. In Cuba, 14-year-old people are more mature, here people of the same age are still acting like kids taken care of by their parents. Secondly, because of my dark hair and tanned skin people thought Im a Gipsy; they have a bad reputation here. Now my Russian is far better and I have lighter hair, so nobody thinks Im a Gipsy anymore. Belarus's really a beautiful country with many places to visit. The geographical position is very good and its easy to travel to other European or Slavic countries, to learn different cultures. I would develop tourism here, so more foreigners come here and get to know this wonderful country. I would like to build my future career in this country."
531	Lauriane	France	Georgia	E	I	far	38959	3984	L	im	female	Georgia is one of those countries known only by a few people, however once they get to know the country, they always want to come back to it.  I work as a manager in an international non-governmental organization, and I came to the Caucasus for quite selfish reasons. After a long mission in Afghanistan, I wanted a posting in a place where I could have a more normal life, rent an apartment, and walk to the office. I got a job in Georgia, managing a project across Georgia and two neighboring countries. When I arrived in this totally different context, I did not feel I could really make a difference. The Georgian colleagues I worked with are bright, with master degrees and have traveled the world, just like me. Yet after some months I realized that I could contribute, I brought an outsider perspective, simply by not being Georgian and having spent longer periods of time in different contexts. After a year and a half, I carried on with postings in other countries. Yet Georgia is always on my mind! I came back with a new job full of new responsibilities. To Georgia I offer experiences from different countries, but Georgia offers me a lot too: opportunities for professional development, and also the possibility of a comfortable and thrilling life. I feel privileged as I am always treated as a guest. People always react positively to the fact that I am a foreigner, and seem to value the presence of foreigners. Im not sure it would be the case in the village I originally come from! Everyone in my field of work refers to people like me as expats. In reality, I am a migrant. I came to seek better professional opportunities, cultural discoveries. And after the many years I spend in Georgia, I hope to leave something positive behind.

Sometimes there are twenty people in the ghetto, sometimes one hundred. We tell people who we are and what we do, and then inform them about the dangers of irregular migration. They often say: Ok, youve come to our ghetto to inform us about the dangers of this route, but have you ever tried it yourself? So I tell them my story. I left Niger for Libya in 1991 without any papers and traveled part of the way in a gas tanker. I spent the next 18 years in Tripoli, where I learned Arabic and worked as a mechanic. Everybody is looking for work there. If you dont have any money in Libya, youre either a dead man or you become a criminal. I had a girlfriend in Libya, but we could never get married. If people even saw us together, they would have killed me. They say we are Muslim brothers, but thats just the mouth talking, not the heart. Back in my day, you could travel somewhat regularly. Nowadays, the drivers exchange passengers as if they were prisoners. Before, they would pick up 10 to 15 people and be satisfied with the load, but now they are greedy and they take 100 people instead -- imagine how these people travel, all squeezed in the back of a small pick-up truck. When I left, we reached Libya in 7 days. We would stop at night to have dinner, go to sleep, wake up in the morning and continue the trip. But now they sometimes drive all the way with no stops; you dont see any villages or get any water for days at a time. Ive made Libyan friends and they often call and tell me to come back, but when I left, I told myself I would never go back. Even if Libya was next door to Agadez, I wouldnt want to go back. Too many people die there. When I got back to Agadez, I started working in the uranium mine, got married and had a family. When they closed down the mine three years ago, I started working with IOM. You go to the ghettos and you realize people dont even know how long it takes to reach Italy by boat. They think theyll reach the other side in a couple of hours. Every time I leave a ghetto and a migrant decides to go back home, I feel content. We leave them our contact details and they often come by themselves to the orientation office or transit centre in Agadez. Its a dangerous job at times, but most of the community mobilizers grew up here. We have known the ghetto leaders since we were little, so people trust us. They know we just want to inform others."

In the Philippines, it is very difficult to find a job where you can earn a high salary. The first time I came to Kuwait I noticed that it looked different from pictures Ive seen. I was afraid of being home sick, but from my first day here I felt safe and comfortable, in contrast to the stories Ive heard from my friends who also work abroad. The family I work with is super nice to me. Ive been in Kuwait for almost two years but I dont feel home sick because they give me freedom to do the things I like, and most of all to play volleyball which is my favourite sport. Kuwait is a pleasant country, there is a large Filipino community here and I feel like Kuwait is my second home. My son used to suffer from leukemia, but he has been a cancer survivor for almost 7 years. It costs a lot of money to maintain his health so that the cancer doesnt return.  My mother is also very old and takes medication; she fully relies on me for support. Now I can say that my family is stable, and I plan to stay here as long as I can so that I can save enough to start up my own business back home."

But determined to help rebuild the nations economy for her fellow young people, Leen – a computer science undergraduate at the University of Damascus – has launched an award-winning, Arabic-language app to help young people in Syria, and beyond, learn to code. Just six months since its launch, Leens Remmaz app already has over 500 active users learning to code, design websites and develop apps (application programs) on the platform she and her business partner started developing while they were second-year university students. Their aim is to create an accessible, Arabic online learning MOOC (massive open online course) to address the lack of non-English programming resources available to Arab communities, particularly young people looking for employment in conflict-scarred Syria. Leen and her team are in the process of crunching the data to find out more about Remmazs users. However, they already know that most are based in Morocco and aged between 20 and 23 – university-age students looking for work opportunities, she suggests. Remmaz is a startup whose mission is to make an evolution in online learning about programming in the Arab world, to empower people to learn about cutting-edge technology tools through Arabic content, in an easy and accessible way, to let them be qualified for a job opportunity in one of the highest-paid jobs – programming, says Leen. Leen launched Remmaz after attending a three-week training course in December 2015, supported by the UNFPAs Innovation Fund, on how to start and manage a small business. She initially heard about the course through her startup incubator. Having developed her idea, she was keen to gain some commercial skills and make contacts. I began my startup when I was in the second year of university, so I lacked business knowledge and entrepreneurship culture, she says, speaking from her adopted city of Damascus; she left her home town of Harasta when the conflict made it untenable for her family to remain there. This program was a great opportunity, as the mentors and trainers have 20 years of real experience in this field, which was really important for me. At the end of the course, 17 projects were chosen for further UNFPA support. Along with Remmaz, they included computer maintenance, after-school programs and online computer games. More recently, Remmaz won an entrepreneurship competition for Syrian startups, taking a $15,000 prize that will go towards expanding the app, says Leen. After graduation this summer, Leen plans to take a masters degree in artificial intelligence and organize hackathons in collaboration with UNFPA and Damascus Girl Geeks. But she remains focused on her vision for Syria. Big businesses are closing and the problems we are facing only young people can solve, she says. The need for startups and entrepreneurship culture is really essential for Syria. This article originally appeared on Refugee Deeply."
535	Lefah	Mali	Ireland	A	E	far	856	86251	H	im	male	The music of Jingle Bells will always remind Ibrahim of the first day he stepped on to Irish soil. It was December 2nd, 2012, and Ibrahim, known as Lefah, had just flown from Mali to join his partner, Caitríona, for the birth of their daughter, Nina. The 30-year-old, who worked as a tour guide in his hometown of Ségou and had never left Africa before, found himself walking around Dundrum Town Centre with his heavily pregnant girlfriend, searching for warm winter layers. I was in awe of the escalators, the movement and the lights, he says. I asked, Who is this red man Im seeing everywhere?, and Caitríona told me the story of Santa Claus, a man who climbs down your chimney and flies away with reindeer. The couple met in early 2012 when Caitríona was travelling in West Africa. In March that year a coup broke out in Mali, and soon after she was evacuated to Burkina Faso. There was so much drama in those three months living together in Mali. We met in a coup. Nina was conceived in a coup, she says, adding that she returned to Ireland soon after and began making arrangements for Lefah to follow. After seven months of applications and appeals he was granted an Irish visa. He arrived three weeks before Nina was born.
536	Leonardo	Chile	Chile	L	L	close	13232	13232	E	hc	male	I traveled to Switzerland after finishing my first semester in political science at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso) in Chile. I settled in Switzerland for 16 years, got married, had a child, divorced, and had countless work and personal experiences. While I was living in Geneva, I had the opportunity to work at LUsine, a cultural center. There, I learned about electronic music and image projection (mapping). I am now back in Chile, per my own decision, to set up a business. My project at home consists of mixing music with mapping, and eventually replicating the model from the cultural center. It is starting slowly, but I am confident that I will be able to achieve it. I am currently searching for a business location and putting together a group of DJs for the project. Through its assisted voluntary return and reintegration (AVRR) programme, IOM provided me with financial support for my return to Chile. I would tell those who want to approach IOM to trust them, they are professionals. I have also been at the IOM Chile office and received additional assistance. When I returned to Chile from Switzerland, they waited for me at each airport to accompany me while I waited for departure, and they gave me the tranquility and support I needed so that I could arrive in Chile calm and confident. I advise migrants who are currently in difficult situations, like the ones I went through, that they should make the decision to return to their country if they are not well where they are or if they are suffering. While in Geneva, I heard about the case of an Ethiopian national who received the same help as I did, bought a cow and started making cheese, then bought another cow and another, and now owns a farm. You must start somewhere and, with the will to do so, you can be happy here, there, or wherever. I want to thank IOM for the help that they have given me, I am truly grateful. I would like to invite them to the inauguration of my project so that they can see what I have accomplished thanks to them.
537	Léonie and Marine	Cameroon	Niger	A	A	close	1502	568	E	im	n	"Years ago, the church took our land and tore down our house. I asked them to build us another house, but they refused. Weve been sleeping outside like beggars for years now, together with my mom and grandmother. Soon after, my son got hit by a car and died. I was scared I was going to lose my daughter as well seeing how she is pregnant. I told her we had to leave. All of our men leave the country so there are no men left in Cameroon. Or if you do find one, you have to have children, otherwise he will leave you or beat you. I was married for ten years and then we separated because I couldnt have any more children. I was hoping I would meet someone over there. These frustrations have pushed me to leave Cameroon in search for a better life. We left because we have no husbands, no money, nowhere to live, and nothing to lose. We wanted to go to Italy. We were told that if we made it to the other side, we would all get papers, seeing as she would give birth over there. The smugglers took us to a small village in Nigeria where they locked us up for five days. They searched us everywhere, stripped us naked. They didnt believe she was pregnant - they said she was hiding a pillow under her dress. We had no food or water. We both started feeling very sick. Marine was screaming and crying. People called their families to ask for money and they all left; we stayed – we had no one to call. Eventually, they let us go and we found our way to IOMs centre in Arlit. I was still set on continuing our journey to Europe so I didnt want to be registered at the centre. I told them I had nothing and no one to go back to. They told me to think about my daughter and her baby, but I told them that if the baby wanted to come out, he will have to wait until we reached the other side. I just wanted to spend one night at the centre before taking the road again. I kept thinking we were strong enough to make it. I didnt sleep at all that night. I met other Cameroonians at the centre who talked to me about their experiences on the road. One woman started crying when she heard I wanted to leave again. She told me how she had left for Libya with her daughter and saw her die with her own eyes. I have decided to go back, but I dont know what Im going back to."

Although El Salvador is close to my home country, Guatemala, I didnt have the opportunity to come here before that. But after my first visit, I had to come back because of my work and Ive been here ever since. Lester arrived in El Salvador in his car, with a few clothes and his computer. I thought that I would come for a couple of months and that I would live in a hotel so I didnt need much. But here I am, still here a few years after! My first impression of San Salvador was that it was a city with few buildings, not a lot of traffic, and people as lovely as the weather. Living outside my own country is an experience that has enriched me. Ive been able to meet a lot of people that have become very important in my life, and Ive been able to learn so many things that I couldnt in Guatemala. Of course I always miss my family and the food but I feel happy now because Ive made it in El Salvador. It hasnt been easy, especially because getting used to another country is a process, starting with the weather, as well as the culture and the food. I think whats important is the commitment and the desire that you may have to overcome difficult situations. Now I feel like a Salvadoran at heart.
539	Lidia	Russian Federation	Switzerland	O	E	far	10166	86919	H	im	female	"My current home is in Geneva, where I am a traveller, photographer and intern at UNFPA. I moved here from Russia at 22. Before that, my first independent international travel was to the USA at the age of 18 — I was a part of a Work & Travel programme and worked in a beachwear shop in South Carolina, struggling with my very poor English. Afterwards, I realized that I had the sense of belonging that is so present in the Russian cultural code but somehow in a different way than what was expected of me. Russian proverbs, historical anecdotes, and the current political discourse all promote the sense of belonging to your home country, region, town. For better or worse, this is not the case for me. I strongly believe that neither nationalities nor geographical borders are defining in life: what you really get attached to are the people, what you really belong to is the whole world. Thus the decision to leave the geographical borders of my country did not cost me much; when your home is the world, you never actually 'leave.' However, what I did want to leave behind were the preconceptions that many people have to live through. Preconceptions held by your close family and friends about other nations, races, religions, and sexual orientations. Preconceptions of the immigration and passport control services about you, a 'young unmarried Russian girl whos probably going to try and settle in Europe through fake marriage,' every time you apply for a visa or cross the EU border. Living in Europe allows you at least to some extent to forget about the borders – internal or external – that people build around themselves. And if you belong to the world without borders, and are attached to people without limits, somehow putting into practice the Russian proverb где родился, там и пригодился» (roughly: 'one is needed/should be useful where one was born') becomes a much more fulfilling process. Life in Geneva is a puzzle of cultures, languages, and traditions. Switzerland has 4 national languages; when I moved here in 2013, more than 40% of the population in Geneva was foreign. When I go to the closest supermarket I see passers-by in colourful ethnic African clothes, I hear students speaking in Spanish, and I notice Russian-speaking moms talking to their kids (who might actually answer in French). It is life at its fullest, and it is beautiful. Still, being a migrant is a struggle. You gain freedom, but you often lose support. Your loved ones feel that you are abandoning them, your parents are frightened that your life will never be stable, the people you knew for years suddenly feel that you do not love your country as much as you should anymore. You learn to think in a new language, play by new rules and calm down the inner voice that tells you: 'you will never be accepted here; you will always be alien; you will never belong. You begin to seek support regardless of family or national ties; if you are lucky, you find it. If not, you learn to seek support from within. In the end, it is not leaving your country that frightens; it is the possibility that one day there might not be a country you can call yours."
540	Liga	Latvia	Estonia	E	E	close	17871	23106	E	im	female	I have always thought Central Asian regions were interesting, but my interest for Kyrgyzstan was sparked during a master studies field work in Mongolia. Since I speak Russian, I had access to the region in terms of the language. I research economics development in Kyrgyzstan and my studies brought me to Tallinn. It made sense to move here, but still not be too far away from home. I have two nieces and one nephew in Latvia. I am still be able to visit them and stay close, I did not want to be the aunt whom they see only on Skype. By now the distance between Tallinn and Riga feels like nothing. Actually, it feels like two parts of the same city, it just takes time to travel from one to another. Since Estonia and Latvia are neighbouring countries, there is a lot of comparing between the two. I feel that life and people are generally quite similar. Since I cycle a lot, I was positively surprised that people, especially car owners, in Tallinn are more polite to cyclists than in Riga. Also, what I really appreciate here is that Tallinn is so much on the water and there is a lot of nature around – plenty of bird watching spots, little islands and beautiful areas for walking. I find it easy to navigate around, especially in the area where I live, life mostly goes on in Russian. Generally I would speak English to the younger and Russian to the older generation. Often I feel I need to apologize or explain why I dont speak Estonian. I think Estonia and Latvia are still quite closed, nation-dominated kind of places. Foreigners are told they need to learn the language and thus they will be integrated in the local society. Its an easy answer, but I dont really think it works this way. For integration to happen, people need to feel welcome or to be seen as having the rights to be there, without this bargaining – you learn our language, you dance our dances, then you are welcome. I enjoyed learning Estonian, but speaking a language does not define where I feel at home. I think everyone needs a deeper understanding of what it means to live in a country. I feel both Latvian and something else. I feel lucky to have the Latvian passport, as it allows me to do so much. Yet, my passport doesnt determine who I am. If I would decide to change my passport, I would not have the feeling that Im giving up my country. There is a lot of emotional attachment to stories, to songs, my life in Latvia, but I separate the emotional connection to the environment I grew up in from the connection to the state as a rational manager of people. All places change and evolve, and I have the option to react to these changes. I have always wanted to travel, live in different places, because this is the only way I can understand the scope of humanity and through that, myself.

I was enjoying my life in Ukraine and never wanted to live abroad. But then the war started in the region of Donetsk and I had to flee. I honestly never wanted to live abroad. That's why it was very hard for me. Sometimes, I'm homesick because my parents are still there. They didn't want to flee, to leave their home where they have everything. I talk to my parents over the phone, that helps a little bit with my homesickness. I came to Munich one and a half year ago. Here, I learned that there was a shortage of kindergarten teachers. By now, I am already a member of the Psychological Society. And I made preparations for the establishment of my own kindergarten, which opens in four months. I think people here are pleased with my knowledge and experience. The German society can benefit from it. It was very interesting to get to know this new culture. Germans are very well organized and always on time. They are a bit reserved, not very emotional, but they are sympathetic, helpful and friendly.Munich is a very multinational and friendly city. The residents of Munich manage to cohabitate very well with foreigners. I'm glad I live in Munich. But as soon as there is peace in Ukraine and a new government is formed, I will go back there.
542	Liliana	Romania	Libya	E	A	far	12929	4243	E	im	female	I have been in Libya since 1995. At that time people in Romania were facing many difficulties due to the economic situation, which was not good enough for me to build my dreams. I applied to an agency to work abroad and the first offer was for a job in Libya, so I came here. I was 25 years old back then. I dreamed of having my own house and improving myself. I still remember how friendly people were with us. They would bring us lots of food all the time. I really felt good from the beginning. At first, I worked in Gharyan hospital in western Libya. For the first week, the agency actually booked us a hotel and we spent some time off. They took us to see the ruins and different parts of the city. I still remember how crazy it was in Gharyan hospital. What I loved most was when I worked in the Gynaecology unit. It was a very happy moment when you helped a woman give birth and saw a baby come alive. I felt so happy, I felt very useful. Every night we dealt with 20 cases. And believe me when I say its hard work to deal with three women delivering at the same time. I remember one night, I was in the nurses room when someone came to us and said delivery on the stairs! We were running quickly and actually found the woman on the stairs. All we could do was proceed to help her. Gladly, everything went fine. That night, I will always remember. After two and half years, I moved to Tripoli. I love my job, even though now I work as a nurses supervisor. As a nurse, you need to train yourself from time to time be like doctors. This is a teaching hospital and we used to have seminars for nurses. But now everything has stopped. I still try to attend surgeries, especially the ones that take up to 7 hours. When you work as foreigner, you have to be good, this is why we are here after all. I would say everything was normal in Tripoli until 2011. For the past 7 years we have started to lack in medical supplies and you can see how much people suffer because of that. We have also been observing many more gunshot and urgent injury cases. Sometimes they call me at night, so Im on duty to help always. Now, a lot is happening outside, but what never changes is how kind people can be to you. I went on a road trip once to Leptis Magna (Roman ruins) - it was great. But that was before 2011. After that, I never went back at all. I dont spend a lot of time outside, but I love cooking. Since I have been based here, I have learned how to cook Libyan cuisine from friends. Because there are people from different nationalities working with us, I try to take the best dish from each country. Sometimes, I go to the beach in the early morning at 7 a.m. and go home when people start to come at midday. I like it more when Im alone. I also like to go to the old city of Tripoli - they have very nice handcrafts, which we get for ourselves sometimes or as gifts for friends and family. I miss family, my father and my sister. By moving to Libya, I tried to help us all and I feel like I did. I feel like I raised her, since our mother died when I was only seven years old. I built a house for her, so she can be close to our father and take care of him. I can say after 20 years: my dream came true. Thank god. I remember in 2011, during the revolution, I went to see my father in Romania. Since the airport was closed, I had to go by land to Tunisia. Along the way, I saw many beautiful houses destroyed. I dont love to see Libya this way - I feel very sad. Its home for me and I say that Im half Libyan. I wish the best for Libya - I wish all the problems were gone. My father has asked me to move back to Romania, but Im not planning to do so. I told my father, I will to go back to Romania when Libya becomes better again. When I see people happier, like when I came.

We spent much time together and fell in love, but my parents did not allow me to have a boyfriend until I turned 18 years old; we were both 14 years old. So we waited. In 1982 when I turned 18 years old, Oscar gave me a serenade at my birthday and we started dating. I was studying my psychology at the University of Costa Rica and he was finishing night school while working in the daytime painting houses. We were two young people with limited socio-economic conditions. Oscars father began to consider the possibility of migrating with his whole family for their safety. This began to weaken our relationship because the possibility of a separation was always a threat.  Oscar and his family migrated to Australia 1985 with a humanitarian visa. We were unable to continue our relationship and lost contact, despite the love we felt. In 2000, Oscar contacted me again after many years and we began talking regularly with hope of seeing each other again. This time we were in contact every day through Skype and telephone and after a few years we started to make wedding arrangements. We got married on December 25, 2013 in Costa Rica in a very intimate ceremony with family and friends. We applied for a spouse visa which was approved, and I came to live to Australia with Oscar in January 2015. We met in 1979 and 36 years later our dream of being together has finally been made possible."

One of the most common issues that women come to me with, is divorce and how to proceed with it. Many feel like they have no way out but I show them that they always have options available to them, she explains. Ive always felt a powerful need to help those who do not fully know their rights. I have often seen too many women in situations where they feel like they have no legal recourse. I try my best to help them but I dont always succeed. I remember one case that stayed with me when a woman came with her husband and two children and said that she wanted a divorce. She said that the war and the struggles of living as a refugee had completely broken down their marriage and she wanted a way out. I helped her through the process but before we could finalize things, her husband took their children and ran off somewhere. We have been unable to find them even though we are pretty sure they are still in Turkey. The case broke her heart just as much as it did mine.

Under the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration, he is being supported with a comprehensive reintegration plan, which encompasses his economic, social, and psychosocial needs. Lincoln is one of the beneficiaries who receive psychosocial support. When Lincoln came back to Ghana, he felt like he had failed and lost hope in life. He felt his family was disappointed and he felt hurt that his dad did not care. All of this, plus the traumatic experiences of a perilous journey through the desert, during which he saw people die and experienced violence first-hand, affected his mental health. Lincoln is motivated by music. Not only is he using music as a means to heal and process his experiences. He also uses it to spread important messages to his listeners. In one of his songs titled Guns from Tripoli, he narrates his migration experience. Through his creativity he becomes a safe migration advocate. My name is Lincoln Kennedy Mensah. Im from Takoradi, the Western part of Ghana. Its the capital of the Western region. I was born and bred here. I left Ghana in 2018. It was March. I had dropped out of university, so I had started recording music. But I couldnt make ends meet from recording music. All my friends that I had made growing up with were taking the same route. So, I decided ok, let me join them in Italy. I have always felt that there might be a better option outside but looking back now…. It is not easy out there. Not knowing if you are going to make it or not. Being alive is just by the grace of God. When I came back to Ghana, I felt abandoned. But then IOM called, and that give me that psychological fitness and some support that not all hope is lost. The life of an underground musician has its own challenges, including financial constraints. The support of IOM in this process has been very helpful for me to get my studio which I use to produce my music I am inspired by the musician Knaan and just like K'naan, I am a victim of irregular migration. Telling my story is not a shame at all. I have always admired him, and I know, one day, my music would hit like his. Do not go and risk your life; its not safe out there. If you want to travel, exercise a bit of patience and use the right channel."
546	Linda	Iraq	Bulgaria	M	E	far	4146	10058	E	im	female	"Linda came to Bulgaria with her family. Her husband Freddie owns a restaurant in Sofia. Linda works as a translator and is also one of the founders and chairwoman of the Council of Refugee Women in Bulgaria – a small NGO that supports refugees during their process of local integration. As a refugee you cannot get a visa and go wherever you like. We were content with the country that would give us security. The first thing I felt when I arrived in Bulgaria was peace and safety. People were so tolerant towards my family and me. People take care of each other here. I honestly really feel Bulgarian; the feeling comes from within. At the beginning when I got here I did not know any Bulgarian words, so we decided to live in a Bulgarian neighbourhood, inhabited by local people. We let the kids play with Bulgarian children and we only watched Bulgarian television. One time, when buying groceries, the cashier asked me about my kids. I told her in English: I have two children - Sandra and George. She asked in Bulgarian: Momiche i Momche? I told her: No, Sandra and George. She again said: Momiche i Momche. I asked my daughter to come translate and ask the cashier why she so badly wanted to change the names of my children. It turned out that Momiche i Momche are the Bulgarian words for girl and boy. One other thing that differentiates Bulgarians from the rest of the world is the way they nod yes and no. I wanted to go to the city centre and there were five taxis waiting in the street. I went to the first one and asked: to the centre? He nodded no. So I went and asked the second, he also nodded no. The same happened with the third and fourth. Finally the fifth driver answered in English and said yes. So I asked him: Why didnt the other drivers want to give me a ride? He answered: did they nod their head saying no? Well, that is the way we nod yes in Bulgaria."
547	Liu	China	Portugal	I	E	far	10229	22413	E	im	female	I was born in China, in a coastal city. I came to Lisbon by myself in 2002. A cousin of mine who lived in Porto had told me about Portugal. When I arrived I started working as a waitress in a Chinese restaurant. Over a few years I managed to save enough money to open my own small grocery store in the Ameixoeira neighborhood in Lisbon. I only close my shop to go to the doctor or when I need to go renew my Portuguese residence card at the Borders and Foreigners Agency (SEF). I sell vegetables and fresh fruits, as well as some other groceries.  There are also three small tables by the shops window so that customers can enjoy a cup of coffee or eat a small pastry that I made myself. One of my customers, Mrs. Leonor, loves the sweet rice (arroz doce, a typical Portuguese sweet dish) that I cook. She says that it is the same as her mothers recipe. It was my neighbor who taught me how to cook Portuguese dishes. I live and work on the same street, so I know people from this neighborhood. They are the ones who help me when I need help. Portuguese is very difficult to learn. I've taken several classes and I also use a mobile app, but I am still afraid of misunderstanding the language. I learned to drive in Portugal and I passed my theory exam right away, but I only passed my driving practice exam on the fourth time. Today I have a van that I drive to go buy products for my store at the Lisbon General Market, as well as a smaller car for my every day journeys. When I have to go to the city center I usually go by metro to avoid wasting time looking for a parking space. I have not been to China for 11 years and I mostly miss my mother, my sister and my son. In 2010 both my son and spouse came to Portugal. They stayed for one year, but they decided to go back to China because they couldn't integrate. I use my mobile phone and social media to talk to them. Even though I have been in Portugal for 15 years, I do not intend to acquire the Portuguese citizenship because I would have to renounce my Chinese citizenship making it difficult to go visit my family. When one of my relatives celebrates their birthday, I usually bake a cake and take a picture to send it to them. It is a way of shortening the distance between us and for them to know that they are always in my thoughts.
548	Lizbet de la Cruz	Peru	Belgium	L	E	far	6163	45028	H	im	female	Mi name is Lizbet, I am 28 years old and I lived in Villa el Salvador district, in Lima, for most of my life. In my country I studied French with the intention of migrating to Montreal, Canada, where my sister lives. But since I was little, I had the dream of knowing the Eiffel Tower and the Roman Colosseum, so when the opportunity to migrate to Belgium to work and improve my French came, I didnt think twice. This is how I spent the last four years of my life in Belgium. After surviving a harsh winter, I decided to study nursing in Leuven. At that time, I faced a great challenge: learning the Dutch language. To this day I am impressed to know that there are many dialects, although this is a small country. I will graduate as a nurse in June of this year. For now, I work taking care of children. But after my graduation I would like to work in a hospital, here in Belgium, and save money to buy a house, besides traveling to Peru on vacations every year, if possible. Being a migrant taught me that changing does not mean forgetting my past but improving as a person day by day without forgetting my roots.
549	Lizzie	United Kingdom	Turkey	E	M	far	40718	8538	E	im	female	I was twenty when I left England to migrate to a very conservative, small town in Turkey.  I was very lucky to see the traditional life in Turkey, something that is not seen in the large expat communities in urban Turkey.  With both learning the language and the culture, I was thrown in the deep end and I learned very quickly. I worked hard to learn the language and culture for two reasons. Firstly, as a sign of respect. Im married to a Turkish man now and I wanted to make sure I was really a part of his family.  Secondly, it is so important to integrate. How can you feel at home in a new country without knowing the language or understanding the differences of culture? The hardest thing about adjusting to life in Turkey? Its not one specific thing – it is the combination of all the little things. On their own, none of the obstacles seem like a big deal.  Balancing your new life with where you came from, as well as missing your family, friends and native culture – thats the difficult part.  When everything seems to occur at once, that is what makes it challenging. I think I was very open to most of differences of living in Turkey… until I had my child. In general, I was very happy to go along with most of the customs and cultures in my new life.  But when I had my child, I knew I wanted to raise her more like the way I was raised and that caused the first few moments of tension in my family.  The last few years since my daughter was born were harder than all the previous years because I am less willing to take advice from relatives and friends.  In-laws can sometimes be challenging even when you are both from the same country. Add another culture to the mix and it is a delicate situation to try to avoid those clashes.
550	Lois	Malaysia	United Kingdom	I	E	far	10402	40718	E	im	female	Lois was born in Malaysia, and her mother worked as a nurse. Her mother initially moved to the UK to work while Lois was a child, but soon joined her afterwards. When I was 13, I left all my friends and family in Malaysia to join my mum in the UK. It was all very strange, coming from a tropical hot country to here. I remembered the first time I saw snow that winter. I was in a Maths class and said – Oh my god! White stuff is falling from the sky! - My teacher realised that it was a big moment for me and sent me to the playground for the rest of the day to play with snow! Lois grew up in the UK and after nearly 20 years of living here, she says her home is here now. She works as a business continuity analyst in London, and is also a touch rugby player. She was selected to play in the senior womens division for England in the 2014 European Touch Championships, and her team won the gold medal. The sport has given me so many benefits. I was lucky enough to be able to represent England and I feel a responsibility to give back. She also set up the civil service touch rugby club (CSSC Touch London) which now has over 150 club members playing regularly. When you say migrant or immigrant, people usually associate it with negative connotations. This negative perspective should be changed, as every person in the UK knows an immigrant, be it their friend, neighbour, colleague, or partner. They are a rich asset to the UK and its economy, bringing a wealth of culture, knowledge and experience. It doesnt really matter where we were born or raised, everyones contributions should be as important for a country.
551	Lorik Cana	Albania	Albania	E	E	close	5181	5181	E	hc	male	Lorik Cana is a fighter. Anyone who has seen the Albanian give his all in the colours of Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille, Sunderland, Galatasaray, Lazio and now Nantes knows that the tag, which has been applied to him since his early days in the game, is hardly a cliché. The defender is never anything less than fully committed when playing for his national team either. Capped 89 times in all, the 32-year-old Albania skipper is the heartbeat of the side, and will soon be leading them out at UEFA EURO 2016, where the eastern Europeans will be making their first appearance at a major international tournament. Cana and his troops will go into battle on 11 June against Switzerland, 13 years to the very day after his international debut, which also came against the Swiss, in Geneva, a mere 60 kilometres away from where he grew up. Its a lovely quirk of fate, smiled the veteran, who spoke to FIFA.com about all the battles he has faced in life and on the pitch. A fight for survival I am from Kosovo. I left with my family in 1990, when the first war with Yugoslavia broke out. Kosovo was part of Yugoslavia at the time and like a lot of our Albanian compatriots who came from there and Macedonia, we found refuge in Switzerland and Germany. I spent ten years of my childhood in Switzerland until I left for France in 2000 to start training with PSG. His background My father was a professional footballer and he played in pretty much the same way as me. He put a lot into it and he was a real winner. He was also very hard on me when I was growing up, both on a personal level and when it came to football. He always pushed me to the very limit to succeed, because he could see that I had what it took. He instilled his values in me and taught me to never give up. My motivation to succeed was also fired by the journey my family had taken and the tough times faced by the people who stayed back home. All that has shaped the player that I am today. His career When I played for PSG reserves, I had this real desire to succeed. Antoine Kombouare was the coach at the time and he helped me overcome all the mental barriers. The war, which was just coming to an end in my home country, also spurred me on to succeed and to make it at Paris. Its a club where its always been difficult for young players from the training academy to break into the first team, which is why I always put a lot of energy and commitment into everything I did, and a lot of physicality too. Thats where I forged the image thats followed me around everywhere.
552	Loveth	Nigeria	Mali	A	A	close	2085	856	E	im	female	Nigerian Golden Girls, West Africas Minor Issue Gold is Malis top export, accounting for at least 60% of the countrys total exports in 2017 and making Mali the third gold exporter in Africa, just after South Africa and Ghana. Small-scale, informal and low-tech mining also known as artisanal mining, although largely unregulated, accounts for at least one-third of Malis total gold production. Every year, the sector which has seen an increase in activity since the start of the crisis in 2012, attracts thousands of men and boys from across the region, creating a demand for sex workers to satisfy the needs of those who spend months, sometimes years away from their spouses who stayed back home. And every year, girls and women like Loveth are trafficked from neighbouring countries primarily for prostitution and sexual slavery. In a corner of her shack made of black canvass, wood and corrugated iron, ogbonno soup, a traditional Nigerian dish simmer in a steel pot. When she does not work, Loveth likes to cook her mothers recipes. A native of Edo State in Nigeria, Loveth now lives more than 2,000 kilometers away, in Koflatiè, a shantytown located in a mining area, in Southwestern Mali. She left Nigeria in 2017 in search of a better opportunity. In Nigeria, I was approached by a woman who offered to take me to Mali. She told me I would get a job. But I did not know this is what I was getting into, Loveth explains. When I arrived in Mali, the madam [procuress] took my passport away and asked me to pay her one million CFA [USD 2,000] to get it back and the only way to pay her back was prostitution. I refused because of my son, she says. John* (name changed), Loveths one-year-old son had joined her on the dangerous journey to Mali. After some time, I couldnt pay my rent anymore. I could not travel back home. I did not have money, I did not have a passport. Thats why I gave into her pressure. What happened next, is what happened to an estimated 20,000 Nigerian girls and women in Mali according to Nigerias National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). When she exhausted her savings, Loveth had no other option than to prostitute herself to get the ransom money. I managed to pay half of the money before I escaped, she adds. Loveth did not collect her passport when she ran away from the madam. Today, she works as a waitress in a bar owned by a Nigerian survivor of human trafficking who established herself in the surroundings of Koflatiè. She hopes to return home to start over but wishes to stay in Mali for the moment. Loveth is among thousands of Nigerian girls, vulnerable to human trafficking and sexual exploitation around Malis artisanal gold mining areas. First-hand accounts from IOM staff who met them reveal that many of them are underage and were deceived into travelling to Mali either through false promises of a regular job, or the conviction that they were heading to Europe. Bondage is a common method used by traffickers to coerce their victims and exercise control over them. As in Loveths case it can be debt bondage, but it can also be the confiscation of travel documents or voodoo cursing. In this case, victims of trafficking are coerced into signing a moral contract with the traffickers who finance their journey. The contract is sealed by a spiritual priest or native doctor to whom they promise never to denounce their traffickers to the police, to obey their madam and to fully pay their debt. The victims thus live in constant fear of reprisals, including their death or that of their family, if they fail. For those arriving in Italy, their debt can reach 50,000 euros. The trend of trafficking of girls from Nigeria for sexual exploitation is captured in IOMs latest reports on human trafficking along the Central Mediterranean Route. In 2017, out of the 119,000 migrants who arrived Italy, 18,185 were Nigerian, 5 425 of which were women. IOM Italy estimates that 80% of these women were potential victims of trafficking, and that 94% from Edo State. Since 2019, to fill in the lack of data on the exploitation of migrants in mines, IOM is conducting a study on Migration Towards Artisanal Mining Sites in Mali, and in other West African countries funded by the UKs Department for International Development (DFID). The findings will help IOM better understand the migratory dynamics in relation to gold mining activities in the region and provide stakeholders with evidence-based research to inform their policies, strategies, and responses.
553	Lovísa	Iceland	Switzerland	E	E	close	63644	86919	E	im	female	"After I left Iceland at the age of 20, my first stop was London, where I went as a university student. My travels also took me to Jamaica and Indonesia before I came to Geneva, Switzerland. My first impressions were that Geneva was a very international and multi cultural city. Not too big, but not too small — with room for everyone. I've only been here for two months, so I'm still learning about the city and I'll see if or how my impressions change. What I can say is that language is definitely the biggest barrier to full integration, but with practice and patience I think I can overcome it. Missing my family and friends is a harder barrier to overcome, but I try to balance this out by remembering that for me, being a migrant means being able to move freely around the world, to work, to meet people, to open my heart and my mind. My idea of home is evolving too; it is a place where I can make a life and a living, but home is also where my family and friends are. They aren't always in the same country or city, so I guess home can be many places."
554	Lucia Kula	Angola	United Kingdom	A	E	far	1896	40718	H	im	female	I call London home now, which is quite interesting when you are rounding up 10 months in your country of birth after spending more than 22 years outside of its borders. At 8 years of age my mother, my baby sister and I fled war torn Angola in 1994. As refugees we ended up seeking asylum in the Netherlands, which was an emotional and life altering experience. The road to security and .. was not easy. It took more than 14 years for us to receive a permanent resident permit. That means 14 years of insecurity an having your life on hold, mental exhaustion and legal battles. It also meant 14 years of not knowing where home was. School was my escape. I dreamt about all the things I could do, all the places I could go and the freedom it would give me. I was always active with youth issues, migrants issues and student political activism. I organised debates and conferences, was vice president of the student union, secretary for a international youth fund, but not a resident. When that resident permit was finally issued, followed by the Dutch nationality a few years later, finally felt like I could exhale. I started doing all the other things I always wanted to do, but never could cause I wasn't allowed to travel. I participated in UN conferences and workshops on human Rights, migration, development, and security issues. It was everything I wanted and more. That more came when I received a partial scholarship in 2013 to do my masters in London, UK. I completed my masters and continued on to pursue a PhD in law. Now three years later, London is home. I miss it when I'm away, I feel comfortable and challenged to do more. The UK was the first country I had chosen myself. It was my own coming of age and leaving experiences and baggage behind. I was a free traveler, a migrant by choice now.
555	Lucica	Romania	Switzerland	E	E	close	12929	86919	H	im	female	I grew up in a small town in Romania. We did not have a lot of money but because of the educational system under the Ceaușescu regime, we could go to school and learn and build a future. But it also taught that you have to work hard to get anything, everything was so competitive, there were so many children in my generation! I decided quite early on that I wanted to become a doctor - I wanted to help my family, friends and colleagues and cure them. I eventually became a medical doctor but right after graduation, I had to take another job so I joined as a journalist, doing interviews for a glossy magazine after work to be able to survive in Romania. During my day job, in the Institute of TB and Lung Diseases in Bucharest Marius Nasta, I was doing a lot of work on TB – especially in data collection and analysis. I think we were using the data much better then than now. For this work I developed the first significant grant for TB for Romania from the Soros Foundation. And it was through this work that I began my travels and international work. I applied and got accepted to an Eastern European Fellowship on International Public Health in Washington DC. I was about to start a great adventure. The month before I left for DC, I could not sleep. I was thinking my English is so bad, how am I going to succeed? But at the same time there was no possibility to consider withdrawing. I could not disappoint my mentor Prof. Ioan Paul Stoicescu. When I arrived in US, it was a big shock, especially the way people interacted, talked or behaved. It was so different than in my country. Even the interaction between students and teachers was so different – it was very relaxed, informal and positive. I remember the shock I had when I saw this huge library of Georgetown University. In Romania, as medical students, we did not have many books to study and suddenly here I was in the US, in this huge library, full of books, videos that I did not even know existed. I spent days and nights there – I actually did not want to leave that place. And I made it. At the end of the programme in 1999, the World Health Organization Emergency Unit had an open position in an important project on tuberculosis in Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo right after the war. So I applied and was selected. I left Washington DC for Tirana, Albania. I promised myself, my family, colleagues at work and friends, that I would not stay longer than 9 months, but in fact ended up staying kind of… till now. Of course, I faced difficulties in starting and managing this huge project: young, woman, from Romania… very difficult. However, during my stay in the area, I learnt that people are beautiful in general and it's the circumstances that can make them bad. After a few years in the Balkans, I went to work in the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen where I stayed for 5 years, after which I moved to Geneva. Although I moved from country to country, I have always felt Romanian. This will always be. It's neither negative nor positive. This is who I am. I've seen so many people who would take their purses away as soon as they hear that I'm Romanian, or Ive heard people say I know Romanians, my cleaning lady is Romanian! Even now, when I travel, I worry that I will not get the visa or, if the police will check me, that I have the wrong documents, that I'm not going to be able to enter the country, that there is something wrong I did.. Not feeling accepted is a fear for so many people. We see it now in Europe where the situation is getting worse everywhere. People forget that many, many of us are actually migrants, or that our parents were migrants. And yet we forget that what's happening there, could happen to anyone. There is a lot of poverty in some of the countries that the migrants and refugees are coming to, and people are bitter. It's hard to have to welcome others when you hardly have bread for yourself. But I truly believe that if the current migration crisis in Europe is communicated better, explained – solutions will be found and people will be willing to share the little they have. I see myself as a migrant. A migrant worker. However, Romania is and will remain my country – with all the good and bad. But I also know and feel very well that I want to return, I just ask myself: when is the right moment to go back and give back to my country?

556	Lul	Somalia	Italy	A	E	far	118	31238	H	im	female	"I came to Italy 25 years ago as a refugee fleeing civil war in Somalia. Life in Italy today is utterly tough for migrants. The Italian government does not have the means to cater to our needs, unlike some European countries that provide migrants with housing and financial aid. But life was even harder back then, as migrants had fewer rights. For instance, we could not start our own business firms even if we had adequate resources to do so. I am the only one in my family who migrated to Italy, my closest relatives all live in Canada. I dont regret my choice to come here, but if I could go back, Id think twice about it and maybe join my family in Canada instead. In Italy, some people had and still have prejudice against migrants. I will always remember when my son was born. After being dismissed from the hospital, I received a letter from the municipality authority in Rome that urged me to go register my childs birth. The letter specified that I needed to bring my baby with me. It was a cold day of October; I went at 8 AM to the municipality office in the pouring rain with a one-week-old baby in my arms. Once I got there, I noticed that the other mothers in line did not take their children with them. So I asked the officers why I was the only one who had to bring my baby with me, they replied that the porter in my building said he had never seen me pregnant. I couldnt believe my ears: My son was born in an Italian hospital, and he should have received equal treatment. This was a long time ago and Im fine now. But as I get older, I wish more and more to go back home to Somalia. I want to help my country and my people. These tough experiences made me who I am today. My mission is now to help Somalis in Italy and I am proud to be the president of the Rome-based Association of Somali Migrant Women. Like many migrants, I think I brought valid advantages and assets to Italy. And still, our value to society is not openly recognized. We enrich, not burden, your society."
557	Lutrichia	Philippines	Libya	I	A	far	3299	4243	E	im	female	When I was younger, all I ever wanted was to go back home. Now, that Im older, I dont want to go home. Because I will not have a job. My two children are independent now, so my purpose is to put something aside for my old age. Its the truth and the current situation is not allowing us to do so, but we are hoping that something will come up and things will be better. When I came to Libya back in 1985, I was based in a city hospital west of Tripoli for 7 years. It was the hardest time and after that, I went home for few years. Then I came back to Benghazi, my favorite Libyan city, where I lived for 10 years. In 2005 I renewed my marriage vows with my husband in a big celebration at our house. The party lasted until almost 3 a.m. On that day, we vowed to love and hold each other, no matter the circumstances, until death do us part. I love my job, because I feel like a super woman when the patients call me sister and ask for my help. Im really sad to see the current situation in Libya. Because before I was able to help more people, but I can do less with the lack of equipment we have. The situation in general was better then and it was not so hard to raise children here. I have a boy and a girl. My boy was born here, and my girl was made in Libya but born in the Philippines. My boy is now an engineer, and my girl is a nurse - like mother like daughter. I really want to see them get married before I am dead. I want to see their children. I told them once, if you have children, you need to take care of them and to give them best they can have. It'll be important to give them something they haven't experienced before and to provide them with a good education. I dont do that much in my free time. Sometimes I like to go to the embassy when it organizes events for us. Mostly they plan sports activities. I dont play sports, because I had surgery on my arm. But I love to cheer for the teams playing and to eat! I go to the church and I pray with the others for peace in Libya. Its my second home, after all, and it offered me its best back in the day.

559	Maddalen Yarza	Spain	Honduras	E	L	far	27409	2406	L	im	female	I have been in Honduras for more than 6 years. I'm 23 years old and I'm going to be 30 years old. Since I was very young, I have always wanted to explore. At 18, I went to study in Barcelona. At that time, I was the most intrepid of the family because none of my brothers had left the city. Before finishing my university studies, I spent a summer in Colombia, where I had my first professional experience in Latin America. Later, I lived in Guatemala for a few months, where I worked with indigenous peoples. For me, I have never been very spiritual, this great experience has helped me to know a lot about the beliefs and traditions of ancestral people and how they understand the world, their world view. That's when I arrived in Honduras with a one-year contract. But from the beginning, I knew I wanted to stay longer, I bounced in many places and was looking for more stability. Listen, I am Basque pure strain and I do not know any gene in my family who is not Basque, but I feel very well in the tropics. I have a passion for this land. I never imagined being a migrant and I am one of the most privileged. Although I am well adapted, there are also conflicts resulting from cultural differences: when I drive, when I see the unfair difficulties that are subjected so many people in Honduras. But at the same time, I really like how people tell stories, heat, temperature. The tropics is health, the tropics are life. Once in Honduras, I met Gabriel, who became my life partner and, with his daughter, they became my family. The most beautiful thing that Honduras has given me is the opportunity to meet great people who are great friends, but now also, and especially to start a family. I fell in love with him and also with his granddaughter, Walkiria. She is the epicenter of our life: so beautiful, intelligent, affectionate and gentle. The first year of coexistence has brought many changes in our lives that we have gradually adapted, but the important thing is that I feel very good, completely happy. Living with a girl is a gift, a source of knowledge and wisdom. Our project is now to expand the family, a project that thrills us all three. I have been fortunate to work at different levels for children's rights and I am currently working in an international organization with municipal governments and institutions at a decentralized level, which can bring a much more immediate change in the lives of children from Honduras. What would I like to do in the future? I am a lover of planning, hence my passion for my work and my public policies, but I am also a person who lives in the present, I enjoy life in all its extent. I try to put into practice the maxim of my mother-in-law: life is today. My message to migrants, especially to Hondurans, is that you must not let your guard down. You must catch your breath, continue and fight for a better Honduras.
560	Madeleine	Chad	Chad	A	A	close	679	679	E	hc	female	"Madam Madeline Alingue is the current Minister of Touristic Development, Culture and Arts, a dynamic woman who has traveled the world and established a research center, but along the way always kept one thing; the love for her country. Daughter of a former Ambassador, the idea of traveling was not something new, which may explain her love for cultures. When she was 6-years old, her family crossed the Atlantic Ocean to live in the United States and 4 years later they moved to France. Although she easily integrated into the French lifestyle, and successfully completed her degree in Linguistics, she never felt that the country was where she would settle. After applying and receiving a scholarship to study in China, she experienced as she describes a rupture upon discovering a love for China. Although traveling required her to leave the life she knew, she wanted to discover the world. In China, she found their lifestyle ironically similar to the African culture, and she took every opportunity to discover other countries including Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Indonesia, and others. In the mid-1990s, she returned to Chad in hopes of finding employment. Yet, that plan did not work out and she decided to join her family in France. However, life pushed her to take a different turn, this time to Latin America; Bogota, Colombia with her husband, where she became a mother and created her own path. Yearning to improve her Spanish, she quickly enrolled and started to study International Relations. However, there was a major gap, as there were no courses related to her own continent of Africa; this is where the opportunity presented itself and she did not shy away. With just a few students interested in listening to her teachings about Africa, she became a professor, creating her own curriculum and eventually a research program. After 23 years of living, learning and breaking barriers in Latin America, she returned to Chad during the 2011 Libyan crisis, where she started working with IOM, aiding the return of Chadian migrants stranded in Libya. Yet, it did not take long for her to start climbing the political ladder to the point she was nominated as a representative of the permanent mission of Chad for the United Nations Security Council, the only woman on a team of 12.  We worked 24 hours, 7 days a week, she expressed reflecting on her role as the Political Coordinator for 2 years. A career that includes Director of the Cabinet adjoint, Secretary of State for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Communications, Minister of Telecommunications, Professor, humanitarian and a woman with the curiosity to discover the world, she has a unique perspective on migration; Migration is natural she expressed, It opens your mind, body, and soul. It can be a response to crisis, it allows people to overcome. Yet, her for her country is evident  We are the land of the Toumai, the cradle of humanity. Chad is a passageway, a refuge, a country of potential."
561	Madina	Kyrgyzstan	Ukraine	I	E	far	1186	3557	E	im	female	I left Kyrgyzstan for the United States when I was 14 only to get back to my homeland ten years later and find the love of my life whom I followed later to Ukraine. I am now living both in Kiev where my husband works and in the United Kingdom where I pursue my MSc degree at the University College of London. My parents decided to move to the USA to give me and my younger brother a chance for a better education and opportunities. It was tough seeing my father who was a well-respected geologist in Kyrgyzstan do menial jobs to support the family and I was not comfortable with the language in the beginning. It was also quite shocking for me to see all students scanned by detectors for illegal substances or objects at the entrance of the school in a Chicago suburb. I focused all my efforts to get enrolled in the International Baccalaureate program which paved my way to the Northwestern University in Chicago. My studies gave me an opportunity to meet other international students and to share knowledge and experiences. My best friends were from Sri Lanka and Colombia. At the time of my graduation I was invited to work in Kyrgyzstan by the dean of the Foreign Languages School of the Northwestern University who was appointed as the president of the American University in Central Asia. I took this chance to return and to re-establish the links with our family as well as to gain working experience. Since then, I have been studying international relations in London but I am using all my free time to travel to Ukraine where my second home and family are. The Ukrainians now are trying to rebuild their country and I hope to be able to help and contribute to this process.
562	Maged	Egypt	United Kingdom	A	E	far	3609	40718	H	im	male	Since the day I arrived in the UK, I have been amazed about their ability to give rather than take. I started contributing to British society by publishing an article about my home city, Alexandria, in a magazine published by the student union at my university. You can read an online version of the article from this link: http://issuu.com/mudmagazine/docs/mud_december_10_layout_1small/3 , page 33. I used to do personal coaching when I worked as an IT Service Delivery Manager for one of the largest natural gas conducting companies in Egypt, and since then I have fallen in love with coaching. In November 2010, I received a certificate in coaching from the Coaching Academy in London. Afterwards, starting from December 2010, I started volunteering as a personal coach for several charitable communities in the UK and abroad. By the 1st of May 2015, I could successfully deal with 118 cases while working for the Women Consortium UK and some other organizations abroad. When people ask me what kind of magic I use to transform negativity into positivity, I simply reply, All clients need three main things: an ear to listen to their problems, a mind to understand them, and a heart to feel their pain. To me, coaching is a way of life, and it helped me a lot in my work as an Arabic medical interpreter. I conducted hundreds of sessions as an interpreter. No matter the complexity or difficulty of an assignment, I still chose to deal with every single client uniquely. I have many recommendations from various workplaces, specifically hospitals in the UK and some Arabic embassies. One of the Egyptian leaders, Mr. Mostafa Kamel, said that Man, who lives only for his own, should never have been born! I remember this rule daily. Showing sincere empathy to needy people has helped immensely with dealing with my own issues. This rule is also reflected in my social media activity, and my friends often tell me how checking my timeline every day enriches their lives with hope and positivity! People think that contribution to society is one of many problems that immigrants in the UK have. However, from my perspective, I am absolutely positive that only a small amount of immigrants are unwilling to contribute to society. That's why I decided to participate in this campaign. It is our duty to do whatever it takes to show the government how productive we, the immigrants, can be. Moreover, there are many people who still can give more and more to make a great difference in the British Community.
563	Mahamadou	Burkina Faso	Chad	A	A	close	831	679	E	im	male	"I am Mahamadou, from the village of Ngarangou in Burkina Faso. I came to Faya in search of work, after a friend, who lied to me, said I could easily find it in Chad. I was a docker in my country when I told myself, why not try a new adventure? That is when I decided to leave for Europe. Initially, I tried going to Cameroon and after Gabon, but it was not successful. So I returned home and sold my land for 700,000 FCFA and set out for Niger to reach Libya. I spent 5 years in Libya, where I discovered hell on earth. I was tortured and I lost half of my teeth. I could no longer continue to Europe. Yet, I learned a new trade, masonry, during my time there working on construction sites. While I was working on a site, I met a Chadian who told me he had an uncle who was looking for workers to construct a villa. So along with some others, I set out for Faya. To our surprise, it was not what we hoped for; it was pure slavery and very difficult. We finished the villa, but the owner refused to pay us and said we had to build another before being paid. We informed the police, but no one helped. Faced with the situation, we knew we could not do anything and accepted it. All I want is to go back home and start a new life, even if all I have to show for this journey is a new skill, I can get my life back with that."
564	Mahitab	Egypt	Egypt	A	A	close	3609	3609	E	hc	female	I first left Egypt when I was two months old and went to Kuwait with my family. My father was posted to the Egyptian embassy there and we had moved with him. My first impression of moving to a new country was actually when I moved back to my home country. Everyone was so welcoming and warm upon arrival to my hometown. When I lived abroad I missed most from home its unique culture, but Im back to Egypt now currently working here. For me multicultural societies make everyone feel unique and so I believe I managed the mix of cultures throughout my upbringing quiet well. I consider Egypt, the UK and South Africa to be my home. I think my upbringing through mix cultures makes me bring back a unique culture to my home country. What I want to do for my country is to develop it economically, socially and politically through hard work and persistence. My mission in life is to make the world a better place one step at a time.
565	Mahmoud	Iraq	Iraq	M	M	close	4146	4146	E	hc	male	Mahmouds youth did not protect him from ISILs destructiveness. A sheepherder, he was injured while tending his flock. One day while he was taking care of his sheep, ISIL bombed a house close to where his sheep were grazing. Because of the strong explosion, the electric wires fell on me. They burned my hands and arms so badly that they had to be cut off. When I left the hospital, my family decided to flee to avoid any more of ISILs cruelty. We went to Haj Ali—my arms hurt so badly! Two days later we were transferred here to Dibaga Camp. Football is great—it doesnt matter that I dont have hands, because I wouldnt be allowed to use them anyways! So I can play without being ashamed, or feeling like I wont be as good as the other guys. When IOM psychosocial teams met Mahmoud in Dibaga, he explained that he felt his injuries would prevent him from doing normal things like playing sports with his friends. IOM teams encouraged Mahmoud to join in one of their activities—a football team. On a visit to the camp the next day, the same IOM team found Mahmoud practicing and playing, entirely un-self-consciously with his friends.
566	Mahmoud	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	male	The unbearable living situation in Syria pushed Mahmoud to flee like millions others. I left Syria in March 2014 and after a long journey through Turkey and Greece, I finally reached Germany in October 2014. I spent the first few months pondering whether I made a mistake by leaving Syria, or by not trying to stay in Turkey. I originally had another asylum procedure in Hungary, but after witnessing how refugees were treated there, staying there wasn't an option. So I decided to come to Germany despite the risk of deportation. Honestly, I did not expect the procedures to take this long but I do understand the effects of the influx of refugees throughout 2015. The situation is hard though and I left Syria 20 months ago and still haven't been able to get my life in order yet. Besides the tedious and complicated procedures, my biggest challenge was surprinsigly my own introversion. I've always been the quiet type and I usually keep to myself, but after a while I realized that I needed to start communicating more. It's still hard, of course, but through the friendships and acquaintances I have made, I found the people here to be very nice and always willing to help. Most notably is Mr. Jan, who spends his free time actively helping refugees in all sorts of ways. His help really got things going for me, and through it I got in contact with an advertising agency. They offered me an internship and now it turned into a full time job after I was successful in getting a work permit. I guess we mostly miss experiences and the people we shared them with. I have a lovely, supportive family that I miss the most. I also miss the old city of Damascus – she's got a soul of her own and owns a big part of my heart!
567	Maisam	Afghanistan	Canada	I	N	far	508	43560	H	im	male	Maisam studied to become a doctor in Afghanistan and worked as a journalist before migrating to Canada in 2009. He had been writing articles for the local online media and served as a correspondent for newspapers and magazines in the USA and Germany before leaving the country to continue his studies in Ottawa. Seven years ago I won a scholarship of the Open Society Institute to do a Masters programme in Health Communications at the University of Ottawa. I thought a lot whether to go or to stay. Our culture is very much family based and for an Afghan it is not that easy to say good-bye to the relatives and embark on a long journey. The excellent results of Maisam secured him a new PhD scholarship in 2011. However, his integration has not gone that smoothly. The cultural differences affected me overtime. Back home the society puts the group and the family before the individual. In Canada, what I found was the opposite. In Afghanistan you could always go to a place where your friends or relatives have a tea and discuss daily matters or politics. On many occasions, I initiated conversations with other people but at the end of the day I was feeling lonely because everyone was going their own direction. But the Canadians are hospitable in their own ways. They invite us for Thanksgiving and Christmas and treat us as they would treat their children. The plan of Maisam is to continue following his path in the academia. Recently, he started a research on the health systems of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. I think I gained a lot but I also lost things. I lost the close connection to my family and I missed the opportunity to become a doctor in Afghanistan. At the same time what I have gained could be applied not only in my country but in the whole world. I feel that I am becoming a global citizen. To serve the poor people wherever they are is as important to me as serving my own people in Afghanistan. My origins are there, I live in Ottawa, but the world is what I call home.
568	Majdi	Tunisia	Libya	A	A	close	3318	4243	E	im	male	At 25 I came to Libya from Tunisia. I miss my family the most, but I want to focus on the things that I have to accomplish. My goal for my time here is to strive in the healthcare insurance sector and assist people in the realm of healthcare provision. I would also like to put forth new approaches to medical care as well as insurance culture. My first impression of Libya was that Tunisians and Libyans share the same thoughts and people here make you feel like there are no borders. I would like to tell Tunisians in Libya that if you cant do anything for this country then there is no reason to be here. Those of us here need to take care not to judge the current situation, keep an open mind with regards to Libyan citizens, and to try to adapt to new circumstances.
569	Majid	Morocco	Mauritania	A	A	close	3108	1702	E	im	male	"Abdelmajid comes from Amizmiz, a small town about fifty kilometers south of Marrakech, where he is known as Majid. He has been an electrician for 15 years without ever really having thought what he should become, as he quickly learned the trade by watching his father work. When he talks about his city, and Morocco in general, his eyes sparkle and his smile widened. He misses his country, his wife and children too. He was technical manager at a hotel 400 kilometers from his home. Every 3 months, he would return to Amizmiz for a week. It was tiring but I was used to. So when I was asked to go and work in Mauritania to earn a higher salary I accepted immediately because, despite the greater distance, my future boss had assured me that I will keep the same rhythm back to house before, says Majid. Khadija, his wife, remained in Morocco with their two children. For her, Majids decision to leave was obvious; three of her brothers are in Italy, as well as her uncles and aunts. In the family, migration is almost natural. Majid went to Nouakchott 18 months ago, full of enthusiasm and dreams in his suitcase, but the promises of his generous boss quickly vanished, as did his plan to save enough money quickly to start his own business. I spent a whole year in Mauritania without being able to go home. I work seven days a week and the money I put aside, I spend it in phone cards to talk to my children every day. I do not want to lose my family,  said Majid. He lives in Nouakchott but his heart remained in Amizmiz. I had never been afraid of working with electricity but here I dont take risks because I dont want to die away from home, he said. Majid sends as much money to his wife and children as he can. His salary pays for mathematics courses for his little sister who is in high school, and it help his mother and brother. These remittances are his way of investing in his country. I want my sister to learn English, and my children to get a good education. If it works, I will have succeeded. That's Majids life. I am a father. I want nothing for myself; I do this for my children and for my country."

I was a high school student and Saeed was an engineer. There are no jobs anymore. We still went to school, but everything had changed. You know how usually they say one apple plus one apple is two apples? With ISIL it was one bullet plus two bullets, or one bomb plus two bombs. This is what they were teaching. ISIL didnt just count bullets, they used them too. They killed my uncle—one shot through the forehead. He was lucky. They used to beat people with bamboo sticks or wires. On Fridays, ISIL would go to a busy place and block each end of the street. Thats where they would hold the public executions or stonings, and everyone blockaded in the street would be forced to watch. Mosul used to be a mosaic of people, Sunnis, Shias, Orthodox, Yazidis—it didnt matter. Now we are broken fragments again, not part of a whole.
571	Makinata	Niger	Niger	A	A	close	568	568	E	hc	female	"They call me an internally displaced person. Most people here have fled Boko Haram violence, but they come from different parts of the country or even Nigeria; some are internally displaced, some refugees and others returnees. Here you can find people of all ethnicities: Peuhl, Haoussa, Berri berri, Touareg, Peuhls Mbororo. There were 250 people in my village. We used to see Boko Haram roaming around our village all the time, but they never actually came inside the village. However, because we all lived in fear that something might happen to us one day, we decided to leave. I left with my nine children and my husband and came to Diffa. When we first arrived, we got in touch with the authorities and they showed us this site where we could live. As soon as we arrived, IOM built us an emergency shelter and I couldnt have been happier with it. I have now been living here for 14 months. The hardest part about living in Diffa is that there is no work for people. There are at least 10 neighborhoods on this site so finding work for everyone is quite a challenge. Women try to fend for themselves by finding small jobs like making soap or sewing. Back home, we were all used to livestock breeding so its a big change for us. I was elected as the womens president for this site so I often organize meetings and activities for women. It can get boring at times to be in this constant state of waiting so we just talk the days away. I always try to look at the bright side, and the bright side is that all of my children are in good health and go to school. If the state told me tomorrow that I could go back, I would, but they wont because its not safe yet."
572	Mala	Australia	Germany	O	E	far	55823	45909	E	im	female	Mala is from Leeton, Australia. She chose to leave her country to follow her heart and German partner, arriving in Berlin in 2007. Mala travelled by aeroplane, and her decision to migrate was a choice made in freedom and peace in order to build a new life in Germany. Her decision to move away from her homeland was not because of any political conflict or persecution. I'm aware that I have come from one developed country to another, she said. I am blessed to have that freedom of choice and movement. In 2015 she met many newcomers arriving in Berlin from Syria and other conflict zones. Mala was able to empathise with these migrants and refugees, in that she knew what it felt like to come to a new country and not know the language or her way around. I remember those first months when I felt so scared and nervous to even ask for a postal stamp at the post office to send a letter to my mother I felt so powerless without the language - this so wasn't me at all! Mala committed to learning German over the next 18 months. It helped her to settle into Germany and gain confidence in herself, while opening the door for work opportunities in acting and filmmaking. In 2015 she was involved in a Welcome Cafe where resident Berliners, like herself, could meet with newcomers and help them integrate. We couldn't help them with their asylum papers or any other bureaucracy but we could tell them where the best coffee in town is, how to open a library card or where the nicest playgrounds for their children are, she explained. Meeting these people gave Mala the idea to co-write, co-produce and star in a short film called NO MONSTERS IN BERLIN, which gives a voice to newcomers. We wanted to make art in true collaboration with the refugee community and tell their stories with them, Mala said. The film won Best Film at the New York Short Film festival and a prize for the Diversity in Cannes Short Film Showcase, as well as being screened at the United Nations and during IOM's Global Migration Film Festival in 2017. Her co-star Samir Al Hajjar, from Syria, is one of the people she met during 2015 and who helped inspire the story of the film. They are now working on a feature-length film that will address similar themes. Actually getting to know migrants or refugees on a personal basis is key to integration, Mala concluded. I met so many people from different countries and cultures, people I would probably never have met under normal circumstances. Some of them are my dearest friends - we have far more in common than we don't. I believe compassion is the perfect antidote to our fears.
573	Malakeh	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	female	I first went to Jordan, but in Jordan we cannot all work. So my husband Mohammed decided to come to Germany to work. After 14 months, I traveled to Germany to follow my husband. That was eight weeks ago. I came here very comfortably on a plane, but only because my husband had taken the difficult route. He escaped to Turkey and from there to Greece, from Greece to France, from France to Germany. This is a very complicated way, but if I want to summarize this trip, I will say: Its over, its now our ex-life. I went to Germany because we have a very bad government in Syria. They kill every person who works against them. This was the reason to leave my country. In Syria I left everything to go to Jordan and start from zero. There I got a new job, worked at a TV channel as reporter and presenter, but my husband could not work there and had no passport. When I decided to follow him to Germany I also left my life behind in Jordan: my work, university, home, good job, and my car. I left everything in Jordan. When I came to Germany, it was not easy to start from zero again. Everything here is good, but when you had to leave your old life in your home country, it is hard. This country is doing good things for us Syrian people and we in return must be a good people also. We have to do a lot of good things in Germany and for Germany. Im here as a cook, as I had a cooking-show in Jordan. Now Im thinking to start a catering company and to teach German people how to cook Syrian food. I want to share our food and our culture with the people. The question about what I miss the most touched me inside. I miss all the streets in Syria, I miss my home, everything! Maybe I miss the jasmine roses of Syria the most and the Barada-river in Damascus and all the shops. When I was in Jordan, everything I saw was so similar to everything in Syria. But also in Germany the old cathedrals remind me of our churches in Syria. There are no words to explain how much I miss my country. It is an emotion that cannot be explained. Malakeh and her husband are planning for a future in Germany, but they miss Syria very much. Malakehs definition of home is simply Mother!.

While living in his village of Ashegashia, Boko Haram often came in small groups, persuading the locals that their purpose was to look for security personnel and that they had no intention of attacking civilians. As time went by, it became clear that the militia were intending to target the villagers, leaving Malam and others within the village with no alternative to but slowly and discreetly escape in small groups. Malam and his family made it to a border town in Cameroon, where he stayed for five months, at that time under the protection of the Cameroonian Military. While he was living there, the town was attacked by Boko Haram. Malam was yet again forced to flee to another village, losing four of his children in the chaos and then forced to return to the previous camp en-masse. Not long afterwards, they were asked where they were from. I answered them that we were Nigerian. Then one said No, you are not just Nigerians, you are Boko Haram so we will kill you. But people from there confirmed that they were not militants. The following day, they were asked to document their group. So Malam took the task of listing every single person and all 52 households from his village. Afterwards, he and his people were forced back into Nigeria. Malam was not ready to move yet; four of his children were still missing from the Boko Haram attack in Cameroon, and he still hoped to find them there. But he had no other choice but to leave. The long journey for him and his people to Maiduguri cost the lives of 10, most of whom were children who died from illnesses brought on in part by the exhaustion through having to travel such long distances on foot. Malam was finally able to reunite with three of his missing children in Maiduguri. The fourth one, his daughter, is still missing to this day, and is believed to have been captured by Boko Haram."
575	Malik	Central African Republic	Chad	A	A	close	481	679	E	im	male	"After arriving to Chad in January 2014, following the crisis in the Central African Republic, Malik, of Muslim obedience has just obtained a degree in management sciences at the private Emi-Koussi University in NDjamena. For him, after obtaining the BAC in 2013, he did not expect to leave his country in such tragic circumstances: the war. After militias invaded his neighborhood, his house being destroyed and feeling complete desolation, he knew he had to save his life at any cost, prompting him to flee. Multiple diplomatic representations began to repatriate their nationals, I went to the embassies of other nationalities, but they rejected me. I spent two days at the airport and met people who spent weeks there because it was impossible to backtrack. The day I showed up in front of the area where Chadians registered, by a miracle the interviewer observed me for a few minutes and told the others who were with him to let me go along with the other youth since there were a lot of people there. This is how I began my journey to NDjamena, Chad. Yet there were several questions bothering me, what would I do once there? Where would I sleep and eat? Once we arrived in NDjamena, we were taken to a social center where I spent three months. The number of people staying there was plethoric and one day they told us we had to leave and would be taken to the Gaoui refugee camp (northeast of NDjamena). The conditions there were difficult, ten of us sleeping under a small tent, and theft occurring often. Unable to cope with this situation, seven of my friends and I left the camp to return to the social center that had initially welcomed us, where we met a UNHCR team that registered refugees. Here again we faced another test, having to either speak the SANGO language (official language of the Central African Republic) or present papers that proved we were really Central Africans. After registration, I was taken to another social center and then to a refugee camp in Goré, in the South of Chad. Even though the atmosphere was cordial, I missed my family incredibly and learned my mother was murdered by militias, and my sister and cousin were missing, this was in 2015. Although I felt discouraged, I could not give up because I had to rebuild my life. After some time, some individuals arrived at the camp to inform us of the DAFI scholarship program for students. Previously, in Bangui I was working on my BAC and had the papers with me which I used to apply for the scholarship. There were only six places offered for more than 80 students at various levels. After several tests, I successfully passed, and enrolled at the University of Moundou with other friends in the department of Accounting and Finance. It was not easy, we were behind academically and needed to catch up with classes to prepare for exams. Despite this difficulty and the strikes that arose, I received my license in Accounting and Finance. I lived with a friend, with whom I built a very strong friendship. Unfortunately, he eventually died of illness after he decided to return to his parents at the camp in Goré for the end of year celebrations. It was a blow for me, I was demoralized. My journey continued for 4 more years, in which during this time many of us had to abandon the courses. I really needed to finish my studies and as I still benefited from this scholarship for an academic year, I enrolled at Emi-Koussi University in NDjamena through the same organization. I chose to pursue a degree in management sciences. My scholarship contract has just finished and although I applied to several companies and organizations for internships, nothing is on the horizon. The thing that really touched me was the generosity of the Chadians; in Africa, we are united and sociable. In all the centers and camps I passed through, kind-hearted people would bring us food, and even sometimes at the market traders who realized that we were refugees would give us items for free. Chad is my destiny; the events that took place in the Central African Republic caused many young people to flee to Europe, as they thought there they could do better (I cannot judge them), but I believe in Africa. It is enough that there is stability and peace as well as the creation of job opportunities to limit the drain of skills, from the able arms of Africa to Europe. I only hope to find a small job to support myself and if possible contribute my stone to the construction of Chad. I do not think Im going back to Central Africa because my own rejected me. Militias would shout in the neighborhoods go home referring to us, the Muslims. For me it is a grace to live in Chad and I will always be indebted to this country."

I am the oldest one, so I always help out with my siblings as much as I can, especially my sisters so they dont have to look to men to support them. My grandfather was a journalist so Ive always enjoyed listening to people. I was looking for a scholarship in communications and a university in Bamako offered me one. I cried on my way there not knowing what to expect. I got off the train and looked around and wondered what was going to become of me in a country where I had no family, friends or support of any kind. I found a house with four other female students, and I paid for the advance for us all. They gave us the key, and we then soon realized we had no water or electricity. We went to complain to the agency and they told us the guy we gave the money to didnt even work there! Desperate and homeless, I had to call my grandpa at 5 am and tell him what had happened. I couldnt even afford textbooks. I was always saving and sending my family money so my mum could get proper treatment for her cancer. I never asked anyone for anything. As a young woman in a foreign country, I struggled, but I managed to survive. I felt welcomed in Mali and the people I got along with best were locals, but I didnt make a lot of friends because I was so focused on doing well in school. I couldnt let my family down; they were all counting on me. I had to fight hard to finish my studies. After I graduated, I applied for civil services. I cried for days when I found out they were sending me to Agadez. I told my employer that I was young and willing to learn so he advised me to send out my CV. Ive always wanted to work in the humanitarian field so I was happy when I heard I had been recruited as an IOM community mobilizers and then within the protection unit. I like working with migrants - every day I learn something new from them. Nowadays, you can see more women in positions of power in Niger. Women have become more emancipated and are looking for things other than marriage. People are different – not all women have the same goals or ambitions, and we need to respect that. In my senior year of highschool, there was a man who wanted to marry me, but my grandfather fortunately refused. He said I needed to finish my studies, maybe to even do a PHD, that learning never ends. He always used to say: A man can cheat on you, a diploma never will."

She is a trained designer and restaurateur, married and mother of 2 who has lived in Chad for 27 years. She arrived in Chad in the early 90s initially for a family visit as her niece is half Chadian, yet she also discovered the country and its economic potential for the restaurant business , something she could easily do after having lived for more than 15 years in France and where she learned an immense about the sector. After her family visit, which lasted only a few weeks, she went back to Cameroon and then returned later to settle down and start her business with the support of her husband. What comes to mind when she hears the word migration? She responds : the desire to go to Europe in the quest for well-being, regardless of the sacrifices that must be made. But the West is not an Eldorado, she adds. For having lived over a decade in Europe, Mama Jackie says that you can live better in Africa. One can undertake in ones country with the limited means at ones disposal. Although it is difficult, sometimes with the energy problems that arise and sometimes impact her activities, she expressed that only perseverance and a job well done pays off. Africa is rich, its culture even richer and her restaurant is a crossroads of different African cuisines. At the restaurant La Tortue, she employs more than 5 young people who work among others, as servers and cooks, and from time to time, she shares her experience, giving small trainings to youth who wish to pursue a career in the restaurant sector.
578	Mamadou	Guinea	Niger	A	A	close	1179	568	E	im	male	A Young Adventurer Drives Home Message About Irregular Migration Meet Mamadou, a returnee from Guinea-Conakry We met Mamadou, 23, last year at IOMs transit centre in Niger. Exhausted and traumatized after his journey, Mamadou couldnt wait to go back to Guinea-Conakry and reunite with his mother. He felt like a disappointment and an embarrassment to her. Mamadou left his home in 2016 headed for France, where he hoped to continue his studies in marketing. He had seen his friends make it abroad so he thought he could as well. Somewhere along the route, he realized that it wasnt as easy as he had imagined. Too many people lose their lives in the desert. There is nothing to eat or drink its a disaster, he recalls. He had made it all the way to Arlit in northern Niger when he decided to get in touch with IOM and go back home. Since I left, I knew about IOM. I watch the news, Im on Facebook I knew who to call if I was ever in trouble. Once back, Mamadou signed up for one of the joint EU-IOM reintegration projects aimed at providing income-generating activities for returning migrants from Niger and local community members. He is excited to be part of this project, and sees his migration days as a young adventurer as a life lesson. I am completely invested in this project and I want to make it work. Having heard the stories of abuse his fellow migrants at the centre endured, he is thankful for getting out of this experience unharmed, and for finally having something to look forward to. All migrants assisted by IOM with voluntary return from Niger are eligible for the EU-IOM reintegration programme funded by the European Union. Twenty micro-projects have been set up so far in Guinea-Conakry, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali for close to 6,000 beneficiaries. The projects help returnees rebuild their social, professional and personal networks that they may have lost during their migratory journeys, but also support community members in countries of origin to prevent future risky departures and to strengthen the community development mechanisms.
579	Manolo	Colombia	Germany	L	E	far	5333	45909	H	im	male	I'm from Colombia, I'm 27 years old and I'm studying Public Policy at the Hertie School of Governance. I've lived in Germany now for almost two years. I can still recall the day I left Colombia. It was the first time I would be traveling to Europe and the first time I would be traveling without my family. It was a wild jumble of emotions. With 12 hours, it was also my longest flight up to now. When I left the airplane, I was mostly surprised that the Berlin airport was nothing special, nothing I hadn't already seen in Colombia. Also, the Internet is worse here than in Colombia. The first thing I ate here in Germany was a Kebab. I only realized the next day that I was actually in Germany and that my dream, for which I had worked for so long, had finally come true. My time here feels like a ride on a roller coaster. Sometimes I feel 'On Top of The World', and in the next moment, it's incredibly hard again to be so far away from my father, my mother and my sister. It wasn't easy to come here. I had to give up a lot. But I knew I had to do it. Not only because of my studies, but especially in order to find myself. I'm a big fan of history – and I love military courts. I remember watching movies about the World Wars as a kid and being fascinated with Germany's ability to always get up again and come back stronger. Berlin and I just worked immediately. It unites the best things from Germany and the best things from all over the world in one place. Dirty and clean, order and chaos, German and Internationality. It's a very fragile, but beautiful balance. In Germany, especially at my university, I was surrounded by people who were incredibly good at what they were doing. This experience humbles you because you learn to learn from other people. And I realized that I had a long way to go in order to be better. Not only on a professional or academic level. I want to be a better person, a better man, a better friend, a better son and a better brother.
580	Manuel	Germany	Philippines	E	I	far	45909	3299	L	im	male	I was born in Germany in 1983 and have lived in the Philippines for more than seven years. I left Germany when I was 26, after finishing my graduate studies in international relations in Berlin. When I first came to the Philippines in 2009, I had no idea that I would still be here now. Back then, I was mostly seeking an experience that would expand my somewhat limited, Eurocentric and overly comfortable worldview (Weltanschauung). I had studied peace and conflict, particularly in Asian contexts, in my graduate program but became frustrated with the self-referential nature of the academic discourse. The Philippines seemed like a good place to start getting some much needed experience outside of my comfort zone. My first impression was the immense wall of humid heat that hit me once I stepped out of the airport. Id never experienced anything like it, and it was winter in Germany when I arrived in the Philippines. I felt immobilized and comforted at the same time. Shortly after that, my next impression was the hospitality and warmth of Filipinos, embodied in my then co-worker who welcomed me to the country like a mother would her long-lost son on our first meeting. I worked in peacebuilding projects on the southern island Mindanao for several years. One thing that always struck me is how vast the potential, the richness of ideas and initiatives for people to build a better future in this country is. But often, these ideas dont come to life for lack of support, networks, and sometimes critical reflection. This is where 'outsider-insiders' like myself can make important contributions. After several years of work in the peace and development sector, I decided to pursue a long-term passion and started working as a filmmaker. In my work as a filmmaker, I seek to surface non-conventional stories and narratives of people who often get overlooked in the mass media discourse. Again, my perspective as someone who is somewhat, but not quite, part of the country can help zero in on such particular human experiences. It seems to me that these days, some people in Germany, Europe and the Western world are fighting a losing battle to retain the privilege that has been forcefully obtained over the last centuries, with the consequences including exclusionist policies, growing xenophobia and bigotry. This is where I believe exchanges of personal stories and experiences across continents can help to move the discourse in a less exclusionist direction. I do miss a few things from Germany: family and friendships, efficient public transportation, the sense of a country having somewhat come to terms with its history. But when I think about home these days, my biggest hope is that Germans dont give in to fearmongering and bigotry. The world is a messy place, but building walls to keep it outside wont help. It didnt help in Berlin either.
581	Marc	Spain	France	E	E	close	27409	38959	E	im	male	Migration means several things to me: challenge, adventure, loneliness, friendship, nostalgia, discovery and solidarity. I am discovering all of these things as a communications officer in Paris, where I moved from London after having completed a masters in multimedia journalism. I left Barcelona, my hometown, looking for job opportunities, academic goals and personal experience, and though I might not have gone so far away, I am still a migrant. I try to always remember how privileged I am for enjoying this time of my youth in such great cities, but still, I can't help feeling the wounds of the distance. Therefore, it's important for me to stand by other migrants, especially those whose situations are more difficult and complicated than mine. I try to do this every now and then by participating in equality demonstrations, writing articles in support of the cause and helping at food banks. Empathy is the most important quality. We all have to try and understand why people leave their countries and lives behind. My advice to someone living in a country that hosts migrants is to put yourself in their shoes, think about your own children, and keep in mind that even a small action from yourself could make the difference. Take nothing for granted, talk to migrants, help them build a warm home and be part of the community. People can make things better for new arrivals by staging protests on the streets and challenging authorities and traditional political parties by forcing them to apply new, welcoming policies.   For those who leave their homes to go elsewhere, I would say: do not hesitate to ask for help, most locals will welcome you wherever you go, but be weary of headlines and first impressions. Integration takes time, but once you achieve it in your own way, it can be a source of freedom, cooperation and relief.
582	Marcello	Italy	Switzerland	E	E	close	31238	86919	E	im	male	One night, while I was preparing for an exam at school, I heard on the radio Beethovens concert for violin in D major. I got so touched, I decided that violin should be part of my life. I left my home town, Salerno, in the south of Italy when I was 25, with my violin case and luggage to finish my studies in physics in Genova, in northern Italy. Soon afterwards I started working there as a researcher. I then moved to France and after a short while, to Switzerland, to work in CERN as an applied physicist. I took a break from CERN and settled in Spain - always with my violin - to work on a nuclear fusion project for almost six years. I came back to Geneva in 2013, and found out about the UN Orchestra. Im glad I had classical music in my life to guide me when I was away from home all these years. Even though I was new in a country, playing music opened new perspectives, helped me meet new people. I realized that it helps me and others to share a common language with the rest of humankind. I feel that music makes the world better. The UN Orchestra is the right fit for me: we are committed, we are dedicated, we get inspired by all these virtuosos playing with us every year. We are multicultural.This is extremely enriching.
583	Mare	Estonia	Australia	E	O	far	23106	55823	E	im	male	"I had a plan to visit Australia already five years ago. I imagined this trip as a great holiday – hang out on the beach and maybe doing a little bit of work. Back then I had to postpone my plans, but few years later I received an opportunity to start studying in Sydney. Now I have been here almost a year, but I have to admit that it has been quite different from what I expected. Initially I didnt like Sydney at all. It was very crowded and tiring. Also, it was summer and the heat was intolerable. For me +30 C is too much, how about +42 C? When I first arrived, I spent most of the time looking for work and a place to live. After a while I found a job in hospitality, but I soon realized that many businesses in this sector are hugely profit-oriented. Workers are often underpaid and have to work long hours and are allowed short breaks only. It was very tricky to combine time between work and my studies due to constantly changing work schedule. I never knew whether I would have enough shifts for next week − this kind of instability made be very anxious. It took a long time before things started to look better. I found a good job and most importantly I was doing really well at my course. I also took more time to discover the city. On weekends I went hiking in the nature. I actually think that Sydney is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. However; you need to take time to enjoy what it has to offer – coastal walks, fabulous views, beaches. There are people living here from all over the world and this makes Sydney culturally very diverse. I have not felt any negative attitude towards me. It is a very welcoming environment. At the beginning there were many ups and downs, but now I wont mind staying in Sydney for a few more years. I feel I have finally adjusted to the busy lifestyle. In long term I still plan to return to Estonia as I miss my friends and family. Also I have learned to appreciate more the relaxed environment back home."

585	Maria	Russian Federation	Germany	O	E	far	10166	45909	E	im	female	Life in Chelyabinsk, a city with over a million inhabitants in Russia, was nice but boring. I studied German language and literature and received a bachelor's degree. I came here two years ago to do a master in German language and literature. In addition to my studies, I work in the office of a German company for up to 80 hours a month in order to finance my stay here. I also work as a babysitter in the evenings and on the weekends. In Russia, there is a lot more supervision in the workplace. In fact, people only work because they know they are supervised. If there were no supervision, nobody would work. In Germany, there is no need for that much supervision, the employees themselves take on more personal responsibility. Another difference between the two countries is that women here pay almost no attention to clothing. It's completely different in Russia, there, you are scrutinized and your clothing and your make-up is judged. That was uncomfortable for me. Here, it's much more relaxed. Many people here are pretty withdrawn and uncommunicative, they work, they live alone and there is nothing else. In my country, people are more open. When I visit Russia, people want to know how the political situation is portrayed and perceived in Germany. I think there are great differences in this respect. My girlfriends in Russia don't envy me being here. They are patriots and are happy to stay where they are. The relationship between man and woman is also different here. German men give their partners more freedom. I really appreciate that. When Russian men have a girlfriend, they are more jealous, they forbid them a lot of things and restrict them more. The jokes in Germany are much more superficial. In Russia, the jokes or stories are much more intellectual, you have to think about them.
586	Maria	Spain	Peru	E	L	far	27409	6163	E	im	female	I'm from Catalonia, and I left my country to learn English and look for a job. Now I live in Perú, after having lived in the UK for two years and a half where, among others, I started studying for a Masters degree at the University of Sussex and worked in different coffee shops. Along the way, this journey has meant changes, effort, new people, rebuilding my life in some aspects and supporting others — I think this is what migration means. Most of my friends were migrants like me (some were also from Catalonia) and we were a big family in London before I moved for my studies, so I would say that I have supported migrants by strengthening ties, but I haven't collaborated with any NGO or activism for migrants solidarity. During my Masters, I took a module about Transnationalism, Diaspora and Migrant's Lives, and did research for an academic essay about welcoming refugee movements in my own country. I hope to apply this knowledge in my future activities and work. In the meantime, I can speak to other migrants from experience. If you seek out positivity, you will find better experiences than what you were looking for at the beginning. Integration means going to a new country and feeling included: understanding the culture of this new home, learning the language and traditions without losing your own. Integration is not the imposition of rules, but understanding that we are all different and debating what is the best way to live TOGETHER, mixed, not merely in the same physical place. Look for people who love you for who you are and not for what you have. And love as much as you can every single day! I've seen so many people just looking for money and they are neither happy nor useful to the development of society. A few words for those from the host county: if migrants come to your country because they have to, it is likely that they had a hard life before and moving is probably the last option that they had to survive. Try to be sympathetic and understand that not everyone is as lucky as you are. Value your good fortune and help them to build their new life in your community. No one deserves to feel alone or lost. Unfairness and prejudices are what build insecurity. If migrants are in your country by choice, this means that they will probably love your home if they find people that accept them as they are. Let them feel at home, and they will learn new ways to look at the world and your culture. Living together means understanding our differences and learning from diversity.
587	Maria Magdala	Brazil	Portugal	L	E	far	6797	22413	E	im	female	"I arrived in Portugal in 2007, after having studied in Spain for a while. I always wanted to leave Brazil because I wanted to get to know other lives, cultures and worlds. I was not exactly sure where to go and I think destiny paved my way to Lisbon. I came because my sons father was working in Portugal, so we joined him. The most difficult part is getting homesick and missing my family who stayed in Brazil – the rest is less difficult to be away from. I like popular Brazilian music and I would not be able to live without it; thankfully it is easy to access it here, as well as Brazilian literature. I read Brazilian authors and poets daily. I only miss being close to my family. In Portugal I have my son, but no one else decided to join me in Lisbon. I was always passionate about colonial architecture and Little Lisbon in Brazil; I used to imagine Portugal based on these buildings and the poets such as Fernando Pessoa and Florbela Espanca. I knew very little about social or economic issues before coming. I feel that I have been privileged since I moved to Lisbon. I live in a very typical Lisbon neighborhood at the heart of the cosmopolitan city. I am close to the post office, public transport lines, schools, markets and shops. It is the Lisbon I always dreamt of, a peaceful Lisbon, in which I can calmly go for a stroll in the city – something I could not do back in Brazil. Still, it is necessary to recognize the xenophobia that we have in ourselves. Only then will we be able to deconstruct and destroy it. It is important to understand what the xenophobic spirit is and how it is harmful. A xenophobic person wont treat others equally and in a humane way, but rather as though they belong to a second-class type of citizenship. It is important to look at people as complete citizens, regardless of their nationality, race, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity or social status. It is usually migrants in vulnerable situations who suffer from the discourse that justifies xenophobia as a protective measure for a country. That is where danger and hatred stems from. Discrimination triggers a common feeling that all people have to include themselves in the same framework: 'I need to study at University otherwise I will be judged as inferior. I need to work twice as much to prove that I deserve the same as others.' Society should accept others as equal. I feel this as the director of an active association. I am a migrant and the champion of a cause and I speak with everyone as an equal. People look at me, they know my name, and they know I am the president of an association, but when they hear me talk with my Brazilian accent, they say that they never imagined that I would be Brazilian. In people's minds I would look like a Portuguese man, sometimes a Spanish woman. Never a Brazilian woman."
588	Mariam	Gambia	Gambia	A	A	close	757	757	E	hc	female	I was born and grew up in Nigeria but I left when I was 18 years old to live with my fathers family in The Gambia. There, I met a nice guy whom I fell in love with, Lamin, and soon after we got married. We dreamt of living together but we could not find good jobs. One day a friend of Lamin's told him about some job opportunities in Italy. Lamin left but I didnt hear from him for a long time until one day he contacted me from Libya. He had tried to cross the sea to get to Italy but didnt succeed and went back to Libya. I missed him so I decided to join him there to be with him. The journey through the desert was horrible, I saw people die along the way and I was afraid I wouldnt make it through but, thanks to God, I managed to reach Libya. I was happy because I was reunited with my husband but life there was not as I expected. We were constantly scared of going out as we were seeing terrible things every day. One night we managed to get on a boat to cross the sea but we did not get very far on the high sea because the Libyan coast guards found us. They took us back to Libya and they threw us in jail. They separated me from my husband. We slept on the floor with almost no food. I was thinking about our life back in The Gambia, where, even if we did not have much we were happy and we could live freely. After a month in prison, I couldnt bear it anymore. When IOM staff visited the prison, they provided us with food and blankets and they told us about the possibility of going back to The Gambia and about the reintegration programmes. I managed to get in touch with Lamin and we both agreed we wanted to go back home, so we voluntarily signed up for the return flight and came back. I am so happy to be back and I think we can have a good life here. With the help of IOM, Lamin could start a small business and I hope I can go back to school to become a nurse, like my mum.
589	Mariam	Sierra Leone	Mauritania	A	A	close	475	1702	E	im	female	"Happy and safe: Mariam Fights for her Future Back Home in Sierra Leone Following the death of her father, Mariam was forced into an arranged marriage at just 16 years old. Soon after she left her country, Sierra Leone, to follow her husband who wanted to go to Mauritania. When I left home, newly married, I was only a child who was afraid, Mariam recounted. Now 32 years old, she has spent most of her life away from home. Her husband left her and their two daughters behind and went to Europe, seeing no other solution to support their family after several difficult years. Mariam hasnt heard from him since. Alone, in a foreign country and without a proper support system, she has raised her daughters with dignity thanks to her incredible strength of character. She used to sell Bissap (a sweet drink made from hibiscus plant leaves) on the beach in Mauritania to make ends meet; determined and combative, she always found a solution to feed her children and take care of them. Nevertheless, circumstances eventually forced her to consider returning home. I arrived in Mauritania with all my papers in order. Unfortunately one day, I lost my identity card and I did not have enough money to have it redone, so I became irregular. I lived in worry, I was afraid to meet the police, I was afraid of being harassed, I was afraid for my daughters. Mariam explained. Her children have not been educated because they do not have birth certificates or identity cards either. They have never been registered in the Mauritanian National Civil Status System. Now, in Sierra Leone, I am free. I can walk in the street without fear, no one can stop or expel me, I am at home and my daughters have a status. Mariam benefited from the IOM-funded reintegration programme funded by the European Union. She can now provide for her two daughters thanks to the public transport activity she has developed in Sierra Leone. With reintegration support, she was able to invest in two motorcycles, one that she uses to operate a taxi business. Thanks to the money she earns through this business, her children go to school, eat every day, and live in a healthy environment. Being back home has allowed her to reminisce on the opportunities she didnt have when she was younger, and to plan so that her children have more options- Nobody could pay my school fees, I did not really go to school. For me it is very important that my daughters can have access to an education, Mariam explained. Mariam is proud to have always stayed true to her values, ​​and proud of her strength as single mother and woman entrepreneur. For her, the role and place of women in society are very important. I cannot help but be afraid for the future of my daughters. I want them to succeed and their lives to be [easier] than mine. She wants her daughters to have the choice to marry or not, but if they choose to she wants them to marry people that they love. She wants them to be happy and, above all, safe. Mariam herself has many abilities — through she was not formally educated, she speaks several languages ​​fluently. Id like to know how to read and write, its my dream. Sometimes Im lost, I do not know how things work but Im strong, I fight. I had a lot of hard times but when I stand in front of my mirror I have to be a proud woman and show it to my children, she added. I did not fall into smuggling networks, nobody used me for money. I have been [propositioned] many times by men but I always refused because I knew that my destiny was to use my ideas, my brain and my strength of character to get money, not my body, she continued. As she points out, many women face this kind of scenario, and sometimes they are strongly advised to leave home in search of work, but what really awaits them are the pitfalls of human trafficking. She recalls the memory of her fathers words that taught her to never agree to use her body to survive, to always respect herself and to use her intellectual abilities to develop projects. Its my turn to convey this message now. As a human being we have rights, I know it even if I have not been to school, I know I have the right to say no, Mariam concluded. After having lived abroad for a long time, many returnees testify to the difficulty of reintegrating into their country of origin. Mariams once familiar references have evolved, but she has gradually regained a place in a society. Now I am rebuilding myself, I have a family here in Sierra Leone. I have support, we stand together, she said proudly. Drawing from the lessons of her migratory experience, Mariam is now raising awareness in her community: I tell my story to everyone, every day, and I inform people. I [also] hear a lot of stories [from others] about migration, the money it takes to leave; huge sums that could be invested here in our country."

I'm based in Geneva, where I work as a beauty consultant while also studying French. Before coming here I lived in the USA, which is the first place I went to after leaving Colombia at 21. Originally, I moved because of insecurity and a lack of oportunities back home. My first impressions were that people in America were respecful; it was easy to find a job, open a bank account, get an ID. But I think with Trump's ideas things have changed, and now people don't have to be respectful towards others. Now that I am in Switzerland, I view my presence here as an opportunity to bring my knowledge and share my points of view in this new setting. To me, being a migrant means doing whatever you have to do in order to follow your dreams, and that is what I am doing now. There are often obstacles to overcome, including racism and negative stereotypes. But I think it's worth it to do anything you must to follow your heart. Those in the host country can play their part too: please smile and make an effort to help others, a tiny gesture can mean the world for the others! I miss Colombia sometimes, especially my family, the food and the weather. I set up an Instagram business distributing handicrafts from home, which is one way I maintain a link to my country. But in truth home means happiness and peace, my perfect space. This is something I can find anywhere."
591	Mariana	Ukraine	Thailand	E	I	far	3557	7189	E	im	female	I was born and raised in Kharkiv, in Eastern Ukraine, but left home when I was 15 to study in Kyiv. My parents friends suggested I lived with them during my studies so it would be easier for me. It was hard for my parents to let go. When I entered high school, I found it very challenging. Up to that point I had only been speaking Russian in Eastern Ukraine and only learned Ukrainian in school as a second language. My classmates saw me as a stranger who was only studying and lacking a social life. By the second year, I started being part of the drama club which brought me closer to my schoolmates. Before I went to law school, I started volunteering for a human rights organization which was a very different sphere to me. After I graduated from school, I moved from printing to translating to participating in trainings, until I became a consultant for the organizations hotline. I would consult people on safe migration, trafficking risks and more. This was when I decided to switch to human rights instead of pursuing commercial law. In 2013 I realized that I was stuck in a rut. I had reached my peak in the organization and there was no more room for growth, and that is when I got offered a position in Thailand. My father was very against it since he wanted me to pursue my PhD and thought that if I moved, I would never have a family. At that time, there were a lot of political shifts happening in Ukraine so my father changed his mind and gave me his blessing to move abroad. When I left, I didnt even know if I could ever work in human rights again in Ukraine. I am Ukrainian, but I am a citizen of the world. Home is wherever I feel comfortable and what makes me feel this way are the people around me, people with whom you can share your joy and sadness. What I do miss though is the physical aspects, like being able to hug my parents. However, I dont see myself settling in Ukraine any time soon. I have a big sense of justice so I would be constantly struggling with the politics there if I ever wanted to work back home again. When I was working over 10 hours a day in Ukraine, I kept thinking that my one true goal in life was to serve and enhance society. Since I arrived in Thailand, I have definitely reached the conclusion that having a career shouldnt prevent women from starting a family. I think one of the things that changed when I moved here was realizing what I want.

When I first came to Libya in 1996 there was still an air embargo on the country - so we flew to Egypt and came by land. I still remember feeling so cold, as the weather was different. It was my first time seeing the desert. I could also see the cultural differences. My father used to work in Dubai, but he never told me about this. I started to wonder – why are things like this, why are things like that? When I started the job I felt right at home, since most of the staff members were from the Philippines. Before, I didnt like the Libyan cuisine. I couldnt eat the Libyan pasta or couscous. They give us tickets at the hospital to have our meals from the cafeteria – a big meal with chicken. I used to leave the food as it was too spicy for me - I even lost weight back then. But in the long run, I learned to like it. Couscous its now my favorite Libyan food, as long as it's not very spicy. I also got married. My husband is from Palestine. We had a small celebration with close friends. Its hard to marry someone who is not from your culture. We have had to agree on the idea that Im not like this and he is not like that so we can meet in the middle. I respect him for who he is and he respects me for who am I. We are counting the years, as next November will mark 18 years of marriage. We have five boys. We kept trying to have a girl, that's why we have five kids now. I have worked in the oncology unit since 2003. I just try to explain to patients what the side effects of chemotherapy can be. So I tell them – you are going to vomit and lose your hair. What Im giving you is going to destroy your normal cells and you will become weak. Then I give them the reassurance – dont worry your hair will grow back after and it might be even more beautiful than before. You have to eat good food so you will gain power to help yourself. Now Im trying to learn more about the techniques to better administer chemotherapy, like how to help patients vomit less and have less side effects. I feel like my knowledge is improving by researching. Nowadays, most of the medicines for chemotherapy are not available to find for donations but when we cant find them, we ask patients to pay for themselves. Just like in the Philippines, chemotherapy is expensive. Now, everything is hard in Libya since its hard to get money from the bank. Sometimes patients donate to one another by keeping any extra medicine from their session. We try to collect enough for the ones who cant not afford it. I started to read books about Arab culture and as the years passed I learned to adopt it and respect it. I love Libya, as this is my home now.
593	Marie	Congo	Kuwait	A	M	far	1830	24809	H	im	female	My recruitment agent in Congo said that I would work in a hospital in Malaysia as a translator. Just before I traveled, I was told I would go to Kuwait instead. I had paid so much money that I had no other choice but to come. When I arrived, my passport was taken by some people and I was taken to the agency. I could not understand what was going on. The recruitment agent laughed at me when I told her I was here to be a translator. The family I was working for didnt understand why I had paid money to come when they had already paid for me. It turns out that the traffickers charged me and my Kuwaiti family to come. One day, I ran away from the agency, I went to different embassies, but no one could help me. I lived on the street for days. I will never forget what I went through. Finally I was able to make it to the Senegalese embassy, and they brought me to a shelter. I can tell you one thing: You would never imagine, when youre listening to people you trust and who are telling you about the possibility of a better life abroad, that it will be a nightmare.     Mary was able to seek assistance and reside in a shelter run by the Government of Kuwait.
594	Marie	France	Cambodia	E	I	far	38959	1513	L	im	female	I have been living and working abroad since I graduated from university ten years ago, and I don't think I could ever adopt another lifestyle. It is so enriching, personally and professionally, to interact with people from different cultures every day, to speak languages other than my own and to be challenged in my beliefs. Currently, I work to facilitate safe migration in Cambodia and I love what I do. I am taking part in the EU Aid Volunteer initiative, so I was trained and certified by the European Union to support humanitarian aid projects and to reinforce the capacity and resilience of communities. I was also lucky enough to be selected by an Italian NGO Gruppo di Volontariato Civile (GVC) to support their activities in Cambodia. GVC works in Cambodia to protect migrants' rights and to promote safe migration practices in vulnerable communities. It is one of the very few NGOs fighting against labour exploitation and human trafficking in Cambodia to be actively present in the field, and I am very proud to be taking part in their activities. Today, one million Cambodian migrants live in Thailand and most of them are undocumented. They work in farms, plastic factories, seafood companies or construction companies in extreme conditions, and sometimes through abuse or exploitation by their employers. For many of them, migration is not a choice but rather the only option they have to sustain their families. Surprisingly, there are as many women workers as men, especially in the construction sector. Women often make the difficult choice to leave their children behind, so grandparents back in the communities of origina take care of up to five grandchildren with no financial or social support. As a woman and as a migrant myself, these stories touch me profoundly. I wish we lived in a world where migration was a free choice, not a necessity, and that everybody would know what equality and dignity mean.
595	Marie	Germany	United Kingdom	E	E	close	45909	40718	E	im	female	Five years ago, I moved to London to study at the Royal College of Music. I graduated there in 2014, went on to do my Master at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and now I am celebrating the fact that besides being an exciting and historical city, London represents a wonderful mix of people and cultures making it all the more enjoyable to be a freelance musician. I am celebrating that I am meeting new people every day, and that I can work with artists from various countries. I am celebrating that everyone can contribute something different to the music we are making and the art we are creating, because they have been brought up in different cultures, with different traditions and views. I am celebrating that London is a place that connects people from all over the world, and a forum which allows us to get to know our fellow human beings. Most people want to go to another country for their holidays. Not only because we are seeking the sun and the sea, but also because we want to see more of the world than just the place in which we grew up. Why would anyone not want to embrace the fact that, in this day and age, connecting the world is so much easier? Everyone has different beliefs of human history and what will happen after we die. Nobody knows any of that for sure. But what we know for sure is that we live on this planet right now. And to make the most out of it, we should try to explore as much of it as possible. In nature and in humankind.
596	Marie	Chad	Cameroon	A	A	close	679	1502	E	im	female	My name is Marie, a young Chadian originally from the department of la Kabbia, in Mayo-Kebbi Est. I am a student at the University in Ngaoundéré, Cameroon in the department of Law and a member of the national womens football team, Sao of Chad. When I arrived to Ngaoundéré, everything seemed complicated and it was very hard for me to integrate into the new society. It rained all the time in Cameroon, and if it was not for the fact that there were many ongoing strikes in the Universities in Chad, I would not have gone there to study. Yet, I persevered for a few more months and eventually integrating became easier. I began to realize that I had the opportunity to discover a new country, a new city, and even new people, an experience that would be priceless for my personal development. I can say that today, thanks to my experience as a migrant, being a student studying in Cameroon, I have learned so many things, and built many new friendships.
597	Mariia	Russian Federation	Switzerland	O	E	far	10166	86919	H	im	female	"My first experience of migration came at 20, when I left Russia to go live in Brazil. I went there as a student and I was immediately charmed by the place. I wouldn't say that my impressions of Brazil have changed, although I did have to get past a few challenges when I first got there, but it will stay in my heart as a very important place. I moved yet again to come to Geneva, Switzerland where I study and I work as a middle office manager for a bank. Once again there were some hurdles to overcome; in addition to my family and friends, I also miss the right to work full time in Switzerland. Being a migrant means learning to be more organized, more persistant and in some cases stronger than everyone else. Finding a place to live was more difficult than I anticipated. It was also a big challenge to find work. I love the country and respect its people — I understand their desire to protect work places for their citizens first — but I think it might be refreshing if they could be a little bit more open to the migrant workforce. It's still a fight to get a work permit, but I'm confident that I will manage it. I think I bring some fresh ideas to my new home, the skills that I learned in another environment and an element of diversity to the society. I don't feel I have the right to give advice to newcomers yet, however, it's important to follow our dreams no matter where we are. Home is where you feel safe and protected enough to follow your path, as well as to share your personality, qualities and competence."
598	Marina	Spain	United Kingdom	E	E	close	27409	40718	E	im	female	I'm a journalist working in the UK, where I moved from my home in Spain in search of opportunities. Looking back on my initial relocation, I would urge anyone considering economic migration to learn the language before getting to your new country. They must also prepare mentally, to do the kind of work they never thought they would do in their country of origin. Another challenge to overcome is the lack of respect between cultures. People immigrate to find opportunities, but I don't think it means people in the host nation can criticize my country of origin, even if it's done as a joke. I have lived through this situation several times already. We should all at least try to understand everybody else's culture! There are ways to do this actively. I remember seeing a campaign on TV that showed ways to bring people from different origins and backgrounds together. The moderator would put people in groups based only on their interest or feelings. For example, one group was made up of people that have been bullied, one group had people who considered themselves to be happy, another group had people that like tennis and so on. The result was that each group would consist of different types of people — maybe a lesbian, an English hooligan, a red head and a Muslim — that might normally not hang out together. But for this exercise they were united because they shared interests which go beyond origin, culture and skin colour. I think activities like that are useful.
599	Marine	Georgia	Georgia	I	I	close	3984	3984	E	hc	female	"In 2004 my husband left for Spain in search of a job, and later I joined him there as well. My family was happy, because we were earning enough to support our family in Georgia from there. In those 9 years that I spent in Spain, I changed jobs several times. At first it was hard I could not speak a word of Spanish, I missed my daughter and I had to adjust to a new and different culture, traditions and lifestyle. But then I managed to bring my daughter to Spain as well. I started working for a Spanish family; I was taking care of their children and they made me feel like a member of their family.  They also help my husband find a job and helped my daughter in getting a proper education. I cannot image what my life in this foreign place would be without these people. We came back to Georgia in 2014. I miss my years in Spain and I cherish the experiences and skills that I gained there. Most of all, I value the social skills that I gathered there. Now I tell people that migration can be more than just separation from your homeland. It can be a very positive experience if you are lucky and you meet the right people."
600	Marinete	Brazil	Brazil	L	L	close	6797	6797	E	hc	female	I grew up in Pedra Corrida, Brazil, a miserable place. As we were very poor and did not have enough food for everyone, my parents borrowed us to other people. We would work in peoples houses in exchange for food. Despite our efforts, four of my mothers 16 children died of hunger. Once, my father sent my sister and me to a neighbour. We had to clean his house while his wife was away. He asked me to get something in the room, then he closed the door and told me to go to the bed. I started to cry and scream. I was only eight. Fortunately, my sister and I managed to run away. After that I did not talk to my father for 10 years. Parents should protect their children and not put them in situations of risk. Later on my auntie took my sisters Lena, 10, and Nezinha, 11, to work in Belo Horizonte. For a whole year my mother did not hear anything from them. She was always crying. One day she sold a pig to get money to buy a train ticket to go there and look for them. She made announcements on radio and newspaper. First she found Lena, who had been working in a house of a family day and night just like a slave. Later on she found Nezinha. They had tried to force her to work in a brothel, but she ran away and was living on the streets. Fortunately, we moved to São Paulo. Here there was abundance. Even when we had to beg on the streets in the beginning, we always had food. Later on we found jobs and started to build a new life. Now I work cleaning houses. I have two daughters and one son and theyve never had to go through the same misery as me. They have never been hungry and have never had to beg. I am happy here.
601	Mario	Albania	United States	E	N	far	5181	63123	H	im	male	"Mario Ademaj is not a rock star, though he likes to sing from time to time, as he did this summer when he experienced the groom's emotions. In life he works as a doctor. His passion is charity. Mario and his wife came to Albania from California, where they live, to celebrate love in their country of origin, in Albania, at their roots. After the wedding, tradition dictates that the couple to go on a honeymoon, but there are priorities. Before the honeymoon, Mario will perform the annual ritual - during one day he must offer residents of a city medical visits and free drugs. I finished medical school in America and I thought I should do something for my country, says Mario. Two years ago, along with some volunteer doctors from the United States and Albania, they offered this service to Pogradec residents. Within a day 2000 patients came to us, who had not seen a doctor for the last 5 years, mainly for financial reasons. This time he chose the city of Shkodra and managed to inspire new volunteers. Mario left Albania early. He had never dreamed that one day would study medicine in America. The choice was made possible by his father's grave disease, from the need he had, not only for medical help, but above all human needs. Unfortunately he failed to keep his father alive, but pledged to do everything for others. For Mario, medicine is all about humanity; while at school he shaped the idea of a free ambulatory clinic in the service of compatriots. Today, this idea is concretized in an organization called the International Medical Team for Albania, which is supported by various Albanian families. For the funds we have an extraordinary Albanian-American community in the US, Mario adds. We're In different states, Michigan, Wisconsin, California, Chicago. Families that support us in America are not rich families, they have no money to spare, but they greatly appreciate the serious health situation in Albania. The funds they give to us go towards medications. The minimum that Albanians deserve is health. Marios's plan is that one day, his free clinic will be extended to all areas where Albanians live."
602	Mario and Fatima	Germany	Australia	E	O	far	45909	55823	E	im	n	"February 17, 2018 was the date when Australias National Multicultural Festival took place in Canberra, Australias capital. The festival brings together people from a number of countries to proudly showcase their background. It also brings visitors from around the world to enjoy the cultural diversity. Dr. Mario Feigel and his wife Fatima Feigel took part in the festival during their visit to Australia. They currently live in Germany, where Mario is originally from, and where Fatima migrated to from Bosnia over in the 1970s years ago. Fatima comes to Australia often, to visit her brother who lives in New South Wales and her niece in Adelaide; they moved to Australia as refugees after suffering from the Balkan War in the early 90s. They came here to start a new life and they feel very good in this country, said Fatima. Then Mario explained, Germany on the other hand is experiencing difficulties in dealing with migration, we were not prepared. Although I know it is a big challenge for Germany, I also understand that migrants need support and a response to their situation. I am a member of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) and Im against all the troubles that war and conflict have caused in so many countries. I hope that the IAAM campaign will move people to accept migrants and to help them integrate into their new country in a smooth and helpful way. When asked if she missed anything from Bosnia, Fatima replied: I miss swimming in the Adriatic Sea and the dishes are different in Bosnia, but I have been living in Germany for so long, I have fully integrated. She is a nurse - she got her training in nursing in Sarajevo so she could apply to work in the German health system and thats how we met each other, I am a doctor you see, Mario added. Fatima feels that her heart is in Bosnia, Germany and Australia. So many places to call home! If you feel at home this plays an important role, she explained. Mario concluded by saying that the help of people from all the different cultures to support migrants to integrate is key. We dont have that in Germany, you see there are so many different cultures here in Australia and this helps with integration. We havent had that experience in Germany, it slowly builds up and I hope we will become better one day."
603	Mario Araya	Costa Rica	Canada	L	N	far	12077	43560	E	im	male	I am a chemistry professor and thanks to my work at a university, I was able to get a scholarship to study a doctorate in the city of Montreal, in the province of Québec. One of the initial difficulties I faced was language. Even though my English is good, I am in a francophone province, that also has a very particular way of speaking which is not taught in French classes in my country. The change in my field of study and returning to school after 8 years of graduating from college were difficult as well. The experience has been very emotionally challenging. It is not easy to build a support network from zero. I miss my friends and family, and it has hurt me to not be there with them for certain moments. However, here I have become close friends with other migrants and we have supported each other a lot. I feel I have grown so much as a person and that I have achieved a level of independence and obtained some personal skills that perhaps I wouldnt have acquired in my country. I have also learned that you are not alone and that you must fight to be well, taking care of your physical, mental and emotional health. I advise all people who are outside their countries to seek resources that are available: agencies that help migrants, counselors, therapists among others. Living in Montreal has been a very enrichening experience not only because you are in contact with people from many different nationalities, with their own languages, cultures, and ways of thinking. It is also a city with great college energy and the fact of being in the province of Quebec give it a North American identity with a strong European influence. Due to the conditions of my scholarship, I must return to Costa Rica to work, which gives me a competitive advantage, but also gives me the feeling of not being at home when I travel to my country nor when I am at Montreal. I think being a migrant is to have different places you call home and to know that wherever you are, and you can grow, there is your home.
604	Marion	Kenya	Kenya	A	A	close	1879	1879	E	hc	female	When I realized I was going to work in Kenya I saw it as a great opportunity. I had prior knowledge that Lodwar was a harsh area because I had friends who came to work here and resigned or went back home within one month. My first experience was tough. I did not know anyone here. I arrived during the rainy season and the house I got was flooded the first night. Not to mention the unbearable heat during the day. It took me about a month to start settling in, getting out and socializing. Having worked in the humanitarian world, I started to look at Lodwar from a different angle. I wondered what I could do that could make a difference. I sought to understand what Lodwar was about and why the residents were the way they were. And within no time, I realized I was going to stay longer. It has been three years now. I feel that there is more to do. If I had stayed on after the first night with the floods and the incessant heat the next day, surely, I could stay longer. Feeling that I have contributed to improve a community or an individuals life makes me happy. I look at it from the perspective of making lemonade out of lemons. I have so much lemonade now and I do not know how to share it. The people I meet in my work give me a lot of joy because I see radiance in their faces. I think I am going to stay here, until I feel I have done my best. There is still so much more that I can do.

Born in Switzerland, she would go and come between the two countries until 1999 when she and her husband decided to settle in Paraguay. Due to a tragic plane crash she was widowed a year later, but continued to live in the country: I decided to stay because I love the country. I went growing with cattle and genetics. I export to the whole world through the company Viradoce. At the beginning it wasn´t easy because when I widowed everyone thought that my husband was the one that made all the work but then they realized I also knew the field, the people and the work. I was born with animals, my father had lands and all kinds of animals, hence I know about it. Maris is a well-known cattle businesswoman and also a great activist in defense of animals´ rights who, through her Foundation, performs all kinds of work for this purpose. Since 2013, she has been the Director of the Asunción Botanical Garden and Zoo and also a Goodwill Ambassador of OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health). Her love for Paraguay is more than evident: I wasn´t born in Paraguay, but I am Paraguayan, she tells with pride. I traveled a lot around the world, I have a house and a family in Switzerland, but I always want to come back: my place is in Paraguay. Her advice to people who wish to emigrate is that one must always have clear ideas, think what is left behind and what you will find. Transparency, honesty, respect to the persons and the country where one is going to settle are also essential elements to Maris when it comes to migration. You have to give something to the country. You have to love the country where you are going to, not only claim and demand: one must give too. I think I contribute to the country, and I do it with pleasure because it is my country. I'm not saying you have to forget your roots. I do not forget that I am Swiss by birth, but Paraguay is my country. I live here and the country gives me the opportunity to work; I have to respect the law and order and not look at those who do not, I have to have a line and above all, persevere ."

I am the youngest of three in my family. In 2000 I finished a bachelor in computer science at university. That same year, I met my now husband. We met while he was on holiday in the Philippines. After he left, we started writing to each other for a year. He came back to the Philippines in 2001 and we got married. My husband then went back to Australia for a few months and I was left behind because it was really hard to get a visa at that time. My first visa application was denied, so we decided to move to Thailand to be together. That was the first time I was away from my family and it was very hard. I didnt speak the language in Thailand, but I found a job as a librarian in an American International School where I worked for about 10 years. In 2014, we decided to try again to move to Australia and this time I got my visa granted. My first impression of Australia was that it was so quiet! In the Philippines and Thailand you see people walking and working in the streets at all times. So I decided to get involved in community support and volunteering to meet more people. I got a certificate in Community Services and then started doing hourly work in the multicultural centre. I also volunteer in a dementia and delirium program at the hospital once a week. My mother turned 82 this year, she is living by herself in Philippines. I miss her and its really hard to be away from her. That inspired me to volunteer in the dementia and delirium program. Helping elderly people makes me think that my mum will be helped by others. Im now planning to get a diploma in social work because my passion is helping people in my city and I want to be as prepared as possible.

I came to the UK straight after passing the Polish equivalent to A-levels and applied to universities. I spent the happiest years at SOAS, University of London, studying Politics and South Asian Studies. I love South Asia and I went to India twice to volunteer and conduct a short fieldwork for my dissertation. In my final year I directed a student play on the Partition of India and Pakistan. I learned Hindi and Odissi (an Indian classical dance form) from classes at the Bhavan Centre for Indian Arts and Culture. I also performed Indian dances back in Poland! In the mean time I did coffee shop jobs, and I was a waitress for a few weeks. I also worked as a catering assistant, so I know all about that side of life in London as well. Now I work part time as a Project Manager for a recycling management company as I am a passionate vegan and environmentalist. I am also a Volunteer Coordinator for the London Indian Film Festival, which I have been volunteering with for the past 4 years. I love engaging with the South Asian diaspora in London, especially when it comes to films and theatre. I am currently studying for a Masters degree in Development Management at the London School of Economics and Political Science. I am passionate about labour rights especially in the developing world, and South Asia in particular. I want to fight the precariousness of labour in our times. I want to abolish zero hour contracts, casualised and insecure labour, exploitative and enslaving forms of employment that are covered up by the narratives of job creation and economic growth. I want to fight for women's rights but with greatest respect for cultural and legal pluralism. I want equality and dignity for all people and a just economic system.

608	Martha	México	United States	L	N	far	8326	63123	H	im	female	Everything was big, everything was tall and shiny. Everything was developed. That was Martha's first impression of the United States. It was everything I wanted to see in my city. Martha is from Tampico in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. My city is very small. It is a port city. We have a beach, it is very nice, it is a beautiful place, but increasing safety concerns forced her to move out. Martha arrived in Washington, , in January 2016 for an internship after graduating with a degree in international business. She looks forward to a career in international development, and will eventually return to Mexico 'to help and make an impact.' I decided to come to the United States because I feel that here there are opportunities to take action. I want to take actions towards the issues that I see in societies. Before coming to the United States, Martha had to move within Mexico to a safer town far from the war of drug cartels. I was not safe in my city. I had to move out and study somewhere else where I could have a normal life. I moved alone because my family had their own business. The most difficult part was being scared even in the safest areas. I would walk in the streets and still be scared by every noise or suspicious activity. It was hard to get used to it and to understand that I was not in danger anymore. It is still hard for me to walk at night and feel safe in the United States I am scared and I don't know if it is something psychological that I brought with me from my home country. Nonetheless, Martha feels lucky because she was able to come legally to the United States unlike millions of illegal immigrants who face poor, demeaning treatment. I have seen how illegal immigrants are looked at and treated. It makes me mad because they seem to have no rights. No one should feel worthless. I hope that women and children worldwide will stop being in situations where they need to migrate. And if they do migrate, I hope it is because they want to travel and see the world, not because they need to escape from economic or safety concerns.

I'm married to a great Bosnian man, which was the main reason I came here. We tried to live in Bosnia but it didn't work for me and Croatia wasn't much easier for my husband. We wanted to go somewhere where it didnt matter what nationality you are. We just wanted to have normal life. We had heard about IOM helping people find a better life. We weren't too optimistic but we applied for the visa. After almost two years nothing had happened and we thought that we wouldnt go anywhere, but just then things started to happen. We had a first interview, and not very long after we had medical checks and just like that we had a call that said you are leaving Croatia on the 14th of February 2001.  That was a huge shock because we had only two weeks to prepare before travel. It was hard but we knew we had to try. Our baby was only three years old and we just wanted something better for her. The 16th of February we landed in Canberra, we were tired, scared, didnt know what to expect, and knew zero English. Luckily we had a group of volunteers, who we cant thank enough for all their help and support,  and a translator who helped us through the first days, even months. Australia was a country that I had only heard about in my geography classes, and suddenly it became my home. Step by step, I started to learn about Australia and every day I liked it more and more. I was amazed by all the tall, intimidating buildings that I saw on my first visit to Sydney. Luckily people here are friendly and helpful.  My husband and I went to school to learn English while our daughter went to childcare. I was and still am amazed by the opportunities that Australia has to offer if one only seeks them out. Recently, we became Australian citizens.  We've been in Australia for fifteen years now and weve never thought about leaving. Moving here has proved to be the best decision.  Australia is our home. I miss my family and friends and would love to go visit them but now I say I go home to Australia. Now we live in Perth and we love it. My husband and I are working and our baby of three years has become a young lady of almost nineteen, she studies and works and loves Australia just as much as her parents.

This played a powerful role in influencing my work and passions. Adjusting to the frosty Canadian weather as a 4 year old was certainly a challenge, and I missed my country of the Czech Republic terribly. It took some time to overcome the language barrier, but my family and I felt embraced by our new home, and our new beginning. It is not easy to go from speaking solely Czech, a very complex Slavic language, to English. The language-related learning struggles became some of the most entertaining and memorable moments of my childhood. Because Canada is a wonderfully diverse place, we were encouraged to keep our national identity. This mosaic in which we lived in allowed me to have friends from all over the world, giving me the chance to learn about different cultures, foods, and traditions. We learned about and celebrated each other's differences, but all in all, we were equalised by one very special thing - we were all new Canadians. Being an immigrant myself, this vast cultural education was an opportunity to gain a fresh, global perspective. My new environment, defined by the multitude of nationalities, inspired me to pursue a path focused on elevating the status quo for everyone and creating positive change. Throughout my life, I have sought to empower people to build a better world for themselves and their communities. My fervent passion of fostering harmony led me to pursue work in law, politics, and advocacy. In 2014, my dreams became reality; I won Your Big Year, an international competition with over 80,000 applicants. I acted as World Merit Global Ambassador, giving me the great opportunity to visit over 30 countries and encourage young people to live true to their purpose. I continue to strive for a more inclusive, collaborative, and peaceful world through all of my work. Martina served as Global Ambassador for World Merit and also serves as a One Young World Coordinating Ambassador. "
611	Martine	Belgium	Switzerland	E	E	close	45028	86919	E	im	female	I left Belgium when I was 23 to travel to the then Zaïre -now DRC- with my husband who went there on a UNDP assignment. I was so excited to discover a new continent and particularly this huge diversified country, its people and culture, but I also discovered huge inequalities and extreme poverty. I stayed in several African countries for many years and this broadened my horizons and enriched me as a human being. I then decided to launch a humanitarian project in Sierra Leone after the civil war in 2003 to give access to primary education to the children of four rural villages. This school is the only opportunity for 350 children in that area to have access to primary education. After having lived ten years in Africa and five years in the USA, I arrived in Geneva. It is here that, together with Antoine Marguier, we decided to create a multi- cultural orchestra defending the United Nations spirit and its values. Subsequently, in 2011, Antoine and I co-founded the United Nations Orchestra. In our view, music is a universal language which does not discriminate or categorize people but unites them. Also, through our Orchestra, we bring awareness for the less fortunate who are struggling to survive. And last but not least, we aim at giving our audiences an opportunity to appreciate the great music the Orchestra provides. Each concert triggers strong emotional feelings within me. It is impressive to watch our talented musicians who give their very best. Equally impressive is to observe the enthusiasm of the audience who is coming to support a good cause.
612	Maru	Ethiopia	Ethiopia	A	A	close	840	840	E	hc	male	I wanted better work so I left Ethiopia in January 2017. I completed grade 10 but I could not go to university and I could not get a job — grade 10 results were not good enough, so I thought the only option was migration. I ended up in prison in Malawi for about ten months because I had entered the country illegally, and finally came back to Ethiopia in December 2017 with IOM's help. IOM and the EU helped me with transportation, they bought my air ticket back to Addis and accommodated me for about two days. They have also given me training, which helped because we learned how to open a business and how to analyze and select the target market, plus I got a certificate from the training. During the training, I chose to go into grain trading because I had worked with cereals before. IOM and the EU provided me with teff, maize and beans to start the business, but I rented the shop and weighing machine out of my own pocket with loans from relatives. My business started in 2018. For the time being, I am doing well but some of my customers are looking for different types of cereals, so I have to provide them for their customer satisfaction. I am also looking for more money from my relatives to expand my business. In the future, I will provide wheat, sorghum, millet and all the different cereals for my customers. I am reinvesting my profit in the business so I will be able to provide these things within a few months. I have taken some loans from relatives for more expansion so that I can also sell grains wholesale. After that, I will repay their money. I am very, very happy now thanks to IOM and the EU. I would not migrate or travel like that ever again due to the suffering I experienced and saw.
613	Marwa	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	female	"My name is Marwa. I am 38 years old and I come from Latakia in Syria. Since November 2015 I have been living in Berlin. Back home, I worked as a teacher. I have three children, two girls and a boy. This is my story. I divorced my husband four years ago but as there are no rights for mothers in Syria, he has full custody for our children. It was after the divorce that I decided to visit my sister, who lives with her husband in Turkey. I could not stay, but I heard that teachers were needed in Idlib, about 50 km from Aleppo, so I moved there. Although the war was ongoing, it was not that bad when I arrived there. I had a flat and I taught Arabic. Then the situation deteriorated. We were attacked from the air, the military moved closer, and different armed groups were fighting nearby. One day, some extremists came to me. They threatened me, saying that I cant continue to live alone, as a divorced woman. They said I should either find a new husband or they would choose someone for me. I packed my bags the minute they left my place. But I had nowhere to go. Coming from Idlib – a rebel-held area – I could not go back to Latakia, where they would have arrested me. So I fled to Turkey. But believe me, the situation in Turkey is not easy at all, especially as a single woman without a chance to work. I decided to leave and head for Greece. It was not easy to think of the boat, as we knew we might not make it. But luckily we did and moved forward, aiming to reach Germany. It was a very difficult journey, as difficult as you could possibly imagine. I was travelling alone, with nobody to defend me. I had to find a place to sleep on my own, find something to eat on my own. We slept on the ground; we slept everywhere. We were travelling by foot, sometimes by bus or train. After 15 days, we finally reached Germany. At the beginning, I lived in a gym with people of all nationalities. It was the first time in my life that I was in touch with so many different people! Now I have moved to a former school, into a real room that I share with another woman. The people here are all from different countries. They are helpful and very kind. In Berlin, I have done many things already with my German friends and other refugees – we have been to the cinema and the opera. For the first time in my life, I have been ice-skating. You feel the freedom here. What hurts me terribly is that I have not really seen my children for four years. They are living with a sister of their father in Latakia. I am in touch with them through internet, but my 14-year-old son ran away from his aunts place and is now stranded at the border with Turkey. His situation is very dangerous and it breaks my heart that I cannot do anything; I can barely reach him by phone. I am like all mothers – I miss my children badly and I wish they could be here, away from war, away from persecution, away from the whole political situation. That they could have the chance to go to school or to university, the chance to live a safe and happy life. I am hopeful that someday my children can come here too. Because I have the chance to be here, a chance that so many others do not have, I wish that this war would be over. Twenty-three million Syrians still live there, they live in the midst of war and they suffer from hunger. I wish they would have a future of freedom and peace."
614	Mary	Ghana	Ghana	A	A	close	2206	2206	E	hc	female	In Ghana, I used to work in a restaurant as an accountant. The salary I was earning wasn't enough to pay my school fees. One day after talking to a friend living abroad, I began to think of traveling as well. She gave me the contact number of her boyfriend, who was an employment agent. He told me he could help me go to Turkey to work as a waitress where I could earn US $1,000 a month. He told me that the company I would work for would use part of this salary to pay for my travel documents and airfare. Once I arrived, I realized that I was actually in Iraq and not in Turkey. When I called my friend to ask her, she told me that Iraq and Turkey were the same place. I was sent to work as domestic help in a house where I wasnt even given food every day and was treated very poorly. I was sleeping under the staircase in a small makeshift room. They only paid me about US $250 a month and I wasn't allowed to go outside. Whenever the family went out, they locked the door behind them. I wanted to go home. One day, I managed to go to the agents office, where I was told that I had to work for at least a year and a half to repay my debt. Eventually, I was sent to a different employer, but things there were even worse. My employer once fired a gun in the house when I couldn't get his son to stop crying, and he even held the muzzle of the gun to my chest. I still have the burn mark. After the third employer treated me just as badly I managed to get out of the house by saying I needed to go to the supermarket. Once there, I bought a SIM card and called the number for IOM that I had managed to get in secret. A few days later a lawyer and his interpreter, provided for by IOM, were waiting for me at the police station. The police men were very rude to me, they kept saying I was a liar. Finally, they sent me to a safe place but, somehow, the agent found the address and came there to threaten me, saying that he would kill me. I didnt have access to a phone and my lawyer was not allowed to visit me. I told the personnel at the safe house that if they didnt send me back home I would kill myself. I stayed there for a week without taking a bath or even brushing my teeth. The agent came again, and this time he said he would buy a ticket for me to return home but I didnt trust him. I heard that sometimes agents pretend to buy return tickets for Ghanaians but instead they send them to other countries. I preferred to stay in the safe house even if it was similar to prison. Eventually I managed to get a ticket home thanks to IOM Ghana. With their help, I set up my own shop selling clothes and bags for women upon my return. Before going to Iraq I didnt believe what people said about their experiences abroad, but after what I went through I can say that it's better to stay in ones own country and work hard than go to another country. When you're abroad, people mistreat you and only give you the jobs they dont want to do themselves.
615	Mary	South Sudan	South Sudan	A	A	close	1421	1421	E	hc	female	Mary has been living in the Protection of Civilians site of Bentiu, South Sudan for about two years, after fleeing her home in Koch County following the conflict that broke out in the country in late 2013. She is one of four wives, and a mother of three children. She only managed to escape with one child and the other two children were left behind under the care of one of her husbands other wives. The journey from Koch to Bentiu PoC took her 3 full days. Mary fell sick in December 2015, developing symptoms of cough, chest pain, back pain and headache. At the time, she was eight months pregnant with her third child. She says that she visited several clinics for treatment, but with no improvement. One day, she was visited in her home by an IOM Health Promoter, who referred her to the IOM clinic. Here, she was examined by a clinician who suspected she had TB. IOM collected and tested sputum samples, which confirmed she had TB. She was immediately started on anti-TB medication, and, shortly after starting treatment, Mary went into labour and gave birth to a healthy baby girl. The IOM staff went the extra mile to support her with her treatment after delivery, conducting daily home visits to deliver her daily medication and check on her condition and progress. In addition, she has received nutritional support in terms of a months supply of dried foods: sorghum, lentils, cooking oil and corn-soya blend. After the initial four weeks of treatment, Mary was already reporting dramatic improvements in her health. The cough was gone, she started gaining weight and her voice had started to recover. She is looking forward to completing her treatment so that she can better care for her children. Migrants face higher exposure to TB infection due to overcrowded living conditions. They often do not have access to correct TB related information on prevention, transmission and latent infections due to language barriers as well as cultural beliefs. Mary, like many other displaced or migrants who received treatment, is now safe and can take care of her children.
616	Maryam	Iran	United Kingdom	M	E	far	11183	40718	E	im	female	"The day I left with my mother was not meant to be the last time I ever saw Iran, or my grandmother, or some of my closest family and friends. If I had known I would never be able to return, I would have paid more attention to the little details. I would have hugged my grandmother more closely. When she died, we could not even return for her funeral. In May 1983, my mother, sister and I arrived in New York, three days before my 17th birthday (via India and Britain where we were not given residency). The immigration officer confiscated our passports at the airport but let us in temporarily. What a relief to see my father again; he had come earlier to prepare for our arrival. I'll never forget the day we got to our new home. It was early morning when we arrived at our flat - or at least that is how I remember it. There were mattresses on the floor and a TV in the living room - that's it. My father took us to Pathmark, a supermarket near us, where we gawked at how big it was and that it was open 24 hours a day. From that day on, my parents worked hard - starting from scratch; sometimes treated so unfairly. I joined university, whilst working part-time, and my little sister started school. It was difficult for the first few years, especially for my parents. But we were one of the lucky ones. Our family was given a lifeline when we were granted US residency and later citizenship - that piece of paper, which is often a matter of life and death, and the difference between being labelled legal and illegal. I can't help but remember those years we moved around trying to find a place to call home when I see whats happening now. The insecurity and fear still returns whenever I cross a border where I often have to remind myself that my papers are in order. I moved to Britain in 2000 where I now live and campaign for human rights, secularism and freedom of expression and belief. My retired parents still live in Yonkers, New York in the same flat; my sister teaches at a Yonkers public school. Though I have lived outside of Iran more than inside it, it is still a part of who I am. But so is Britain where I now live and so is the US where I feel just as much at home when I return to visit my parents and sister. Home for me is definitely where one lives and loves and struggles. In this day and age, migrants and refugees are often criminalised and dehumanised, and deemed different but the only real difference is that piece of paper. Move beyond it and we meet where our common humanity resides."
617	Massoud	Afghanistan	Greece	I	E	far	508	18117	H	im	male	Massoud, together with his wife and two daughters, came to Greece from Afghanistan a year and a half ago. They spent most of this time at Elliniko, the former Athens international airport turned into an unofficial camp site during the peak of the refugee crisis. Its been three months now that Elliniko, infamous for the harsh living conditions, was evacuated. Massoud and his family were among the 350 people who moved to the renovated accommodation centre close to the historic city of Thiva. Leaving our motherland was a not an easy decision to make. However, there are many problems in Kabul: security issues, suicide attacks, bombs, constant gunfire. These are some of the reasons people from Afghanistan are coming to Europe. Theres no security, we cannot walk in the streets because we dont know when another bomb is going to blast, theres always trouble and its getting worse. So, we left in 2016 and it took us about 28 days to arrive. It was a really bad journey. Its dangerous when you cross the borders and even more dangerous when crossing the sea. But people are doing it because they dont have much of a choice. We crossed to Greece before the EU-Turkey deal, the border was still open. We arrived on the island of Chios in February and went straight to the northern border, where tried to cross to Macedonia. However, by that time, the border had closed. We didnt stay at the makeshift camp, there was no way Id let my family stay there. We came back to Athens, to the unofficial site of Elliniko. The experience there was not good, there were way too many people, we were living in tents. At first it was really bad and to be honest, it never got better until we settled here in Thiva. Its been 3 months that we live here and we feel so much better. People finally have a nice place to live, the conditions are so improved. Each family has its own space, either a container or an apartment, a place we can call home. We can cook, we have running hot water, air conditioning and solar panels. We are very well equipped, everythings really good. And the people working here are really nice, they listen to us, they help us. Back in Afghanistan I was working for European companies in the field of logistics and Ive learnt English through my work, a fact that has helped me a lot. I would like to build a life here in Greece, get a job to support my family. My wife and the girls want to stay here in Greece, the people are nice and friendly, everyone is treating our children with love and I really like that. I believe that our future is going to be better, for my daughters in particular. Thats why people are coming to Europe, to ensure a bright future for their kids. My girls are 9 and 4. The older one goes to school here in the camp and come September, she will attend the local Greek school. Im really looking forward to see her back to school!
618	Mathi	Sri Lanka	Indonesia	I	I	close	3768	3870	E	im	male	Mathi (43) comes from Sri Lanka and is now living in Medan, North Sumatra in Indonesia. Being a migrant is very painful, mentally and physically. Leaving my family, my wife and son behind to seek asylum in a foreign land because of the war, means living a life that is bleak and full of uncertainties. I used to feel so bored sitting all alone in my room. One day while I was having a cup of tea and looking out my window I saw all the little children of my fellow migrants playing on the ground very cheerfully, unaware about what the future might hold. They inspired me! I told myself that I shouldnt be sitting idle and wasting my time and talent. I should do something useful for myself and my community. I took stock of my abilities and realized the thing I had to offer them was my passion for teaching. Unfortunately, we cant send our children to formal schools in Medan like the locals. When I shared my thoughts with my friends Suresh and Selvi they said theyd had exactly the same idea! It all clicked so well. So we called all the parents in for a talk and explained our intentions. All of them welcomed our idea and agreed to send their children to attend our classes. Now we have 25 Sri Lankan and Somali children aged between six to 12 years old and the classes are going very well. We run the classes from Monday through Friday, from 8.00 am till 3.00 pm just like a regular school, only we are unpaid volunteers. The classes include the Tamil and English languages, mathematics and general knowledge based on school syllabuses used in Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia, and materials found on the Internet. If I can shed some light into another persons life and make them a better person, then why not? It makes me feel like a very complete person. The only thing I could dream of is to be reunited with my family resettled in a peaceful country. I ask for nothing more.
619	Matteo	Italy	Belgium	E	E	close	31238	45028	E	im	male	I have been a migrant for a long time. I first gave up my job in Italy and moved to work in Scotland, because I wanted to improve my English. Then I lived in Northern Ireland, and Spain. And now in Brussels. I wanted to learn more about the European Union, so I came here to study for a Masters degree on the topic. I always wanted to see how things outside Salerno worked. I wanted to grow and be independent. I deal with many different cultures in my daily life and at work, so over time, I think Ive learned to be more diplomatic, understand more and not judge so much. Ultimately I think migration is about learning. I have been in Brussels for a while – six years in fact. When I first came, I didnt feel like I was moving to Belgium, I was moving to the capital of the European Union. But once here, I really liked it. Brussels is great and really international. What I dont like here is the bureaucracy, and how it is very often not working. But then again: that helped me appreciate Italy more. I always thought only there did we have problems with these things. Turns out thats not the case. When I experience something in a new environment that I dont like, it helps me appreciate my own country. Im Italian, but also European. I feel at home, where I live. Wherever I move, I always take two things with me: my tea mug and my English grammar book. Its from 1994 and like my bible. My next move will be to Germany, to live there with my boyfriend. But first I need to get better at German. I always want to be able to communicate with the people in the country I live in. I would not feel comfortable if I wasnt. To me it is also a sign of respect for the country Im moving to.
620	Matthew	Australia	Germany	O	E	far	55823	45909	E	im	male	"I came to Berlin to do my masters thesis. It was a sparkle of fate that brought me here. I didnt know much about the city apart from Currywurst (pork sausage) and obviously the history of the wall. I was in a conference in Copenhagen where I met this professor from the University of Berlin. We talked about wind energy a lot and after that he offered me to do my PhD in his department. We work on a special field where we research how to optimize wind energy. As wind bioenergy engineers we are chasing cost efficiency. Culturally, it is easier to be here than back in Australia. Although I still find few things a bit strange, like the need to purchase insurance for every little thing, I feel more comfortable in Germany and I like living here. Where is home is a question I cant answer anymore. I have a strong attachment to my home town in Australia, but over the time that I have been abroad, the links get stronger and stronger here. My life seems more relevant in Germany now. What I like about Berlin is the social freedom; if you like wearing your pyjamas in the U-Bahn (underground) no one will care. I also appreciate how quick it is to get out and do some outdoor sports, which is surprising at first for a city like Berlin. The thing I miss most is my family. It is hard to watch my nephews and nieces grow up through Skype and not in real life. Id like to be the irresponsible uncle taking them out to do adventurous things."

However, I never wanted to stay in Europe; I just wanted to go, earn enough money for my family and come back to my country. However, once I arrived in Algeria, I started studying and quickly realized that with an education, I didnt need to go to Europe anymore so I started looking for jobs. Once I found a decent job in Algeria, I called my wife in Côte d'Ivoire and asked her to join me. She opened a small boutique where she sold different Ivorian products that African women couldnt find in Algeria. The shop was doing well, and so was my job, so we were very happy when she got pregnant. After giving birth earlier this year, she decided to stay home to take care of the baby while I worked. I tried to be with her as much as I could, but my workplace was 150 km away. One day while I was at work, my friend called me to say the Algerian authorities had come to my house. They had broken down the door and taken my wife and baby away. I went to look for them and found them in a refoulement centre. It was cold and there were no blankets. They hadnt let my wife take any belongings with her when they brought them there. We had nothing with us, only baby Adams. Two days later, they took us to Tamanrasset on a truck. It was the first time I saw the desert. I will never forget the sight of one of the people who fell off the truck and hit his head on the way to Tamanrasset. He died right then and there. One night when we were close to the border with Niger, in the middle of the desert, at 11 pm, they unloaded 100 people. They started shooting around to scare us into walking, and so we walked for about 20 km until we reached Assamaka. We slept under the shed until the IOM truck arrived and took us to the centre in Arlit. From there, we went to the centre in Agadez where I was chosen as the Ivorian representative. After all that we experienced, I am happy to welcome my brothers at the centre and help them get around."

My move was inspired by a desire to improve my language skils, but now that I'm here, I think I bring diversity and fun to my host country too! Migration is an opportunity to put yourself out of your comfort zone and achieve your personal goals. It can be a beautiful thing, but I would urge anyone attempting it to make sure that they are doing so for the right reasons. I myself had to face a few challenges in pursuit of those goals when I was looking for work. Most places wanted people who already had work experience in the UK. But I'm happy to say that those things are in the past now, and I feel right at home — with my dog, my cats and my partner.

The city was so much more organized and less crowded than my hometown. I then left for Geneva. An it was another cultural shock. After many years away from home I still miss my family, good fruits, my music and the spontaneity of the people. But I am glad I have music in my life. Music is one pillar of my life and has guided me throughout my life, from Colombia to Switzerland. Music made me discover so many new interesting people, from all around the world. I also had the chance to travel and be able to communicate through music. Last year, the UN orchestra went to South Korea to play with a local orchestra from Seoul at the DMZ. Given the languages constraints, my communication was not fluent with the Korean musicians at the beginning, it was only limited to smiles from both sides. However, once the two orchestras started playing together, the language barriers were not important anymore. At the end, we ended up enjoying the time without the need of expressing words, we connected with the others through music.

He is travelling through a taut parceled landscape of meadows and water. He had left Senegal, where he was forced to take refuge as a journalist from Gambia. But even there he was no longer safe. Earlier that year an article he worked on had been published on the front page of the Gambian Newspaper Foroyaa; a story about the disappearances of journalists and politicians who opposed the regime of President Jammeh. Mawdo had been hassled as a journalist before, but after this article his life was at stake. He had to flee. His wife and two-year-old daughter stayed behind. A year after his arrival in the Netherlands he received a residence permit, and one year later he was reunited with his family. Then somehing special happened at the end of 2016. After more than twenty years Gambia elected a new president. For a moment there was the threat of a civil war, because Jammeh did not want to give up power, but this was averted by international pressure. Jammeh disappears from the scene and Adama Barrow becomes the new leader. On his first day in office he spoke about the freedom of speech, Mawdo says. Mawdo then decided to go back with the help of IOM. It is safe for him now and he has a strong desire to further contribute to the development of his country as a journalist. I love the Netherlands, but I always said that if possible I would return to Gambia."
625	May	Syrian Arab Republic	Sweden	M	E	far	890	53575	H	im	female	My name is May, I am Syrian and I am Swedish. I am a daughter, a wife and a mother to triplets, my three musketeers. We came to Sweden three years ago as refugees. Nowadays we live in Teckomatorp, a small village outside of Malmö, before we lived in Damascus, Syria. We left Syria to protect ourselves, our children and our future. Sometimes I feel very ashamed and guilty because I managed to leave with my family and children. And I left without being able to help others. When we left, my mum and dad were still in Syria, but they died last year, they were very sick. My mum died from cancer and my father died 6 months later – he was depressed after my mums death. I would have wanted to do a lot of things with my children, my family and with my parents, go and see places. But now I have lost that chance – most of these places are destroyed now. In Damascus, in 2000, I volunteered for the Syrian Red Crescent and became a first aider in 2001. I especially remember one day when we were in the ambulance and we came to a checkpoint. They pointed their weapons at us, we couldnt go past them. We could hear shooting but we were not allowed to give help. On my birthday in November 2012, my friends asked me if I wished to travel, and I said no, I wouldnt want to leave Syria in a thousand years. Six months later we had to. I didnt want to leave, but I wanted my kids and my family to be safe. Now in Sweden, I feel that I have no choice other than to be positive and to integrate. It is for my sake, my childrens sake and my parents sake. Especially now, since I feel very guilty that my parents died without me being there for them. It was only when I came to Sweden that I realised that I am a refugee and I am not able to go back home. I have to create a very big reason and justification of why Im away. That reason is being successful in the new society and my new homeland. And this is what I have been trying to do, even though I feel very shattered sometimes. I am wearing colourful clothes because in our culture we say that pink breaks deep sadness. To help integrate into the new society, I run a project to teach Arabic in preschool through playing, so kids can connect with their culture. When children have a good connection to their mother languages, they can more easily learn new languages and get integrated into new societies. We need to understand each other and talk more about bridging cultures. That is what integration is about. When we came to Sweden, everyone said that Swedes have a lot of luxury and things that we do not have in Syria. I am not talking about material things, it is also about the way of thinking. However, then you start realizing that this is not luxury, these are basic human rights that we miss. We are waiting for Syria to be a free and peaceful country, which our people deserve. Then we might want to come back home. Although we really do feel home again, and we feel loyal to the country that received our family. Now I am both Syrian and Swedish.

Maya found a job by herself and did not resort to any public or private employment service. She enjoys her work and considers it allows her to afford a good standard of living in Bujumbura. She actually acknowledges that her financial situation has improved since moving to Burundi. Having lived in several big cities in the past, she describes the Burundian capital as small, chaotic and friendly. She feels that Bujumbura has quite a diverse population composed of both foreigners and Burundians from other parts of the country. Being fluent in both French and English and currently learning Kirundi, Maya manages to communicate with most people in the Burundian capital, where Kirundi, Swahili, French and English are the predominant languages. Maya decided to move into a shared house and has a formal tenancy agreement. The house is functional with running water, toilets, electricity, etc. and is located in a neighborhood that she considers safe. She did not receive any assistance from public or non-governmental services regarding accommodation. She feels comfortable in her house and in Bujumbura and in fact says that she feels at home in the city. When it comes to health services, she has health insurance and can easily go to the hospital or the doctor if needed. For the moment, Maya does not belong to any association and is not eligible to participate in municipal elections. As she recently arrived in Bujumbura, her knowledge of the city government is limited. Moreover, she still needs to learn what to do in case of natural disasters; Bujumbura is prone to floods and she does not know what safety measures to follow if this situation arises. Maya is planning to stay in Burundi for the next two years while maintaining contact with her community back home. After her Burundian experience, she would like to move around Africa and work in the field of development economics."
627	Maya	United States	Sri Lanka	N	I	far	63123	3768	L	im	female	"I was born and raised in the United States to Sri Lankan parents, but I was no stranger to the homeland, visiting every few years as a child. Although we lived in the United States, my parents made sure to instill Sri Lankan values in me. At home, the rules and norms were traditional and conservative, compared to those of my American friends and classmates. For example, all adults were to be addressed as Uncle or Aunty regardless of whether they were related to me or not – whereas my friends were all on a first-name basis with the adults they knew! Furthermore, in my household, there was a huge emphasis on education and academic performance. Participating in any activities that were seen as a distraction from school was frowned upon. I admit that this was a bit difficult growing up; especially during my teenage years, I really felt the culture clash between my Sri Lankan household and my American reality. I missed school dances and sleepovers, and my friends started to go out on dates before I was even allowed to attend a football game! Looking back, however, I understand how the traditional foundation my parents set has impacted my identity, my interests, and the decisions I have made throughout my life so far. My background and the exposure I had to the world, through my travels and interactions, really drove my interest in my studies, leading me to pursue a Bachelors degree in Sociology and a Masters in Social Policy and Development. From a young age, I sought to understand why there were such stark differences between the United States and Sri Lanka, and between the developed and developing world in general. I became committed to international development and to service – I felt there was so much I could do to help others in need. So I moved to Sri Lanka after my studies, mainly to pursue my career in development work. I found a new home in Sri Lanka, and finally felt like I could connect with and relate to people who had cultural upbringings similar to my own. In my time away from the United States, Ive learned so much more about the world and its people. I have a dual-lens which I think allows me to see a more balanced picture – the best of both worlds. I really hope to contribute to Sri Lanka by showing an example of how to reverse brain drain. Sri Lanka is a marvelous country with marvelous people, and its potential should be recognized."
628	Melissa	Honduras	México	L	L	close	2406	8326	E	im	female	Im from Honduras and Im a single mother. In my country I was working in a factory, but it was really difficult to provide for my four kids with a low wage. It was really difficult to keep going. Four years ago, some friends decided to come to Mexico and I came with them. I was heading to the United States, but I didnt reach my final destination. So I stayed in Mexico and I managed to bring my two elder sons. First, we lived in Guanajuato and currently we live in Oaxaca. Right now I am on the process of bringing my third child, so that we could live together. Here we can have a normal life because its safe and prices are more affordable. My children and I have worked since the beginning to move forward in our lives. In my previous experiences as a migrant I had to get on the train La Bestia alone and with them. I have taken it when it is at standstill and people go into the carriages, called gondolas, which have the space to sit. It is a one or two-day trip. When the train stops, people are getting off it to buy food very quickly and they get back on board. It has not been easy because I had to fight every day, walk long distances, and be separated of my other children, but Im convinced that here we can live a better life. In Celaya city I had a job in a family business where I was painting and cleaning apartments for rent. I have really tried to regularize my situation in Mexico because I want to live in Oaxaca with my family. Five months ago my grandchild was born here. I would like to see him grow, raise him and be with them. My youngest daughter is still living in Honduras with her dad. I have done some immigration proceedings, however the process is very long and difficult. I pray all the time and I ask God to provide us with jobs and protect us from all harm because we are not bad people.
629	Melkamu	Ethiopia	Kenya	A	A	close	840	1879	E	im	male	"Melkamu arrived in Kenya through the Moyale border town of Ethiopia in September 2011, after a long treacherous journey from Addis Ababa. A journey that could only be conquered by a dire search for freedom, an audacious hope in what lies ahead despite his current situation. In the beginning life was very hard, being in a foreign country for the first time with no friends or family, no knowledge of the local Swahili language and very little money. I remember that day like it was yesterday, a cold Thursday morning when I arrived in Eastleigh, Kenya, the bus I was on came to a stop and we were told this was its final destination. I was scared, no clue where to go or who to ask, but there was no turning back. Melkamu fell very ill a few days after his arrival, he was alone and could not eat anything, an attendant at his lodging place found him and alerted his colleagues who rushed him to a nearby clinic. I could not communicate with any of the clinics staff to tell them my symptoms, so they could not treat me. Being a private clinic, they also refused to treat me because I did not have any money. Luckily one of the nurses knew about the Eastleigh Wellness Center (EWC) where I could get free treatment. This experience motivated Melkamu to register as a Community Health Worker at the clinic so that he could help other migrants who face similar situations. In the Ethiopian migrant community in Nairobi, most people get fundraising to be able to take their loved ones to hospital, because they are not aware of government healthcare aid and other health facilities that offer free medical care. I am a community health worker because I want to help my people. The lack of knowledge about access and availability of health services in the Ethiopian migrant community has been high; since I started I have been able to bridge the gap between healthcare providers and the migrants. When I came to Kenya I did not know at first that as a migrant I could get the National Hospital Insurance Fund card, which greatly helps in paying hospital bills, especially when admitted. Five years later, Melkamu is now a renowned name among the Ethiopian migrant community in Nairobi, they seek his help not only in matters concerning health but other communal issues as well. The bustling city is now a second home to Micky, a former teacher. I may not be rich but I have peace and freedom, far more priceless commodities that I wish I could take back to my people in Ethiopia."
630	Melody	Iran	United Kingdom	M	E	far	11183	40718	E	im	female	Melody was born in Tehran, Iran, and she came to Europe as an asylum-seeker fleeing war. After we fled from Iran, my family and I lived in Sweden for 11 years. One day two men with guns threatened me and my brother while we were at home. After that, we decided to move to the UK in 1997. Moving to another country isnt easy. Weve done it twice, and had to start from zero each time. My mum was a single parent with 3 young children. I admire her strength immensely. What I found most difficult was the cultural shock. Persian culture is warm, passionate and outspoken. British culture is reserved, quiet and polite. The other challenges were racism and peoples ignorance. School years were the hardest years of my life in England- I was lonely and felt misunderstood. For example, I remember many people genuinely asked me if we had toilets in Iran. I felt like shouting- yes we do, we also invented civilization and human rights! I channeled my energy into the UK community and became a social entrepreneur. I found a way to make a difference in the country and give back. It was inspired by my previous 11 years of volunteering in my community, hoping to make a difference. After University, I got a job in the youth sector and after 2 years, left and set up my own business, InspirEngage International. Just recently in June 2015, I received an award from the European Parliament as New European Woman Influencer which especially seeks to recognize the work of migrants. The UK allows those who come here to work hard, and to also give back. It doesnt matter how you started, you can become successful if you are persistent and work hard. I am extremely happy about what I have been able to contribute to the UK in various projects such as Social Enterprise Revolution. I have worked in the Houses of Parliament, met with Tony Blair when the UK was considering whether to go to war with Iraq and appeared on BBC, Sky news and CNBC, and I have represented the UK at United Nations conferences, Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, TEDx and Global Entrepreneurship Summit hosted by Barack Obama – as a Speaker. I am happy to say I am a migrant! Even more, I am glad to say that I was a former asylum seeker. It enriches my story- but more importantly, it challenges peoples negative perception of the term.
631	Mercedes	Paraguay	Argentina	L	L	close	4950	8476	E	im	female	Mercedes was born in Ypejhú, Paraguay, in a large family with twelve brothers and sisters. Her father worked cultivating wheat and her brothers helped him from a very early age in order to support the family finances. When she was 18, Mercedes left home and went to live with her boyfriend, Pedro. Some years later, Maicol, her only son, was born but the couple decided to split up. Since she was unable to maintain her household, Mercedes decided to migrate to Argentina in the footsteps of her sisters and school friends. Her son stayed in Paraguay and Mercedes mother took care of him as she was already caring for her other grandchildren. Mercedes has been living in Buenos Aires for 15 years now, working as a cleaner, domestic help, and babysitter. At the beginning, her housing and working conditions were difficult: I was working informally, many hours a day, living in a rented room, sharing with other three Paraguayan women whom I didnt know, and I was missing my son a lot. When the economic situation became difficult in Argentina, Mercedes used all her savings to buy a ticket to Madrid, Spain, and moved there looking for new horizons: It was 2001, my boss had suddenly fired me, and the owner of my rented room asked me for more money to stay. I didnt think twice: I took my savings, bought the ticket and left with the only suitcase I had. In Madrid, Mercedes first job involved cleaning in a bar and then cooking in a restaurant. However, her employer was not treating her well and she was missing her family and son: When I was living in Buenos Aires, I always tried to escape to Paraguay to visit Maicol and spend time with my mum. I went by bus and it wasnt that expensive. While in Spain, it was impossible to travel home and I started to feel very lonely. That was when Mercedes decided to return to Argentina after two years in Madrid: I came back to Buenos Aires and it was starting from zero again. But the countrys situation was a bit better after recovering from the financial crisis. Currently, Mercedes lives in an apartment that she rents in the district of San Fernando, Buenos Aires Province, where other Paraguayan migrants also . Although it is small, she lives by herself and has running water, electricity and a toilet, something that she did not have in Ypejhú, where almost 45 per cent of the population does not have access to sanitation. My apartment is small but nice. I have to travel two hours to get to my job, but I dont care. I have decorated the room and it is now cosy. I feel good to have a little place for when my son visits me. However, Mercedes admits that she feels unsafe and is afraid of walking alone at night. Thinking about the future, Mercedes imagines herself with a foot in Buenos Aires and a foot in Asunción, where her son currently resides: When Im in Buenos Aires, I miss the Paraguayan rhythm, the calm, the tranquility and the warm temperatures all year round. But when Im there, I miss the movement of the city, the bars, the streets, the buildings. I think that, as a popular song says, Im not from here, not from there.

My teacher is a really nice lady - although I'd much prefer an orange bag instead of the blue one I got!. Merevais, from Kabul, Afghanistan, is a 12-year-old boy who, for the last 7 months, lives in an Open Accommodation Centre for Refugees in Athens. Thanks to European Commission funding he's going to school again, this time in Greece.

633	Meron	Eritrea	United States	A	N	far	588	63123	H	im	female	In 2005 when Eritreas only university shut its doors, I made the choice to leave my country in pursuit of higher education. I could not see any hope of change in the harsh treatment and indefinite military service that I was in. I knew little of what to expect when migrating. All I knew was that I needed to leave Eritrea. After running and walking for almost a day, five other people and I managed to arrive safely in Sudan in March 2005. It was here that I started to ask myself what I should do with my life. In pursuit of education, I travelled to South Africa by way of paid smugglers.  I felt confident in my choice to leave Eritrea until 2008 when xenophobic attacks against African migrants rose in South Africa. I could not leave my room for two weeks. My growing dissatisfaction with the countrys refugee management system lead a group of us to advocate for safer processes in seeking asylum. It was during this time that I co-founded a refugee led organization called Unity for Tertiary Refugee Students (UTRS), which advocated for university scholarships for refugee students. Seeing fellow refugees graduate was among one of the happiest moments of my life. I gave up working as an engineer. For the last six years I have been advocating for the plight of all refugees and the migration crisis and ending the human rights violations with the goal of building democracy in Eritrea. My advocacy takes the form of speaking at international Summits such as One Young World, writing articles at the Huffington Post and the G7G20 and being a panelist at university events. I have founded an initiative called Lead Eritrea, which allows me to help educate and network fellow Eritreans. I also recently founded a student association at my university called Student Outreach for Refugees, Asylees and Immigrants (SORAI) to help the most needy part of society. The plight of refugees is close to my heart. Looking back on life in my home country, I miss everything. More than anything, I miss my mother who I have not seen for more than 10 years. I keep myself so busy that I don't have much time to think and stress about all the things I miss. To date I am still a refugee and it has been more than ten years since I first left Eritrea. In this process I have become stateless, an asylee and a refugee. These moments changed the course of my life, but they werent all happy. I lost many friends while migrating. Many of my countrymen were held for ransom by smugglers, some of them had their organs trafficked in Egypt. Many drowned as they tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea. I have moved from country to country for the past ten years, and have grown attached to all the places I have been since. But I hope to return to Eritrea someday so I can help rebuild my country democratically and educate my society. Because I am a political refugee, I know I cannot go back to Eritrea so I try to make home wherever I go. Meron currently assists in resettling Eritrean refugees in California, and also serves as a One Young World Ambassador.
634	Miguel	México	Germany	L	E	far	8326	45909	H	im	male	My name is Miguel Angel Espinosa Calvo, I am 29 years old and from Mexico City. I am currently working for the German Federal Ministry of Finance as a trainee. While working here in Germany, I primarily noticed that Germans communicate in a much more direct way. When people talk to each other in a professional setting, it's always about exchanging information. No more and no less and as short and precise as possible. As soon as you start with a little small talk, they keep it very short or even say 'Get to the point'. I think that's one of the biggest differences, not only compared to Mexico, but to Latin America as a whole. At the beginning, I had difficulties coping with this, but as soon as I understood the German mentality better, I mostly wanted to learn from it. It's one of the reasons Germany is still synonymous with excellence, in spite of its history. Nevertheless, the Germans could as well learn from Latin America and be more relaxed and open in the face of improvisation. I have always been a big fan of Germany - of the culture, the people and the language. Slowly, I get this sense of being in a place where I am close to my friends, where I am able to start a family and at the same time, I have enough space to pursue my own development. Home, that's family. My family primarily consists of my mother and my sister. But I'm certain that everybody has two kinds of families. The one you are born into and the one you choose. Sometimes, you're not so lucky and they are not in the same place. That's why Berlin has also become a sort of home to me. When I think of Mexico, I think of this image showing the volcano Popocatépetl near Mexico City. It's still active. A volcano can be hot, it's powerful and can be violent, but it can also be quiet and radiate the tranquility of the Alps. Depending on the situation, this duality can beautify a landscape or subvert it into total chaos.
635	Mihir	India	United Kingdom	I	E	far	1931	40718	H	im	male	I came to the UK just 6 months after Enoch Powells Rivers of Blood speech. He said that coloured immigration was causing huge problems and that it would destroy the country. A constituent had told Powell, In this country in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man. Immigration then meant coloured immigration, from the subcontinent and the West Indies and many people were convinced it was fundamentally changing this country for the worse. Unlike the debate about immigration taking place now, then those against immigration made it very clear their objection to the newcomers was due to race. I wanted to become a journalist. Firstly, I started as a financial journalist. Also, I was football and cricket reporter for the Sunday Times on the weekends. I wrote about business in various business magazines and edited some of them. Then I became a full time sports journalist. Sports was fast becoming a business with a lot of money coming in and I started reporting on the business and politics of sport. Ive written 28 books, the first book was about cricket. I was also the first BBC sports editor. Occasionally after football matches I was physically threatened and once I thought my life was in danger. When I first became a sports journalist in 1974, people found my name difficult and I was often called Richard. I would have liked to have kept my Indian citizenship if it was possible. I feel Indian but I feel British, too. This is a duality. UK is my main home, India is my former home. India has surprised the world but is still not totally confident of exploiting its unexpected success. And the UK has done brilliantly to transform itself from a huge empire to once again becoming a small island but which still carries a lot of weight. I think this country hasnt given itself enough credit for this remarkable feat, almost unmatched in world history. What saddens me is that all the talk about immigration in this country is only about economics. A lot of people come to this country for economic reasons. I didnt come here to make money. I followed my dreams to become a journalist. I wanted to be a writer in London and I succeeded.  I have won some prizes and Ive just been given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Asian Cricket Awards.
636	Michael	Denmark	Switzerland	E	E	close	61477	86919	E	im	male	"Michael Moller is the Director General of United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG). He describes himself as a perpetual migrant – He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, and has been moving since he was five years old. Home is where my pillow is. I dont miss anything about my home. I dont miss places, I miss people. I miss friends and family whenever theyre not around, but I travel a lot and I still make sure to keep up with most of them whenever I can. For me it is about getting to know the country where you move to, its people, its habits, and its customs. Seeing new places; making new friends understanding new cultures. Moving is an adventure. For those who do it because they can, it is obviously a pleasant adventure. For those who do it because they must, it is not always the case. But it is always something that brings new surprises that broaden your horizon, which gives you new inputs and new things to think about, that enrich your life, particularly through the people that you meet during your journey. Some time ago, I spent several months in China, to learn Chinese and about the country. When you grow up in the west, from a young age you are fed with preconceived ideas, stereotypes and prejudices about others around the world. When you actually meet those others, all of those prejudices and stereotypes fall apart and you realize you didnt see these people for who they actually are. You also realize how similar they are to you. In todays world, the narrative about migrants and migration, refugees, asylum seekers is unnecessarily negative. The arrival of migrants into a society – wherever it is – is a positive thing both in terms of enriching local culture but also economically in most cases in the long term. In many parts of the world, particularly in developed economies where the birth rate is a negative one, migration is a necessity. There is great need to change the narrative and make it a positive one. All statistics show that migration is a good thing."
637	Michael	Eritrea	Switzerland	A	E	far	588	86919	H	im	male	Before I decided to leave my country, I had problems with the army. I went to jail because I was caught praying. Thats how I decided to leave Eritrea and go to Sudan. I had a job there but it was very complicated. I left for Libya with two good friends and on the way, while we were crossing the desert on trucks, my best friend died in a crash. We continued our journey towards the coast to cross the Mediterranean. We waited for departure in a house and some of the people we found there, had been there for months. We finally got on a small overcrowded boat. The trip lasted two days. I try to forget about it. I lost my second friend during this journey. But thanks to God, I made it. I arrived in Italy where I met a few persons I knew. They described their living conditions and I realized there were the same as in my country. You know, I had to stop my studies in Eritrea because I went to jail. I left my country with the hope of finishing my studies, in peace. When I saw how my friends were living in Italy, I realized I could not stay there and study. Thats the reason why I decided to take the train and come to Switzerland, without knowing where to go. I got caught by the police. After one year and 3 months, my asylum request was rejected whereas all my friends were granted. I could not believe it. After many twists and turns I was sent to Italy but came back to Switzerland. God be praised, I found the Refuge where people look after me. I have French classes almost every day and I dont feel chased by the police. I really hope my brothers and sisters from Eritrea receive the same protection one day. You know, I buried two of my friends on this journey. Sometimes I ask myself, why us? Why go through this? I suppose I just need to be patient. A time will come when itll be different. I have hope.
638	Michael	South Sudan	Uganda	A	A	close	1421	846	E	im	male	My name is Michael. I was born in Werkok village in Bor county, Jonglei state, in what is now South Sudan, in 1984. Before leaving South Sudan, I was working at a Government hospital in Bor town as a nursing assistant. These days, I am the chairman of Ayilo refugee village in the Adjumani refugee settlement in northwest Uganda. My family and I left South Sudan on 19 December 2013, a day after fighting broke out in Bor county. I came with 11 family members including my wife, Ayen Anyang Alier, and my four children – Mach, Chol, Mangol and Abuk aged between four and eight. We left Jonglei because there was violence. Soldiers were shooting people and our neighbours were fleeing and running away. It was not safe to stay. I didnt even have time to give notice at the hospital that I was leaving. We took a decision to move in just a day and then departed in the night. One of my children, 1-year-old Alier, was killed as we left Bor town. He was shot while being carried in my wifes arms, and my uncle was killed in the same attack. We used to own livestock but had to leave them behind. We had goats and cattle. All we could carry was a mosquito net, some clothes, a blanket, money and food. We also packed some sorghum and beans as we needed to eat on the way. We walked from Bor town to the River Nile, crossed it by boat and settled on its bank in the neighbouring state. We stayed there for ten days as we couldnt move immediately – we needed to monitor the routes and asked people if it was safe to move. When we ran out of food on the river bank, we had to buy some fish from local people. Eventually we got onto an open truck which took us south to the capital, Juba. I barely had any money by then and I pleaded with a truck owner to help us and take us anyway. It took us two days to reach Juba and all the while we were living in fear because there was fighting throughout much of South Sudan. I remember the sun hitting us hard on the truck. We had no water and no food. From Juba, we travelled on foot through to Nimule, then up to the Elegu border post in Uganda. We arrived in Uganda a month after departing Bor town. We arrived late in the evening and we were received well by UNHCR and the Lutheran World Federation. There was food provided by the World Food Programme. This gave us a soft landing. We like it here in Uganda. We are safe, there is no war, our children go to school, we have access to health care and we receive food. The food is very important. It helps us to manage our home. We receive it in time and there is a ration for each family member. We have enough for morning and evening meals. The children especially like the beans. I would have liked to finish my nursing studies but I dont see any such opportunity in the near future. The health centres here say that I lack the minimum qualifications and so I cannot work in Uganda. But I am very keen on farming and cultivating maize and vegetables. I would like to farm on a large scale and even take food to the market. It would be nice if we could form a group and market our grain together.
639	Michele	Italy	Switzerland	E	E	close	31238	86919	E	im	female	I am Italian, but also Swedish, and therefore, in a sense, twice a migrant. I first crossed a border at the age of two weeks, and have been on the move ever since - in Europe, in Oceania, in America, in Africa, and in Asia. I wonder if this make me a permanent migrant - meaning that the normally transitory experience of migration has become a constant for me. To migrate across borders is to be a pioneer, to bring oneself into new territory: the future. With each successive crossing of borders you have to decide what you will bring to the new country, and what you will leave behind. Youll also be confronted with new realities. The otherness of these realities can be shocking, wonderful, curious, but whatever they are they are never easy. You are out of your comfort zone, and that is where the real learning takes place, about yourself, and about other people and cultures: outside your comfort zone.
640	Michelle	Fiji	United States	O	N	far	5013	63123	H	im	female	When I first moved to the United States from Fiji, the biggest culture shock I had was realizing that peoples lives revolved around a timetable. Dinner was set at a specific time, homework was set at a specific time, and meeting with family was set at a specific time. This was not the norm for me especially coming from an island culture where hanging out with someone occurred spontaneously rather than on a schedule. For my family, the transition from Fiji to the United States was difficult. We had no idea how to access healthcare, find a job, or even enroll into school. For my parents, it seemed as if they were starting their whole lives from scratch, as if they were a child trying to learn to walk for the first time. For me, my burdens werent as heavy as the ones my parents were carrying. Their first jobs in the States were transitional jobs which provided the most basic needs for our family-food and shelter. They were and still are the true heroes of my story. Growing up, I rarely ever thought about the fact that I am a migrant, until I went to college. For the first time in my life I had no idea who I was. I somehow felt I had to learn everything again. I didnt know how to maneuver through the education system and instantly felt out of place. What helped me integrate into college was learning from those individuals who struggled in the same ways I did. It was encouraging being surrounded by people who were willing to beat the odds, surpass all stereotypes, and simply succeed just to prove to themselves that they were/are more than good enough. Through all of this, I learned that my upbringing paved a way that led me directly towards assisting others in their migration journey. What I loved about Fiji was my community. I miss being surrounded by a community that knows me inside and out. Fiji was that for me. People constantly ask me Where is home for you? but its such a difficult question. I think for me, Fiji laid out the basic foundations of my identity while California molded me into the person I currently am. Who says you have to have one place you call home?
641	Mika	Bangladesh	Italy	I	E	far	2001	31238	H	im	female	Mika, age 35, arrived in Italy five years ago from Bangladesh, and actually came to Rome on a flight in search of work for a better life. He now works alongside other Romans in the outdoor food market in Piazza San Cosimato in Trastevere, selling food products, such as pasta, olive oil, spices and after dinner liquors, mostly from southern Italy. He is well versed in their ingredients, origins in Puglia and preparation process. He is there every day and feels good about the life he has created here. Migrants from Bangladesh are on nearly on every corner in the center of Rome. They work in alimentari (small grocery shops), trinket shops, restaurants or in outdoor markets like Mika does. Some walk around the city selling hand held gadgets, umbrellas or jewelry. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) the stabilization of the Bangladeshi population is ongoing and as of 2016, nearly 54 percent of the 142,403 Bangladeshi migrants in the country hold EU long term residence permits. Although my name is Mika, in Italy my name is Michele, he says, adding  I am a migrant and I work in Rome. He attended Italian language school when he first arrived and lives near the Piazza with several other workers from Bangladesh in a three-bedroom apartment. One stall away is one of his compatriots who is still learning Italian. His Roman co-worker corrects his grammar as he loads mandarins into a basket.

During their early years, Alice never finished primary school while he went on to high school but did not complete his studies either. It is common here in the village for people not to finish their studies. Located in Oro province, the small coastal town of Killerton consists largely of rural villagers who live off their ancestral land utilizing the knowledge passed down from their forefathers, including how to survive natural hazards. Mike went on to join a theatre company as an actor and travelled throughout the country performing educational plays highlighting HIV/AIDS, immunization, and abuse against women. Domestic violence is a wide spread issue in this country. You will find cases of it in nearly every province and the plays would explain to people why it is wrong. His village was also severely damaged by cyclone Guba induced floods in 2007. When the flood came through our village, we decided to move our home away from its path. A couple of men in the village helped me to cut my house in half and we moved it away from the path of the flooding. In about two hours we were able to move my home 200 meters. We still live in the same home. Today, Mike continues to live in his home in Killerton with his family despite the continued risk of cyclones and flooding. Like most people from PNG, he has a strong connection with the land on which he grew up. I grew up on this land and so did my father and his father before him and so will my children and their children. This land is more than just our home; we hunt, grow food, build homes, and raise our families here. I was born here and I will be buried here alongside my ancestors."
643	Mikheil	Georgia	Ukraine	I	E	far	3984	3557	E	im	male	"I was a successful ballet dancer in Georgia, but when I realized that I wanted to become a conductor of an orchestra, I knew I had to leave. The conservatory I was at in Georgia did not offer this specialization at the time. I was no stranger to travel, but I knew that this time it would be different – I was planning on leaving for good, and I had to plan everything ahead. I believe that the success of my emigration was due to good planning. First, I had to choose the right place to master this complex profession, and then I had to select a country for which I had the right language skills. I had to think about the funding opportunities and a place to stay. With all this in mind I chose Ukraine. I joined the National Music Academy of Ukraine and became a student of the great Roman Kofman. No matter how well you prepare, still there are many hardships to overcome in a foreign country: documents, finances, new culture, mentality, lifestyle, you name it. But Ukraine turned out to be a very tolerant country, with people that are especially kind towards migrants. I started learning the language and very soon I made many friends. I never feel isolated in Ukraine. I even met my wife here and now we have a one-year-old son. I am quite happy with my life. I even lead my own chamber ensemble now – Armonia Ludus. But my connection to Georgia is stronger than ever – I participate in many concerts and international festivals that are organized in Georgia; I maintain close relations with Georgian diaspora in Ukraine, which helps me overcome the nostalgic feelings that I often get when I think about my country."
644	Miladin	Montenegro	Switzerland	E	E	close	7626	86919	H	im	male	I was born in Sarajevo, the capital of the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was at the time part of Yugoslavia. When I was 11 years old, a war started in my home city and my family fled to Podgorica, the capital of the neighboring Republic of Montenegro. We never returned to live in Sarajevo, we made Podgorica our home. I migrated again when I was 18, but this time willingly, after receiving a scholarship to study at the American university in Bulgaria. I studied political science and international relations. In the next seven years, I studied, did internships and worked in different countries including Bulgaria, Italy, Austria, United States, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2006, I returned to the newly independent Montenegro and started to work for the ministry of foreign affairs, where I spent almost four years. Then the time to move came again. I opened a new page in my life when I accepted a job offer by the United Nations interim force in Lebanon, the peacekeeping mission in the south of the country. I spent three amazing years in the Middle East, learning a lot about that complex region and meeting many amazing people. From Lebanon I moved to Geneva, where I currently work as a public information officer for the United Nations. I don't know when my next move will happen and where it will take me but I am open to new challenges, new experiences and countries and parts of the world I have never seen before. The best thing about traveling and living in different countries is acquiring new experiences. Moving is a unique adventure, and one needs to approach it with an open mind and an open heart.
645	Milissa	United States	Italy	N	E	far	63123	31238	E	im	female	" I studied Art History in university and there was an opportunity for me to come over to Italy and study in Perugia. Then I found work as a professor and later on as a Foreign Service officer, although I chose not to serve in Italy because I realized that I wouldnt have enjoyed the country as much while dealing with Italian ministries as a diplomat. I did, however, serve in Norway, France and Brazil. The Norwegians really wanted to get to know who I was. It was very easy there, even dealing with the authorities and such - they are very direct. I worked in Norway in the early 80s. At that time it was a very homogenous society; I just visited it again recently and they say that a full 25% of people in Oslo are not Norwegian. I really saw it: migrants where everywhere and seemingly well integrated; but when I was there back then, there werent many migrants, so I was a novelty. When I was getting ready to retire from the Foreign Service, destiny stepped in and I reconnected with my husband – he is from Rome and I had met him when I was in Paris. So instead of retiring in Washington , and writing my book post-foreign service life, I moved to Rome to be with him and got married. I have a special link with this country. My first really good friends were Italian Americans, whose families were racist - theres no question about it. But I became fascinated with Italy because of the culture I experienced through knowing these people: they were very family-oriented, very warm. I wrote my book while living in Italy. Even as a child, I wanted to write it because I thought my family was noteworthy. My father became a civil rights attorney straight out of law school in the 1930s, long before Martin Luther King. The whole first half of the 20th century in the United States has been largely ignored in terms of civil rights activity and I wanted to do something about it. Now that I am in Italy I live a very charmed life. Walking down the street, interacting with all kinds of people, I have no problems. I would say 99% of my experience here has been positive. I show a lot of respect and I speak the language. That gets you a lot in Italy."
646	Mireille	Australia	Australia	O	O	close	55823	55823	E	hc	female	I was born in Australia of an Indian mother who came to Australia 45 years ago, when she met and married my father. A few decades later, I met my soon to be husband from Switzerland and so I too moved for love to Lucerne, in Switzerland. We had planned to live between countries, spending 2 or 3 years in each, but found this rather draining and difficult. After the first few months of excitement died down, I settled into a homesickness that lasted more than a year. I actually had a good job and so did my husband, we were well off, had a nice apartment, could travel, but I was not happy. I kept thinking about the things I missed in Perth, my hometown – the cafes, the weather, the beaches, my family and friends, the ease of communicating in my native language and even the loud drunks. I guess the biggest thing for me was feeling isolated, which is ironic because Perth is actually the most isolated city in the world and Luzern is in the middle of Europe! But I guess you always miss what you dont have, and the day came when I finally had to make the choice as to what I would miss most. Could I really leave Perth forever, have kids and settle in Switzerland? After two years, I decided to return. I am lucky that I had the choice. The majority of women in this world dont have the same options that I had – to return home divorced and still be a respected member of society and accepted by my family and friends, and to be able to work and to be paid well doing fulfilling work that I love and provide for myself. The world needs women like us who have options and who can help others who dont. Together we will rise. We have to release all that is holding us back which, all that is keeping us from stepping out and doing good in the world. I am now coaching women to be powerfully feminine and I show them how capable (and awesome) women are, everywhere. I believe that wherever you are living, you should commit fully to living in it by creating a life you love there. If you miss something from home – some feeling, a sense of community, friendship – you have to go out and actively seek it and create it. Usually it doesnt come knocking at your front door!
647	Miwa	Japan	Germany	I	E	far	39990	45909	E	im	female	I left Japan when I was 18. I lived in many countries but I started my journey in the United States because my mother wanted me to go there to study. I lived and studied for a few years in Oklahoma. In the centre of America people are not so exposed to diverse cultures. Its not like New York or California where different cultures connect. There are Black neighbourhoods, White neighbourhoods, and Asian ones that dont merge. I wanted to be part of the community, but I felt a sort of racial segregation. Later on I lived in Latin America for a year and half. There, people are more affectionate and they come and talk to you. It was easy to make friends because people were curious about me. When I came to Germany it wasnt like that. The culture here is more reserved. They do not start conversations with strangers on the street. It was hard in the beginning, but I have been here in Berlin for 8 months and Im getting used to it. I have been taking German classes for two months, but Im realizing that school is not for me. I learn new languages by just putting myself out there, by talking to people. Now I speak English, Portuguese, Spanish, German and Japanese. I am currently working as a waitress in a Spanish Hotel and I do Capoeira on my free time. I feel like I am performing Brazilian culture here in Berlin, and by doing that I am learning about Brazilian history, about the slaves that came to Brazil from Africa and what kind of pain they went through. Capoeira for me is a way to combine my interest in culture, sports, dance and music. What I like about Berlin is its diversity. There are many people from other countries, there are Asians, Latinos, Africans, everyone is here. There is also an Asian market, which is great since I havent been home for eight years and I really miss Japanese food. I had stayed in Japan I would not be the person I am today. I am thankful to my mother for sending me abroad.

Instead of ordering the bread from Athens, the local bakery has offered them the opportunity to make it themselves and then send it to the accommodation center twice per week. IOM staff supported the activity and facilitated the communication and collaboration between the migrants and the bakery. With the support of the European Commissions Civil Protection & Humanitarian Aid Operations Office, IOM is providing support to the Government of Greece in camp coordination and management. IOM teams assist the Camp Managers with the sites daily management and organization of activities and services. IOM Facility Coordinators and interpreters assist with day-to-day operation, follow up with maintenance needs/activities, organize and facilitate provision of other actors' services and coordinate with national authorities. Community Support workers ensure protection of vulnerable cases and empowerment of site residents to access local services and develop self-resilience. They build links with public structures/services, facilitate access and referrals to competent public services and promote community's participation and involvement to daily site activities (site coordination, self-governance, cleaning/maintenance, empowerment groups, awareness-raising on facilities' usage).
649	Mohamed	Sierra Leone	Niger	A	A	close	475	568	E	im	male	"I left Sierra Leone because I wanted to go to Italy. My friend told me to pass through Algeria first so we could make some money. On the way there, the driver sold us to some Arab men and took all of our valuables, including phones and personal documents. As soon as we reached Tamanrasset in Algeria, they put us in some sort of prison. The worst thing was that the prison was managed by fellow Africans who had bought us from Arabs. I was there for 15 days with no food or water, and there were more than 70 other people in the same room. The captors gave me a phone and wanted me to call my family, but my mother lives in a very small village - she doesnt even own a phone. One day, they brought in another group of migrants and among them was a man from Sierra Leone so we became friends. He had a friend that had been helped by IOM to go back to Sierra Leone, so he suggested we got in touch with them. It was the youth vigilantes in Algeria that rescued us. They had heard about the human trafficking situation in the region; they found us and set us free. They took us to the police station and told us to call our families so they could help us get back home. At the police station, there was a huge group of migrants, including plenty of women and children. We asked the police to call IOM, but they said we should do that once in Niger. We asked for a human rights volunteer to assist us, but the police officers said there was no such thing. They put us in a truck, took us past Assamaka, Niger and left us in the middle of nowhere. There were more than 200 people there from all over West Africa. A big group of Nigerians decided to head back to Assamaka, but we stayed. We were in the desert for the next 45 days. While there, I asked a soldier to let me make a phone call so I managed to get in touch with IOM. However, soon after, the authorities moved us to another area so we feared that IOM staff wouldnt be able to find us anymore. We walked and walked for days until we reached Assamaka again but once we got there, we saw the IOM staff. They had come to assist us. We told them everything that had happened and they took us to their centre in Arlit. After a week there, we came here, to the centre in Agadez. There are now more than 50 migrants here from that group. We couldnt be more grateful for the help."

She sent me to Europe after my brother was killed in Damascus last year. He was shot by soldiers. We were all living in a Palestinian refugee camp in the south of Damascus. We were given 24 hours to leave. I left with my parents but my brother stayed behind. All the 100 or so people that were still in the camp were gunned down. In September 2014 I left for Turkey. I stayed there less than a month and tried to arrange my journey to Italy. We were travelling in the sea for four days already when our boat started sinking. It was during the night and we couldnt see anything. The waves were really strong, throwing the boat from side to side. The engine had died and there was nothing I could hold myself to. I thought I would die. At that moment a big Greek ship came and rescued us all. Im 17 years old so they put me in a childrens home with other refugee kids. I want to finish the last year of high school and then go to university. I want to study computer engineering.
652	Mohamed	Syrian Arab Republic	Mauritania	M	A	far	890	1702	E	im	male	"I left Syria in 2011, two months after the war started. I lived in Al-Hajar al-Aswad, in the suburbs of Damascus, the capital city. We went to Lebanon with all my family; I found a job as a mechanic for offset printers. I had been in Lebanon for a few months when the company decided to open a book printing company in Mauritania and sent me here. It was not my choice to move again. Last year, they decided to close the company. I never received the allowances for housing, medical insurance that the management promised. My work is very specific and I was not able to find another job. In Mauritania, there are only two offset printers in the whole country. Before I lost my job, I liked my life in Mauritania, I had everything. Seven months ago, I opened the small restaurant in a garage to earn a little money. Some friends lent me some money but I have not been able to reimburse them and they are getting impatient.  Opening this restaurant was not a dream but I had no choice, we have to eat, I have to feed my children. I have six children, they are 16, 14, 10, 8, 5 and 3 years old. My eight year old son fell down from the roof once because he was playing there alone. My wife and I work from 8 am to midnight, 7 days a week. We do not have time to take care of our children and we hardly ever see them during the week because they are asleep when we get home. They stay home alone, eat bread with some vache qui rit (cheese). They have forgotten the taste of fruits, or of playing outside. My children did not go to school for the last two years. After many applications, UNHCR has eventually started paying for their school fees since the summer. I have not been able to pay my rent for four months and I received threats of expulsion. I had to sell everything in the apartment to be able to eat for a few weeks. There is nothing left in the apartment, nothing to sleep on or sit on, just mats and a TV for the children. I challenge you to come to my house and stay there for 10 minutes. One of my friends says it lacks oxygen. Since 2011, I have not seen my parents, brothers and sisters. For one year now, I have not been able to talk to the ones who stayed in Syria because there is no internet connection anymore. I miss the daily family gatherings, the culture of my country. We have never thought of going to another country because we need visas everywhere. My wife and some of my children do not have a valid passport anymore. We cannot leave Mauritania. I see no future here and we cannot continue living like this. My dream is that my children could go to a good school and that my wife could stay home and take care of them."
653	Mohamed Salah	Egypt	United Kingdom	A	E	far	3609	40718	H	im	male	Social media users in Egypt have reacted with pride as Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah became the first Egyptian footballer to be named the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year. He is only the second African footballer to win the award, after Leicester City's Algerian midfielder Riyad Mahrez in 2016. Salah, 25, has scored a 31 Premier League goals this season this season (equalling the 38-game-season record held by Luis Suarez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Alan Shearer) with three league games still remaining.In Egypt, his triumph was front page news and the hashtag the legend Mohamed Salah has been shared more than 25,000 times since the announcement as compatriots paid tribute to the player Liverpool fans christened the 'Egyptian king'. Egyptian actress Rasha Mahdi was among many to tweet an image of Salah as a pharaoh. Salah is a national icon in Egypt. Last year, the footballer's 95th-minute penalty against Congo secured a 2-1 victory which saw the Egyptian national team qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1990. Streets have been named in his honour, as well as a school in the city of Basyoun, while in January the footballer was received by Egypt's president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. President al-Sisi was first elected president in May 2014, close to a year after he removed his elected predecessor, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, in a coup. The Muslim Brotherhood is now banned in Egypt. But political groups on both sides were among those to offer their congratulations. Pro-state figures and Muslim Brotherhood supporters alike were quick to signal their support. Haytham Abokhalil, a pro-Muslim Brotherhood human rights activist, said Salah's award gives confidence to our youth that it can be the best if it has the appropriate possibilities and opportunities. To those sharing images of Salah's meeting with the Egyptian president, he said: whoever publishes photos of Sisi with captain Salah are a minority who wish to remain in the sick ward. Several official state bodies have issued statements congratulating Salah. A foreign ministry spokesman said that Salah was a source of national pride and happiness, and a true inspiration to the youth of Egypt and Africa.
654	Mohammad	Iran	Iran	M	M	close	11183	11183	E	hc	male	I used to work in the cell phone market, with not much income. It was a boring life everybody could have experienced. I was fed up with it and told myself I could do better. When I returned home in the evenings, my wife and I watched TV programmes showing the lives of people in Europe who always seemed to be happy and successful. I knew some Iranians from my place who were now living in Europe and I always admired them. Gradually, the picture in my head of ourselves going there became more and more vivid. Our future, our 5-year-old daughter's future, was in Europe. I would travel alone, and my wife and daughter would come over once everything was settled. The idea was to travel to Turkey and meet with a smuggler who was supposed to take us to Greece. Everything seemed easy and the smugglers reassured us the journey would be safe. When we reached Bodrum the weather was rainy and unsuitable to hit the sea. We waited for three days in a hostel. When it was finally time to move they told us to leave all our belongings behind since the boat was not big enough. When I saw the boat I was quite worried, to say the least. It was an inflatable boat, barely able to carry ten people and we were thirty-five. I must have been crazy, but once you reach a point of no return, you go anyway. After a short instruction by the smugglers, we took off. As soon as we hit the sea we could see them running away into the bush. My friend, who I had met the night before, was behind the help all the way up to Kos Island. The boat was very unstable. The condition in Athens weren't any better. The weather was so cold, and we didn't have a proper place to stay. After a long time of trudging through fields and mountains, with no proper food and a place to rest, we crossed Macedonia and Serbia till we reached Croatia. By that time I was suffering from a bad cold, and moral hit rock bottom. I was blaming myself all day for this misery. When I finally reached the Netherlands, I stayed in a reception centre. All the promises of freedom, welfare and opportunities had no meaning to me anymore. I understood that many Iranians here didn't have nice houses and good jobs at all. Many of them didn't even have a residence permit. After one year in the Netherlands, Mohammad decided to return to his family in Iran with the help of IOM's Return and Reintegration Programme.

The young couple is now relocating to Norway, together with their newborn baby, Gwaad. We got engaged in Syria and I left for Turkey, says Mohammad. A couple of weeks later, Maya joined me. We spent some time in Turkey, where we also got married and then we crossed to Greece, almost a year ago to the day. We arrived on the island of Lesbos and from there we travelled up north. However, by the time we got to Eidomeni, the border had closed. We came back to Athens and joined the EU Relocation Programme. Now, we are finally leaving for Norway. I dont want to depend on others to support my family, so as soon as we get there, I will learn the language and get a job. I really look forward to be part of the Norwegian society, to integrate. It is very important for me to complete my education says Maya. I will learn the language, finish school and hopefully, I will become a hairdresser, which is my dream! The young mother is holding tenderly her 3-month-old baby in her arms as she speaks. Only one thing scared me during our journey and it was the sea. It was so terrifying. Our boat run out of fuel in the middle of the sea. Thankfully, the Greek coast guard came and rescued us, I will never forget them. As soon as we arrived in Greece, we felt embraced by the Greek people. They showed us love, tenderness, they cared for us. Now, I can dream again. In our new home, I will work hard to have my own restaurant, I love cooking!, Mohammad says. Hes such an amazing cook!, Maya says proudly for her husband. You know, we come from Damascus and food is so special there!
656	Mohammed	Afghanistan	United States	I	N	far	508	63123	H	im	male	Mohammed was born a fighter, so hes not used to sitting still. For now, he has no choice. He came to the United States nine months ago with some clothes and a pile of yellowed newspaper clippings, photos and mementos collected from four decades in boxing. He left behind a wife and four children, a career as a boxing coach and a dream of helping women in Afghanistan aspire to something more than life as second-class citizens. After the fall of the Taliban, Sharif helped introduce dozens of Afghan women to boxing, eventually becoming the countrys national boxing coach and leading one fighter to the brink of the Olympics. Its a society where 50 percent of the population plays no part except sitting at home. It was considered kind of crazy for a woman to fight, he said with a chuckle. Mohammed made international headlines for the audacious undertaking, lacing up mitts to challenge the traditional Afghan notions of femininity and womanhood. Mohammeds fighters didnt have proper equipment, didnt have extensive training and didnt have much support. They had a coach, though, and at the time, a bit of hope. Nearly a decade after Mohammed started coaching young Afghan women, the successes are unclear, and the dangers feel as present as ever. Mohammed, 57, sleeps in the living room of a Leesburg apartment. He fled Kabul in January and has applied for asylum in the United States. He was once celebrated for his work with young Afghan women, but as the country unraveled and power shifted, Mohammed became scared for his life. Because of these monsters who I do not even consider human, I had to leave, he said. If he stayed, he was certain of his fate: Death was waiting for me 100 percent, he said.

I came in France for the first time in 2006… and it was truly love at first sight; I fell in love with the Parisian life, art, culture. And I felt a lot of love among the people here. While coming here, we bring know-how and skills that we put at the service of France. Sometimes it feels like some patients doubt our ability to treat them, but they are quickly reassured and they thank us warmly on their way out from the hospital! One day, one of my patients was staring at me, and she eventually asked me what my religion was. I replied her: Medicine is my religion. Us doctors, we take an oath. And the Hippocratic Oath is universal. I treat everybody. I ease peoples pain, no matter the color of the skin, the background or the religion."
658	Mohammed	Iraq	Estonia	M	E	far	4146	23106	H	im	male	Prior to moving to Estonia I was a security adviser for Mercy Corps and worked on projects at UNESCO in Iraq, but my work had taken me to different countries. I fill many hats while in Estonia but in my spare time I help people in need, especially foreigners. The resistance of locals towards foreigners is strong here, like a huge fence. When I first came to Estonia, I quickly saw how systematic people in Estonia are – they go from home to work, from work to home. It is very different from how it is in my home country. In the beginning I felt total isolation, especially in a small town. All of us foreigners have conflicts when we first arrive – how to defend our names, culture, nationality, religion etc. I have learned that theres no point to defend it all. Just represent who you are. When you are accepted, the whole package is accepted with you. A Community is a very important ground for foreigners to do any developments or contributions. When somebody is discriminatory towards me, which happens daily, defending myself will leave the impression of an aggressive Middle Eastern trying to attack an innocent Estonian, so my main protection in Estonia is my command of the Estonian language.  So even though some doors might be closed, there are always open windows. Because of the migration crisis in Europe, it seems the entire Muslim community is considered as refugees. Integration is two-sided. On the one hand, the Arabic community needs to be more integrated, volunteering, finding chances to be within the community. On the other hand, since the education of new comers is different from that of the Estonians, the Estonian community needs to work hard and be patient. I dont regret my experiences so far. I have learned a lot from the Estonian culture – preciseness to the point that one minute of tardiness is something to consider, to be systematic and realistic. I have also experienced another definition of real friendship and how to integrate in a new society.
659	Mohammed	Niger	Libya	A	A	close	568	4243	H	im	male	I came to Libya in 2011 when I was 22, looking for a decent job. I didnt want to steal or join any bad business, so I left Niger to meet a friend in Libya who has been here for a long time. He said he could help me find a job, so I went to Tripoli directly. I spent two days checking out the city and walking by the Corniche, looking at the sea for the first time in my. Even now, I still find it beautiful. I started working with a construction and tools company. But only a few days later, we heard that a revolution was in the making. And then we started to notice the uprising in the streets. No one was sure about whats going on, but we were asked to stay home. Then things started to calm down and gun shots were no longer heard. We went back to the company, but sales dropped to zero for a few weeks and lots of workers started to go home. I, myself, wanted a chance of a better life for me and my wife, who [was] still in Niamey. We have been married since 2008. So, I stayed. My wife called me two months after my arrival in Tripoli and told me she was pregnant. The work flow slowly started to improve but the lack of workers affected us. Sometimes, I would work alone until 2 a.m. and go back to the company by 10:30 a.m. It was hard and I was tired, but all pain was forgotten when I got my paycheck at the end of the month. And then all that pain would be happiness. I knew it was risky back then to walk home late at night, but nothing happened so I kept going home late. One night a car stopped, and some guys came out of it. They stopped me, asking for my papers. I didnt have my passport then, so they started asking me questions about where I'm from and what I was doing here. They took my phone and my money and let me go. The next day when went to work, we tried to report it. But back then under the circumstances, nothing could be done. Days passed, the revolution ended, and things got much better. Everything was becoming normal. I was saving money and would send some to my wife and our baby. In 2014, a big armed conflict took place in Tripoli and it no longer felt safe. So, I decided to go back home. It was great to see my wife and my daughter as she was almost three by then. I bought a piece of land close to my father's and built a small new house for my wife and child. A year passed, and I couldnt find a good job. So, I moved back to Tripoli and started working in the same field again. What I do takes physical effort, because I have to load the trucks with materials and tools. Thats why I go to work early, so I can help the customers with what they need. Then I put things in order. Since Im short, Im also fast – this is why people at the company call me Derya (shorty in a Libyan Arabic dialect). In 2016, I got married again in Libya to my second wife. She came from Niger and I waited for her at the airport. Im happy right now, as I have a good job and Im working on my savings. Im not sure when I will go back to Niger, but when I do, Im planning to have more than one business. I want to have a taxi, a big truck, a welding workshop and I want to build other buildings on my land and rent them.
660	Mohammed	Niger	Libya	A	A	close	568	4243	H	im	male	"A Plot of Land: Hope Restoration in Agadez Mohamed, Issouf, Moussa, and Aghali are members of communities that are affected by migration flows in Niger. A community stabilization project recently launched by IOM, the UN Migration Agency, is giving them and 26 other Nigeriens in Agadez reason to dream of a better future in their communities. The group of 30 is made up of returnees from Libya, ex migrant smugglers, and youth at risk; their lives are all guided by a mix of ambition, uncertainty, and most importantly hope. They are now looking to the agricultural sector for opportunities to improve their lives. When he talks about Libya, Mohamed, 45, speaks with the melancholic tone of a man who has seen better days. For Mohamed, things are simple: life is better when he doesnt have to worry about tomorrow. Life used to be beautiful in Libya. I could work for a day and feed myself for three, he says. Just as thousands of Nigeriens each year, Mohamed left for Libya in order to earn some money; his plan was to then come back home, feed his family, and do it all over again. The European dream was never his ambition. During his time abroad, Mohamed worked in a garage where Sudanese friends taught him how to weld. He came back to Niger in 2005 when the security situation in Libya started deteriorating, and tried finding a job back home. Back in Niger, he wanted to practice the craft he had learned in Libya, but when he took stock of the taxes he would have to pay and the lack of clients, he quickly realized that he needed to look for a different line of work. I left Niger over and over again, and I came back just as many times. Mohamed Since he came back, Mohamed has participated in a few small income-generating activities like selling camel milk, but steady work is elusive. I havent had a stable job since 87 when tourism was booming in Agadez and the Paris–Dakar Rally was popular, he says. Mohamed is one of the 30 Nigerien beneficiaries that have been selected by a designated committee of local leaders in Agadez, to participate in IOMs new community stabilization project. Supported by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the project focuses on migrant reintegration and on countering the radicalization in the region through the creation of jobs related to the restoration of degraded lands and their productive base. Each beneficiary has received from the authorities one hectare of land to use for income-generating activities. Vegetable farming is very much dependent on season, some seasons not being as profitable as others. With that in mind, and until the end of the project, each of them receives a monthly allowance of 60,000 FCFA. Like many of his compatriots, Mohamed has done his fair share of agricultural work over the course of his life — it is one of the main livelihood sources in Agadez — so he isnt worried about picking it up again, as long as it guarantees that he can put food on the table for his family. When Mohamed asked his future parents-in-law for their daughters hand in marriage, he promised he would take care of her. I intend to keep that promise, he says. On paper, Issouf, aged 24, meets the criteria for being considered a youth at risk: an unemployed person without formal education, aged 18–35 years old, who can barely find the means to feed himself and his family, but is willing to find a way whether through regular means or by engaging in criminal activities. While the risk is present, at first glance, Issouf strikes you as a young man who was raised to know better than to shame his parents by engaging in petty crime. Issoufs household, comprised of his parents, ten siblings, numerous aunts, nephews and nieces, is about three kilometers away from Agadez town. Together with Mohameds family and about 80 other families, they make up a very tight-knit community. Issouf takes any work he can get and often gardens with his father and brothers. His brother-in-law left for Libya a while back and never came back. It was no surprise, then, that Issouf jumped at the opportunity to take part in a new agricultural project when he heard unemployed youth in his village were being sought out. His parents were overcome with joy upon hearing that he had been selected and that he would have a stable income, which would allow him to support his extended family. At the end of the day, we all help each other out to make ends meet. Issouf The community stabilization project is not meant as a reconversion plan for ex-smugglers, but as an inclusive approach to engage all community members. The UNCCD project appeals to ex-smugglers like Moussa. Several years ago, the 48-year-old was approached by friends in the smuggling business who seemed to be doing well. Young and unemployed, Moussa decided to give it a shot and join their business. If there were migrants looking for a means of transportation, he was there to give them a lift. Little by little, the business expanded and so did his earnings. Ten years later, once the law n° 2015–36 (criminalizing the smuggling of migrants) started being implemented in Niger, he gave up the business. I used to gain a lot as a smuggler, but it wasnt worth the risk. Moussa Before he ever pictured himself as a smuggler, however, Moussa used to garden for a living. His entrepreneurial spirit shines through as he talks about his plans for the plot of land he was allocated through the project. He wants to cultivate not only vegetables, but also orange, mango and date trees. During the month of April, when the prices are lower for sheep, he aims to buy a few and build an enclosure for them on his plot of land. Later on he can sell them at a higher price. He often talks with the other beneficiaries about how they can make this land more lucrative for everyone. IOM staff in Niger help the beneficiaries make decisions about what to do with their plots of land and choose the right plants to cultivate if they want to start gardens. Cucurbits, announces Fiza, IOM Community Stabilization Assistant in Agadez. This is what they should be planting this season: cucumbers, pumpkins, watermelons. During the course of the project, each beneficiary will participate in an agricultural training and receive a seed kit appropriate for the current vegetable farming season. Once they start making a profit, they can diversify the products they cultivate. The obvious challenge to practicing agriculture in the middle of the desert is finding water. As Abdoul, 35, puts it: If there is no water, there is no work. With support from the local committee and providers, and following an in-depth feasibility study, the land has been leveled and the drilling has begun in the quest for water. Given that the newly designated plots of land will no longer benefit the herder community in the area, 200 hectares of land in the vicinity have also been restored. Because of Agadezs difficult terrain, more than 100,000 half-moons (water catchments) have been created to harvest and conserve rain water, and to create a favourable environment for plants. More than 150 people were engaged in cash-for-work activities during the rainy season to create the half-moons and to plant more than 60,000 trees. This newly created space and the water towers on the land are made available for use to all the four different villages in their surroundings. The project also aims to organize weekly trainings in agriculture for close to 500 West African migrants staying at IOMs transit centre in Agadez, as they wait for their travel documents to be ready. The migrants will be learning new skills on the land allotted to the UNCCD beneficiaries, and they can thus all interact not only on a professional level, but also on a personal one since many of them similar migratory experiences. Aghali, 25, used to earn his living as a motorcycle taxi driver in Agadez. When his bike was stolen, he decided that the only option was to leave for Libya. Once he arrived in Libya, he found a job in agriculture outside of the capital Tripoli. Since he barely got paid for his work, he went back to Tripoli where he got kidnapped and imprisoned for five months. He never called his parents to ask for money to pay the ransom because he didnt want to worry them. The kidnappings, the slavery, it was all too much to endure, so I came back. Aghali Aghali came back in 2017, but he still hasnt heard any news from the friends he left behind in prison. He has seven brothers and sisters, and shares an especially close bond with his brother Rhissa. Since he came back, Aghali hasnt been able to find a stable job. On a good day, he earns about four euros working on his neighbours land. While Aghali was away, Rhissa wanted to follow in his brothers footsteps and leave for Libya, but his parents feared for his future. Aghali now hopes that having a plot of land of his own and being able to work alongside his brother will lead to a positive new chapter in his life. The Community Stabilization Projet de réintégration des migrants et de lutte contre la radicalisation grâce à la céation demplois liés à la restauration des terres dégradées et de leur base productive is funded by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). IOMs Community Stabilization programme aims to support governments and civil society in reducing factors that lead to irregular and forced migration, integrating the needs of marginalized groups and host communities, and responding to the impact of migratory flows on communities."

While he did not make the initial cut for the team going to Rio, he still dreams of competing at that level in the future. I traveled alone from Mogadishu to Dadaab refugee camps in Kenya when I was 8 or 9 years old, Mohammed explained. In the beginning, I stayed with another family that looked after me, but they got resettled to the USA. He attended primary and secondary school in the camps, but left early in order to find work. In 2013, he and his wife, newly married, moved across Kenya to Kakuma refugee camp. They have three young children. He finds it difficult to support his family and worries about their safety while he trains full time in Nairobi. My family members are refugees back in the camp, I have to focus and train while I am here so they dont suffer, Mohammed continued. If I train and do well, then they will no longer be refugees. That is why I am doing it. When I run, I think of a lot of things, but mainly I think about how the most important thing is to change my family's life first. I also think about helping other people because when God helps you, you are supposed to help others. One day, if you become a celebrity, people will say, He was a refugee and he still made it. Mo Farah is my half brother, said Mohammed, referring to the famous Somali long distance runner who now runs for the UK. I hope to be as famous as him one day. Mohammed believes in the power of sports to change the lives of refugees. His determination and perseverance is evident on the track during each workout. When I become famous, I hope to motivate my fellow refugees, wherever they are. Instead of saying, we are refugees, I want us to say, we are the same as the others. We shouldnt think that we cant make it in life because we arent living in our own countries. We can achieve our goals whatever they may be. If your dream is football, then you have to focus and train and you too can make it. Running is not easy, but it is easy if your body accepts it. If you give up today, then you will give up tomorrow, and for the rest of your days you will constantly give up. But if instead of saying, let me die, you say let me try, then you will finish the race and you will feel stronger. If you continue to push yourself, you can see if you can become number one.
662	Mohammed	Sudan	South Sudan	A	A	close	1415	1421	E	im	male	"Mohammed is among the few non-South Sudanese residents at the United Nations protection of civilians site in Bentiu, South Sudan, where more than 120,000 internally displaced persons are seeking safety from a brutal civil war. Originally from Sudans Southern Kordofan State, Mohammed traveled to South Sudan in pursuit of economic opportunity in 2008. He made his living as a store owner in Bentiu town, the capital of South Sudans Unity State. A number of us from Sudan came here seven years ago to set up shops. I had a general store selling regular household items and business was going well in the beginning. This all changed when the civil war erupted in December 2013. When fighting broke out in Bentiu in early 2014, I didnt leave the town like the other Sudanese when the fighting had started, but eventually the market place was being attacked and my shop got destroyed. After that, I had nothing left. Forced to flee, Mohammed ran to the UN Mission in South Sudan peacekeeping base in Bentiu, along with thousands of South Sudanese seeking protection. After arriving there, I found out that most of the Sudanese businessmen who fled here had already managed to go back home. Left behind, Mohammed now lives in a shared shelter with other Sudanese nationals who were not able to find the means to go back. Im not married and I dont have a family here; it is not that I dont want to, but I dont have enough cattle to pay the dowry for a wedding. Even getting married is an expensive affair! laughs Mohammed. Nevertheless, he remains optimistic about his future. One day I would like to go back home. Maybe I will set up a shop or find a new job. I will. As soon as I get the opportunity to do so."

I used to work in construction, building and smoothing walls. I have done this all my life, since I was 15 years old. Before the war in my country, we used to come to Lebanon, but due to the ongoing situation in Syria, my family and I left Syria for good in 2013 and settled down here, in Lebanon. When we first arrived here, UNHCR supported us and gave us around $300 a month. Now we get less but fortunately, I have been able to work from time to time and do what I used to do before. Since I didnt have a proper ID, I couldnt always accept job offers and could not travel very far to work. Today, the lives of 13 people fit into one suitcase apiece.This is what life has become for us. A journey. I dont really know anything about Canada, but. Im not worried. Mohammed, his wife Widaad and their eleven children will be resettled to Canada which will eventually take in 25,000 Syrian refugees from Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt.

I am a Kurd and came from the Kurdish part of Syria.  Before the war, I was a taxi driver and a market vendor. But when the war came, I had to stop. No one had money to buy anything anymore. There are three types of people who leave Syria: people who run from joining the Syrian army, people who do not have enough food, and people who are afraid to die.  Me?  I guess Im all three.  They called my son up to join the army, so I ran with him.  There is no work for me in Syria so we had no food.  Syria is just too dangerous now. I have two grown up children.  All three of us came to Turkey a year ago. Here we just sit.  I cannot do anything. I cannot work. Thats why I want to go to Canada.  I know if my family comes with me, I would live a good life.  Its very cold, I hear, but Im ready for it.  I could be like an eskimo laughs Mohammed. Im 53 years old.  What more do I want out of life?  I want to live in safety and to live a respectful life.  What more is there?  I want to go to Canada and to live a normal life.

Since arriving in Turkey, Mohammed has been making an effort to learn the Turkish language as well as the local culture. If I am going to live here I figured I better start learning their language and how their culture is different from ours. Otherwise I will never fit in, explains Mohammed. He is among several on a tour, organized by IOM, in one of the famed Ottoman palaces in Istanbul alongside other Syrian refugees and host community members in order to promote social cohesion as well as give refugees a chance to discover and learn about the country that they live in.
666	Mohammed Ali	Tunisia	Bulgaria	A	E	far	3318	10058	E	im	male	"I moved from Tunis to Sofia as part of a student exchange programme between the universities of the two countries. Meanwhile I met my wife, got married and we started our family. That is how I decided to settle in Bulgaria. What I miss the most about Tunis are our traditional foods that cannot be found here. Also, I miss the sea. Bulgaria has a coast on the Black Sea but the city I live in, Sofia, is far from there. I lived very close to the coast in Tunis. But I'm fine and happy here. I feel at home. For me home is where I can be with my kids and family, thats why Bulgaria feels like home now. The cultures do not differ that much actually. Bulgaria lies on the border between the North and South, which is also the case for Tunisia. of course, since the language is different this led to some funny moments. For example, on one of my first days here, I looked at a commercial sign that said in Latin letters restaurant; but then there was a sign that said something like pectopaht, which I could not figure out the meaning of. I was looking for a restaurant and there were only pectopaht! It was only later when I studied the Bulgarian language that I realized this was the same word but written in Cyrillic (ресторант). My field of work is masonry - everything that has to do with the processing of stone to the actual trade of the products. The renovation of the drinking fountain, a national cultural monument, across from the Central Sofia Market Hall (known as Hallite) is one of the projects the company I work for sponsored. We renovated part of the fountain and all of the sponsors names are engraved in it. I'm proud to say that i participate in renovating Bulgaria's national monuments."

From Syria, we crossed the border to Turkey, where we spent two months before arriving on the island of Chios. Very soon, we settled in Athens, in a central hotel. Before the war broke in Syria, I was a professional cameraman, filming videos for weddings, receptions and the like. My wife, Nahed, didnt work as she took up the upbringing of our two, very young, children. Her younger siblings, Mohammed and Amani were still going to school. We found out that we will relocate to Germany, a fact that made us really happy, since my brother is already living there, in Berlin. As soon as we get to Germany, wed like to assess the situation first, to understand it. Our main priority is to get our children to school. As for us, we must learn the German language and get a job.

668	Moises	Mozambique	South Africa	A	A	close	449	5094	H	im	male	"I am a descendent of a migrant worker who, in 1927, travelled by foot from Mozambique to work in the mines of South Africa. Among ten brothers, of whom I am the youngest, six also worked as miners in South Africa. Labour migration to South Africa became a common practise for the youth of Mozambique who utilized it as a means to produce revenue in order to pay for a dowry known as lobola. As my father and brothers before me, I also made the journey to South Africas mines. The main challenges were to adapt to the life in the hostels and the language barriers. Work in the mining industry is the heaviest I have ever experienced. The length of the work contract (twelve months) took me away from the family and this was the saddest feeling I had experienced. The conditions I lived in at that time were the worst part of my life to date. In the mining industry the migrant workers main challenge is the single-quarters life that keeps miners away from their families; the portability and access to social security benefits for migrant workers; and lack of information regarding miners rights. Adaptation to the local reality is another challenge. In some cases the migrant workers face xenophobia. Being a migrant worker in South Africa, the National Trade Unions in Mozambique could not assist us legally, and the National Unions in South Africa could not extend their assistance to Mozambican migrant workers due to legislation barriers. Moreover, the issues of access of migrant miners to health and social benefits were not fully addressed. Migration has had an impact on my life, broadening my horizons, views and decisions. It allowed me to meet new people, experience different cultures and ideas which ultimately led to the foundation of Association of the Mozambican Mine Workers (AMIMO) and Southern Africa Miners Association (SAMA). At the family level, migration has cost me the loss of my first marriage. However, I did not look back to the consequences this had on my life and moved on, defending miners rights. Moises is the president of the AMIMO. "
669	Monica	Romania	Thailand	E	I	far	12929	7189	E	im	female	"When I turned seven, I went to France for a year. My mom was on a scholarship while working as an architect. The first year she left by herself, the following year she took my sister while I stayed back with my dad, and the third year she took me as well. I didnt speak a word of French, but by the end of the year I was at the top of my class. We all adapted very well and it felt as though I had been living there my whole life. My dad came to visit a couple of times, but I dont think he ever fully adapted since he couldnt speak the language very well. Despite my moms best efforts, at the end of the year we went back to Romania. A few years later, I left home to pursue a masters degree in Spain. I went there somewhat fearful and expected to find a fair amount of criticism and discrimination towards Romanians, but I was glad to encounter mostly warm and welcoming people. However, my experience in Spain was the time in my life that I have felt most like a migrant. When you have a big migrant population of any kind in any country and you are part of it, you will constantly be reminded where you come from. Since then, Ive travelled and worked in South Africa, DR Congo, Madagascar and Thailand, and Ive felt quite anonymous. Most people dont have the faintest idea where Romania is and that can be quite a blessing at times. People at home often ask me how I can just pick up and leave and travel by myself, but I wouldnt have it any other way. Being on your own teaches you how to rely on yourself and most importantly, how to be happy with yourself. Its hard to admit that I still get some anxiety when people ask me where Im from. The answer always comes with a lot of baggage, usually filled with stereotypes, prejudice and misconceptions. Its exhausting to always have to prove yourself. But contrary to popular belief, I didnt leave because I hated it; I left because I was tired of living in my comfortable bubble and wanted to grow as a person – and I dont think Ill ever stop wanting that."

After he died, I didnt have any means to support my family so I decided to go to Algeria. I sold everything I had and at 38 years old, I left all by myself. Life was not that easy there. I worked in a restaurant for a while until I decided to go back. I gained a bit of money, but used most of it for transport to get back home. We have IOM in Cameroon as well, but it didnt cross my mind to contact them here until I met my fellow Cameroonians at the bus station. I left my two daughters, 10 and 17, back in Cameroon with my mother. My mom can get by and buy the daily bread, but thats about it. I dont have any brothers or sisters either so my family relies on me for support. I used to send them money all the time from Algeria. I fought hard so my girls could stay in school. Everything I earned, I saved so I could pay their school fees. School comes first. My little one wants to join the military when she grows up, but I dont approve that, and the oldest one wants to keep studying. My biggest dream is to see my girls grow up. I always call my mum to talk to my daughters, and she always tells me that I need to work hard, that there is nothing to do at home. People usually say that if you leave your country, you gain some money to feed your family, and its true. But I miss my girls so much. I dont regret leaving, but I am very happy to go back. The hardest thing I had to go through in my life was my husband's death. I never want to remarry. I loved him dearly, he was the father of my kids. When I get back, Ill see how things go, and maybe if I get a bit of money, Ill open my own shop. Ill try to make it, but its hard. I often feel alone in this world.

When the strikes also reached that household, they found another shelter that they had to share with 45 other people. In this area, she suffered from how people looked at them only because they were displaced. At the beginning, her new neighbors did not want to interact with her family. We were nothing.

With the large concentration of Arab Americans and Syrian expats in Michigan, I have been engaged in the community through organizations like the National Arab American Medical Association (NAAMA) and the Arab Community Center for Social and Economic Services (ACCESS). The humanitarian and charitable objectives that NAAMA provided enticed me to explore opportunities of benefiting my homeland as an expat. This resulted in many community projects and efforts and a major study in 2004 where I conducted the first clinical study ever to assess the growth and living conditions of Palestinian children living in refugee camps in Lebanon. I am still involved in NAAMA and contribute to the planning of humanitarian missions in Syrian refugee camps as well as issues related to the resettlement of immigrants and refugees. I am a firm believer that expats play a major role in the restructuring of health systems and public infrastructure of their home countries both in the times of war and peace."

Victims of Trafficking Start Over in Mauritania Since 2015 IOM, the UN Migration Agency has been assisting victims of human trafficking in Mauritania. Sahel populations have always been very mobile, but in recent years a complex economic situation and the difficulty of finding jobs has pushed more and more people to seek jobs abroad. Unscrupulous traffickers seize on this desperation by promising men and women well-paid stable jobs away from home. Instead, these migrants wind up working under inhumane conditions for families who cannot protect their interests and do not care about their well-being. Deprivation, humiliation, hardship, restricted movement, and limited communication with their families become the new norm for those who excitedly embarked on an adventure, with hopes of a brighter future. Mouna* is a mother in her thirties. She relocated to one of the Gulf nations with help from a hiring agency that had promised her a secretary position at the ministry of foreign affairs and a monthly salary of four hundred dollars. Once she had reached her destination, she was forced to work as a maid and babysitter for a family. One day, Mouna fell ill; in order to avoid paying the hospital bills, her employer abandoned her on the streets and claimed that she had run away. I never planned to migrate, I never wanted to leave my children [behind], but it was my destiny, she later said of her ordeal Everything is written! Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident; too many optimistic economic migrants around the world experience ordeals similar to Mounas every year. Misled by false promises, countless individuals find themselves trapped in critical and precarious vulnerable situations. Tate, a 29 year-old mother of three, was also trapped by the promise of work. A so-called hiring agent, like many others, took advantage of economic migration inflows to develop a network. I was sold out, exploited, Tate recalled. The same hiring agent asked me to help him recruit new girls. I rejected his request! Those were the darkest days of my life, and I do not wish that on anyone else. Rama*, 29, once met a handsome, charming man called Ali. He was a so-called hiring agent for a recruitment agency; these groups are often instrumental in convincing migrants to travel abroad for work and they charge for their job placement services. He made me believe in Eldorado, a world that does not exist, she said of her encounter with the man who would lead her down a dangerous path. I found nothing but pain and illusions. Sometimes these journeys end well for the migrants that undertake them, so news of economic opportunities abroad often spreads via word of mouth, but there are often many rumours and uninformed claims involved. But equally often, the idea of migrating to a foreign country comes from loved ones. CTDC data show that more female victims of trafficking are recruited by their intimate partners, family, relatives, or friends than male victims. Investing in someone who will help provide for the family is a custom in many communities where trafficking is prevalent. Nasra, a 34-year-old mother of six, never wanted to migrate, but she bowed to pressure from people around her. I was strongly encouraged to leave, she said. I was homesick, and suffered racial discrimination and unfair treatment in an environment that I thought would be free of bias, free of injustice and full of opportunity. Migrating was never part of my life plan, my familys advice and my husbands death influenced my decision, she continued. I had to find a way to survive and provide for my children. Unfortunately, when journeys like Nasras are unsuccessful and the migrants return home empty-handed — if they return at all — many of them are left helpless and abandoned by the same family members that pushed them to leave. The resulting to rejection and judgment of an unsuccessful migration attempt can make the reintegration process an uneasy or indeed impossible experience. Most migrants spend all of their savings to leave home, and many are left without resources on their return. IOM put a reintegration programme in place to support vulnerable migrants like these. Upon their arrival in Mauritania, Mouna, Tate, Rama and Nasry were able to take part in this programme, along with 95 other women. They were given psychosocial and medical assistance through IOMs programme, and received financial support to start income-generating activities. Today, Rama runs a small business. She designs and creates womens accessories and beauty products, which she supplies to wholesalers and exhibits during traditional wedding ceremonies. Her family was also a great source of support to help her regain her standing within the community. Together with my brothers and sisters, we were able to renovate our two houses and purchase a third one, she explained My brother is a fisherman; with his help we are able to meet our day-to-day needs with dignity. After going through difficult plights, the women are independent and can meet their familys needs. They were able to rediscover their sense of belonging, regain respect within their societies and start supporting their own livelihoods. Mouna runs a ladies shop with expanding clients and growing demand for her products. I never thought I would be able to start-up a business on my own, she said. IOM helped me rebuild my confidence and I am grateful, from the depth of my heart. For these women, sharing their stories empowers them and helps raise awareness of human trafficking while providing resilience strategies for those who have already fallen victim to this horrible crime."
675	Mourad	Morocco	France	A	E	far	3108	38959	H	im	male	"My parents came from Morocco in December 1980. My father, after spending years working hard in France, decided to return to Morocco fifteen years ago. As for me, I was born and grew up in Lyon. I arrived two years ago in Paris, for work. Back then, my father was seen as a respectable man, as a diligent worker. He never felt any racism here. But nowadays everything has changed. Even though we have a job and a comfortable situation, people still look at us in a different way. Because we look less French than others. I think that both media and politicians contributed to this change of behavior towards migrants and migrants children. And we have very few means to defend ourselves against these discourses. There is no one to make our voice heard; I mean us, the so-called second generation.  We can only change things at the political level. Of course, at my level I try to change our image, I also try to help those arriving in France. I volunteer in a local association where I participate to night-time rounds every Friday to identify and assist the most vulnerable people living in the street. But without the support of politicians, these efforts sometimes seem vain. I often return to Morocco, to Casablanca. And it just reminds me Paris, it is a big city as well! Things are not that different there, except that there is the sea and the beach! In Paris I like the two co-existing worlds: Paris by day and Paris by night, that convey different energies. I always feel that my soul is somehow split, between Lyon where I was born and Paris where I live, between Morocco which is my country of origin and France which is my country of birth, where I grew up, where I feel home. Actually, I am three-half, half-Lyonnais, half-Parisian, and half-Moroccan! It is all a matter of finding a proper balance. When I go to Casablanca, I am also being called the immigrant. It is a bit frustrating; it can even be hurtful… Because my identity is also questioned here in France. But now I try to simply ignore this kind of comments. I do not want to force anyone to accept me; we just have to live together, should it be in Paris or in Casablanca!"

Eleven years is a long time. During those years I was angry and irritable. When I made the decision to return, I found peace of mind. I bought six goats with my reintegration grant. The deal was sealed with a handshake, which is how we do business in my country. A salesman does not give you a receipt if you purchase something; a handshake is enough. We Nigeriens keep our word. However, we did take a photo of the deal to prove it. My business consists of buying goats, fattening them up, and selling them again. It is a decent business, and my bargaining expertise is key to my success. I only buy healthy goats, and my customers know they can trust the quality of my selection. I do not want to migrate again. Now that I earn a stable income I prefer to stay with my family. They are good to me."
677	Moussa	Niger	Senegal	A	A	close	568	1458	E	im	male	I came to Dakar, Senegal in 2006 to take up an internship with the Mouvement Africain des Enfants et Jeunes Travailleurs (MAEJT). I initially planned to stay for 6 months but that became another 6 months and now I am still here working for them. I was born and raised in Niamey, Niger. My father is Malian and my mother comes from Niger. I have moved a few times in my life. When I was 8 years old my parents sent me to Agadez in the north of Niger, where I lived there with my sister and her husband for 4 years. I liked it over there and if it wasnt for her I wouldnt have gone to school — she helped me a lot. Due to our circumstances I couldnt stay with her and returned to my mother in Niamey. My father was gone. I still dont know what happened… My family is pure blood Nigerien. We dont let anyone sit back and let their life go to waste. My mum convinced me to pick up my studies or training so I started learning to be a carpenter. During those studies I got in touch with Caritas and the NGO Environment Development Action in the third world (ENDA). They visited one of the CARITAS workshops I was attending. They must have noticed that I was still young but very driven. I think they also saw I needed more guidance in order to develop my skills and so they put me in touch with MAEJT in Niger. This organisation informs children of their rights, helps them to battle poverty and creates a network of fraternity among African youth. First I started volunteering with a lot of passion. I found something that I liked and that I was good at: coordinating and helping at the same time. Soon I participated in their training programs and then the big moment arrived: they asked me if I wanted to do an internship for 6 months in Dakar. Of course, I said yes. I arrived in Dakar and moved in with a Senegalese host family. I had difficulties adapting at first, their lifestyle was different than mine. They like to get dressed up, and they dress well! They like to dream and they dont give up, even when they dont succeed. I admire that. One thing the Senegalese can learn from us is to waste less food. If a Senegalese person sees a rotten tomato he throws it away. In Niger, we keep it, cut out the bad parts, dry the rest and use it as food or sell it. We dont let anything go to waste! I have lived in Coeur Massar, close to Dakar, for 11 years now. I go back to Niger every year. I love my country and I like my work here in Senegal. I often compare the people of my home country to camels: endurance, always finding a solution and often on the move. The Senegalese are like lions: proud, graceful and full of energy. Except when it is too hot.
678	Muhammed and Haneen	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	n	We are from the same town in Syria, but we never met before the war. When the fighting started our families moved to the same neighborhood.  We instantly fell in love with each other. That was two years ago. Somehow war brought us together.   We didnt have a party for the wedding.  ISIS ruled our town and it was forbidden to organize any noisy event.  If you did have a gathering, it had to be very quiet and locked in the house. It was dangerous. So we didnt have a party. This was very hard on Haneen.  Even now, every time she sees a wedding on TV or a wedding dress, she gets really upset. We had to leave Syria because there was nothing left where we are from. No home. No work.  No hope. The town is ruled by ISIS.  So we moved to Turkey with our family and they decided to take a boat to Greece, and then went to Germany.  As we didnt have money to pay the smugglers, we stayed in Turkey, but, this was for the best because we are going to Canada.  Im glad we didnt take the boat.  Now, my family in Germany wishes they were moving to Canada with us. One of the priorities I have now? Once we arrive in Canada, I want to have a wedding party for my wife. All I want is to make her happy, and that would really make her happy.
679	Murad	Afghanistan	United Kingdom	I	E	far	508	40718	H	im	male	I arrived in the UK at the age of 14, following some terrible and traumatic personal experiences that no person, let alone a young child, should ever have to go through. My father and uncle were both Police Officers with the Afghanistan National Police - this led to them being murdered by the Taliban in front of me. Deciding that it was not safe for me to stay in Afghanistan, I fled to the UK, arriving here in the back of a lorry and immediately, and legally, seeking asylum - which was accepted on a temporary basis until I turned 18. I have no surviving family that I am aware of. I have made an incredible journey during my time in the UK. I have been recognised both locally and nationally for my volunteer work, my support for other children in Foster Care and for my dedication to bettering myself. I regularly volunteer with Suffolk County Council and the local Rotary Club. Perhaps most impressively, I was one of only 20 young people chosen to be part of the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust's 'Unlocking Potential' Mentoring Scheme. This was designed to allow young people who have overcome a challenging background to increase their self-confidence. As part of the scheme I was mentored by Olympic swimmer Ross Davenport and organised a charity cricket day. I chose for all the proceeds from this event to go to a charity that works with disadvantaged communities in Norfolk and Suffolk. The reasons why I chose to flee Afghanistan are the very reasons why I hope to be allowed to stay in the UK. I would be just as vulnerable, if I were returned there, as I was when I left. The only life that is on offer to me there is one of danger and of hiding. There is no doubt that, should I be allowed to continue to call the UK my home, I would do my very best to go on to become an outstanding adult member of the British community.

680	Murad and his family	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	male	Murad is 6-year-old boy from Damascus, Syria, who had to fight adversity from the first day of his life. Born with syndactyly, a disability where the fingers are fused together, Murad was bullied all the time. Everyone was laughing at him Sinam, his mother, says so Id hide his hands in long sleeves to protect him. Two surgeries later Murad was getting better however, that was when the war broke in Syria. We moved to a camp in Iraq and Murad grew to be a very mischievous boy. It was really difficult for me, Murad was very lively and naughty. Parents of other children were constantly complaining about him. The family then moved to Turkey and soon, Murads father and brother left for Germany, leaving the rest of the family behind. Sinam, Murad and his brothers tried to cross the land border between Greece and Turkey 4 times to no avail. Finally, a smuggler cramped them into a lorry and transported them to the other side of the border. So many people were crowed in there! I was very scared that my sons would get crushed. I was holding Murad into my arms so tight, he screamed, Mummy, my legs are breaking and I hugged him even more tightly. However, their adventure was far from over, as the family ended up at the makeshift camp of Idomeni, northern Greece. It was already late, as the European borders had already closed. We were waiting for the border to re-open. Every day, for more than 4 months, we were hoping and every night we were saying to each other no worries, it will open tomorrow. When they moved us to the Derveni Alexyl camp we had no money, no clothes, we had lost hope… but soon we felt better, because there we had food, toilet, showers and shelter. Eventually, I thought, God saved us, lets stay here and something good could happen to us. Since January 2017, Murad and his family, along with 223 people, live Dimitra Hotel, in Mouries, Kilkis, while the accommodation centre is undergoing construction work to upgrade the standards of living. Sinam says: Murad now is happier and calmer than ever before. For the first time in his life hes staying in a proper house, he didnt know what its like to live in a house, as until now he has lived only in tents. The first days everything was a surprise for him. He opened and closed the doors, went up and down the stairs, everything seemed so strange to him. The first week he kept on falling off his bed, because he was not used to it. I didnt sleep as well as I had to keep an eye on him. For the time being, Murad can be a normal child and keep on playing in and around the hotel with his brothers. As for Sinam, shes anxiously waiting for the time that her family will be reunited again in Germany and start a new life, all together again.

Living in northern Aleppo, he regularly travels between Turkey and Syria under the constant threat of aerial bombings. His home has already been hit by bombs before and despite it being damaged, Murat and his family refuse to leave. That place has always been our home and we wont ever leave it, admits Murat. These bombings have become so regular over the years that my children have become accustomed to it. He continues his job driving along the perilous routes out of a need to provide for his family as well as a belief that what he is doing is serving a truly important purpose. Am I afraid? Of course I am, every time I get behind that wheel but there are hundreds of people who need the supplies that I am carrying and somebody has to do it.

He always believes in me. I am thankful.
683	Musa Fofana	Gambia	Libya	A	A	close	757	4243	H	im	male	Thanks to this project, I have earned the respect of the community. Now I can do things I would not have been able to do. Before I left for Europe in 2018, I had no job and my family was struggling to make ends meet. I dreamt of earning enough income to support my family through the backway, but it was a tough journey. After a year in Libya, I made numerous attempts to cross the Mediterranean, but there was no way to go through the sea. In 2019, I decided to return to The Gambia. When I returned to my hometown of Kundam, Upper River Region, my mother was so excited I was alive. For other community members and friends, though, I failed. Some mocked me because I didnt reach Europe. However, I always avoided allowing these opinions to shape my future, so I started doing menial jobs to support my family. Upon return, I attended a business and entrepreneurial training with two other returnees and five community members. We decided to partner to set-up a community reintegration project, then secured a set of three multi-purpose milling machines and a trimming machine. The income we generated has been very impactful for me, my family and the community. Moreover, the milling machines have improved food security in our community. Thanks to this project, I have earned the respect of the community. As a returnee settling back in, this is really important to me. Now, I can do things I would not have been able to do. Due to COVID-19, however, our business has been affected. People are not coming as usual or they do not have money to pay for the milling. This is unfortunate, as we have to buy fuel for the machines and face production costs. To safeguard our business, we mill for some of our customers on credit and we allow payments in coos, maize or millet to sell them in Basse when better times come. This way, we can continue making a living.
684	Musa Jallow	Gambia	Libya	A	A	close	757	4243	H	im	male	My family is happy that I go to work every day, and hopefully at the end of the month I will be able to bring home enough income for all. In 2017, I lost my job at a transport company and I could no longer support my family financially. For this reason, I decided to embark on the backway. After a year working in Tripoli, I lost my job because of the conflict. I was not certain of securing another job, so I returned to The Gambia in November 2019. My return brought so much joy to my family. At the same time, a few people in the community laughed at me when I returned, saying I was useless. However, the most important thing for me is family, so I didnt care about what other people said. What really mattered was to make sure that my family and kids had a better future. Immediately after returning, I would fetch firewood and do other menial jobs to sustain myself. In June 2020, I received support to operate a commercial taxi, a project in cooperation with my community. I just started the business a month ago and it has been going well so far. My family is happy that I go to work every day, and hopefully at the end of the month I will be able to bring home enough income for all, besides the money for the community and car maintenance. Because were going to be living with the virus for some time, I have to adapt my business. Though I have to think about being safe when working. I will not sit and fold my hands because of the pandemic. I will continue to work within shorter destinations. This way, the car will consume less fuel, and this will be more profitable for me.
685	Mussie	Eritrea	Switzerland	A	E	far	588	86919	H	im	male	I left Eritrea to live in freedom and without fear. I was born and raised during war. At that time you could always be suspected by anyone, for anything you said. We were fighting our own brothers and it was difficult to accept. We were constantly living in fear. Even to go from one place to another, I needed an authorization. I felt the deep need to live free of all these rules. In 1992, relatives advised me to leave, telling me that it would get harder afterwards. I first thought of Italy, because of the historical links between the two countries but also because my father was there. Since I was a child, I would read Mickey Mouse or Famiglia Cristiana (Christian family) in Italian. My parents also had studied Italian. My journey and arrival in Rome is what today would be considered as a luxurious journey - I had a visa and I arrived by plane. I will always remember my first night in the capital city. I had been sheltered by monks and when I woke up in the morning, I heard so much noise I thought there was an invasion of bees in the streets. I asked a monk about the noise. He took me to the terrace of the building and I saw a crowd and a beautiful place. The monk told me: You are in front of the most beautiful fountain in the world, the Trevi Fountain. That is my first memory of Rome. After 3 months, I started to work at the markets, selling fruits and vegetables. Thats how I learnt Italian and the Roman dialect. I got to meet a lot of people and discover a new world. Religion was always on my mind. I was attracted to religion since I was 14, but my father told me to wait until I turned 18. In 2010, after years of learning, I was ordained in the Roman Catholic Church. I already had seen my compatriots living under terrible conditions in Italy, sleeping in the streets and penniless. I also was in touch with Eritreans in Libya and I told myself that I cant just translate what they are saying to a journalist. I have to denounce whats going on. However, people I would meet and talk to about my compatriots would ask: But who are you? Who do you represent?  Thats when I decided to be even more devoted and launch information campaigns. I founded the association Habeshia in order to help and assist my people.   It was widely reported that Mussie Zerai was a candidate for the 2015 Nobel Prize for Peace. In Switzerland where he resides now, he was appointed by the Swiss Church to assist Catholic Eritrean or Ethiopians in the country. He continues his fight to give Eritreans - more than 36,000 of them have reached Italian coasts so far this year – a voice. And what a voice.

Originally from Afghanistan, the two brothers made the difficult journey to Europe together with their family. Their father, Abdul, is happy and proud to see his children get on the school bus every day, as education is the most important thing he would like to offer them. The boys are really excited to attend school and were very pleased with their school kits, which they happily showed to everyone around, before hopping on the bus together with their friends, accompanied by IOM escorts who are always on the pupils side.
688	Mustapha	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	male	In a small two bedroom apartment in one of the known refugee neighbourhoods of Salinufra lives Mustapha, Shama and their three daughters. Living in Turkey since June 2015, they are among the millions of Syrian refugees in Turkey. Before fleeing Syria, they were living in their hometown of Homs during the war under the constant threat of being bombed. It was two years ago when it happened. We were in our house when one of the planes circling our neighbourhood dropped bombs on us again. One of them hit close to our home and the explosion ripped through our house, says Mustapha. One of the shrapnel came through and punctured our hot water tank spilling boiling water on my daughter Saca. She suffered from third degree burns on her back and legs. Searching for medical treatment in Homs was a challenge but the family managed to get Saca initial treatment for her burns but she required several follow up treatments. When she was on the road to recovery she got an infection on her back due to poorly sterilized medical tools. It got so bad that she would cry from her being so sensitive to heat and ash from the constant bombing. Eventually, Mustapha managed to send her and Shama to Lebanon to seek further treatment. Over the course of six months Shama searched endlessly for doctors while Mustapha continued to provide money and support from inside Syria. She searched everywhere but the treatment over there was going to cost USD 13,000 and we simply dont have that kind of money so they had to come back, he says. With no more options, the family decided to move to Turkey where Mustapha travelled nearly 100km on foot into Turkey to try and make all of the arrangements for his familys safe travels into Turkey. While in Salinufra, Mustapha worked at a restaurant to make ends meet while Shama continued to look for treatment for Saca. One day, the familys case was referred to IOM and following their first assessment Mustapha initially had little hope for receiving any assistance for her daughters condition. Their hopes were renewed, however, after receiving a specialized silicon pressure garment for Saca just a few days after their visit. I was completely shocked. After searching high and low for help with so many failed attempts reaching out to others for help, I thought this would be no different. The garment costs around USD 2,700 and works by applying continuous pressure to help prevent the thickening and hardening of scars. After sometime Mustapha requested a resized garment to fit Saca as she grows and was relieved to have received a newly fitted one days later. Shes completely changed, you can see it in her face now, he says. Even though shes is recovering from her injuries she still suffers from flashbacks and nightmares from the event. She has a long way to go but I am just glad that she is getting there, our prayers have been answered.
689	Mykhaylo	Ukraine	Austria	E	E	close	3557	48106	H	im	male	I was born and raised in Ukraine. At the age of 15, I came to Austria as an exchange student. At that time, I spent half a year living with an Indian family in Vienna, who had immigrated to Austria almost 30 years earlier. Whilst living with them, I took a liking to the enjoyable flavors of the Viennese Schnitzel and spicy Indian cuisine. My Indian friends often encouraged me to learn German and to be open-minded. I really enjoyed discovering Austria and getting to know its Indian community. It was an experience that has helped me a lot in life, particularly when dealing with people of different cultural backgrounds. Another thing that I learned from my Austrian friends of Indian origin was to view integration as an opportunity and how enriching it is to preserve ones own cultural tradition whilst simultaneously being a good and loyal citizen of the country one chooses to reside in. When my exchange programme in Austria came to an end, I moved back to Ukraine, resolving to be a global citizen who is prepared to go anywhere in the world. Consequently, I decided to study history and international relations abroad and moved back to Austria for this purpose and completed a part of my studies in Canada. Currently, I am working on AVRR in Vienna. Dealing with people who wish to voluntarily return to their countries of origin has allowed me experience a new aspect of migration. Thinking about the generation of my parents, who grew up behind the iron curtain in the Soviet Union, I feel very fortunate for being able to see different parts of the world. That would not have been possible for my parents during their student life. All in all, my migration experience has taught me the relevance of the timeless advice offered by Taras Shevchenko, a Ukrainian poet of the 19th century: Learn from others and do not shun your own.

My first stop was on the island of Chios, and then I came to Athens by boat. I stayed in an Athens hotel for one year before moving to OCAVRR, the open accommodation center for people registered for voluntary returns. All personnel have been very helpful and kind. I have my own room and the food is delicious. I decided to leave my country for personal and political reasons. I was not feeling safe. Now, things are different. The political situation in my country has changed and stabilized. There is no war and I can tell you from the bottom of my heart that I love my country. I was aware of IOM from the internet and I applied for voluntary return assistance (AVRR). Before I left my home, I worked as an assistant manager in a restaurant in Beirut for 10 years. I love cooking and everything related to food, even though I am not a chef. Lebanon is famous for its local food and my dream is to open my small personal food business; but not a fancy restaurant and definitely not something expensive. I want to open a fast food restaurant or a drive-through for local cuisine. Food is an inextricable part of our culture and I really believe I can be very creative in the culinary field. My favorite food is called warak arich; grape leaves stuffed with meat. Food means more than pleasure to me. It is something that brings people together and I think this is the reason why I love working in the food industry; this is the reason why I want to go back to my country and restart my life. The Open Centre for migrants registered for assisted voluntary return and reintegration (OCAVRR) is co funded by the European Return Fund and the Hellenic Ministry for Migration Policy."
691	Nadifo	Somalia	Canada	A	N	far	118	43560	H	im	female	I think Canada is a good country, where multiculturalism is practiced, where so many people are there together in peace. Nadifo is a 20-year-old Somali refugee who has spent her whole life in Kenya. She was born in 1995 in a refugee camp near Mombasa, Kenya. Her parents fled from Somalia in 1992 at the height of the civil war. She has never been to Somalia and never left Kenya. When she was a year old, in 1996, she and her family were transferred to Hagadera refugee camp, one of the many sections of Dadaab Refugee Camp in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Despite the difficult circumstances of her upbringing, Nadifo exceled at school, completing both primary and secondary education with very strong results. Due to this she has been awarded a refugee scholarship to study in Canada, and is in the process of leaving Kenya for Vancouver where she will enroll in university. She hopes to pursue medicine and wants to become a doctor. It has not been easy to get where she is. Nadifo says there are challenges of the environment and security, as well as resources while growing up in a refugee camp. Being a refugee is not something that is simple. The environment is so harsh there. But I have just been patient and tolerant so one day I can go out of the camp and help my parents and siblings. Nadifo received assistance from humanitarian agencies in Dadaab, but she said it was not enough. It was a daily struggle to get pens, books, and solar lamps so she could study. Nadifos perseverance with her education is paying off. She has the opportunity to continue her studies and better her life and that of her family. For now she intends to reside in Canada permanently, but she will definitely come back to visit her family. I think Canada is a good country, where multiculturalism is practiced, where so many people are there together in peace. I want to pursue my education so I can have a bright future.

Since my Iraq was not stable, my family and I decided to go to Lebanon first. While there, I chose to go Sweden because my friends and siblings were already living there; the rest of my family decided to go to the United States I crossed so many countries before reaching Sweden. I paid a lot of money, faced many hardships, saw many people suffering, hungry and homeless. Still, I wanted to go to Sweden and live the perfect life I had imagined. Once I arrived, I faced something quite different than expected. I experienced culture shock. I also saw how Swedish people enjoyed their lives. Adapting to their rules and policies was a challenge for me, but overall I liked their lifestyle and tried to live a normal life like them. I missed Iraq's warm weather, my family and my friends. Nevertheless, I tried my best to learn Swedish to enter a local university. I was also working and waiting for one thing: an official document that would allow me to stay there. But it didnt happen. My father got very sick while he was visiting me and he decided to go back to his hometown. This pushed me to go back to my country, with my parents. My migration experience led me to apply for a job at IOM Iraq to help displaced persons and migrants in my country. During my time in Sweden, I learned about cultural diversity and traditions. I also managed to learn Swedish, English and some Greek, which helped me to easily get a job in my country. Thanks to the hardships I faced, I learned that even if you have everything and are enjoying your life abroad, you will always feel like a stranger. Something will always be missing — home. I consider Sweden to be my second home but as the Swedish proverb says: being away is good but home is the best."
693	Nana	Ghana	South Africa	A	A	close	2206	5094	E	im	female	Growing up in Ghana I always knew that I wanted to be a teacher. Teaching always came as second nature to me. In 1992 after I got married, my husband convinced me to relocate to South Africa to come stay with him and start a new life with our children. At first, I was very hesitant to leave everything I know behind. I was worried about having to adapt to a new culture and new environment. But somehow I knew it will be an opportunity for me to continue with my teaching and further my studies. Arriving in South Africa with my Diploma in teaching my first job was in the Eastern Cape where my family and I stayed.  The first few months were the hardest. I missed home and everything about Ghana. As the years went by I managed to settle down and got used to the new environment. The humbleness and friendliness of the people were what kept me going. After seven years we were forced to move to another province to find more opportunities. Being a migrant means that you cannot hold a permanent employment position. With that, I found myself moving from one school to the other. With all the ups and downs of looking for work, I finally decided to open my own business. I opened a salon as a way to make a living. It sustained me for some time but my burning desire to change lives through education was always alive and kicking. The privilege of being in South Africa gave me an opportunity to further my studies in what I love. I completed my Masters Degree and went on further to acquiring a Ph.D. in Environmental Management. I continue working as a research lecturer at the University of South Africa and my dream to change lives through education is still continuing and I am honored to be doing that in this country. South Africa today is no longer the same as the South Africa I arrived into 22 years ago. I believe people back then took us in as migrants and they understood that being a migrant does not make you any different. We are all humans from different countries combined in one world. The generation of today still needs to be educated and informed about the importance of social cohesion which is one of my priorities in my line of work. It saddens me that to this day we are still experiencing xenophobia, police harassment and people looking down on us as migrants. Although I love South Africa and I have adapted very much into the culture, I still dream to go back home in the next years. I feel that this will enable me to pour back my skills, knowledge, and experience to my community that I received in South Africa.
694	Naoko	Japan	Germany	I	E	far	39990	45909	E	im	female	I came to Germany in 1996, when I was 20 years old to study music and then I stayed. After my studies I got work here as a musician and nowadays I work as a pianist, piano teacher and choirmaster in Berlin. I had no initial difficulties in Germany. People in Berlin were quite nice and I was doing well from the beginning. I learned German at the Goethe-Institut and people there were helping me a lot. I think Germans are quite open minded, friendly and honest people. I teach piano and brought all my musical skills to Germany that I am now making to use here. I rarely miss Japan, but sometimes I miss big department stores and all those little convenient stores that we have – they are like small take-away places and open for 24 hours. I am a musician and I would like to hear classical Japanese music more often and also get to see more classical Japanese plays. But I am happy in Germany: I am a musician and this is a good place for me to work with music. I rarely encounter misunderstandings with Germans. People here are very honest and I think that is great. Japanese people are sometimes not very clear and hold back with their opinions. Here in Germany people are very clear and outspoken about what they think. I like that and I still notice the difference between the two countries. Still today, I cannot differentiate between R and L, so Germans tend to laugh at that. They smile at my pronunciation. Naoko does not seem to be miffed about this reaction of the people in her chosen country. She is planning to stay in Berlin, even though Kobe, her hometown will always mean home to her: My hometown is a harbour city, so to me home means sea and mountains.
695	Naser Family	Syrian Arab Republic	Ireland	M	E	far	890	86251	H	im	n	The Naser family were eating breakfast the first time they felt the ground shake from a nearby explosion. They had watched in fear as the violence spread through Syria after protests escalated in March 2011. In the capital city they felt relatively safe and disconnected from the conflict. Dima had heard rumours of violent protests on the outskirts of Aleppo and Damascus. You heard about it but you didnt see it. We thought, were okay, it wont come to Damascus. Then the explosions started in November 2011. Dima remembers the windowpanes shaking after the first bomb fell near their home. The second explosion shattered the glass. Dimas husband, Modar, rushed his wife and two children, Kamar and Naser, into the bathroom, where they waited for the bombing to cease. As they crouched together in fear, Kamar turned to her father and pleaded, Can we leave this country? The following week the family left for Ireland. I told them to arrange their things, we were only going for one week, says Modar, who worked as an orthodontic dentist in Damascus. We checked in small bags, just the basics. Modar recognises how fortunate they were to leave Syria while it was still in a relatively good condition. His children will carry with them the image of the beautiful country it once was. Before 2011 the family were enjoying the golden years, says Modar. My job was very good and I worked very hard. We travelled a lot and I had patients from lots of countries.
696	Nasima	Afghanistan	Finland	I	E	far	508	48685	H	im	female	"In 1992 my family's life completely changed. After the regime change in Afghanistan, a new bloody war broke out and we escaped to Finland. At the time, I was eight years old. Beginning our life in Finland was not easy. We didnt know the language and my parents couldnt find jobs. But my brother and I loved our school. My father had taken us to Finland, because he thought that it was safe and would offer his children the best possible education and future. Our parents supported us and I did well in school. After graduating from high school, I worked for different NGOs. My work with immigrant women was rewarded in 2010 and I was nominated as a Refugee Woman of the Year. A year after that I decided to run for parliament. I was very close to being elected, but the time wasn't right yet. Four years later, my dream came true; after the elections in 2015, I became a member of the parliament. I was the first MP in Finlands parliament with a refugee background. It was a big day for me, but also for my whole family. Twenty-three years after arriving in this cold and strange country, Finnish people had elected me to represent them in the parliament. That was more than any of us could have ever dreamt of. In the spring of 2017, I got an opportunity to become a deputy mayor of Helsinki, in charge of the Culture and Leisure Division. It wasnt an easy decision to leave the parliament, but now Im happy that I took the new role. Helsinki is a fast-growing capital city — big cities change the world, and I feel that Helsinki is no exception. As Finnish as I have become over the years, I still have an immigrant and refugee background. Therefore, I feel that I have a big responsibility to be an example to the thousands of young immigrants in Helsinki. When I speak to them and meet them, my message is: 'Believe in yourself, everything is possible.' If someone had told 15-year-old Nasima, that one day she would be a member of the parliament and a deputy mayor of Helsinki, she would not have believed it. Hard work and the support from family and friends have brought me here. I am thankful for everything Finland has offered me and I hope my work is the way to pay back."
697	Natalia	Moldova	Hungary	E	E	close	2954	16129	H	im	female	"The education system in Moldova is far from ideal. Teachers are not always progressive, and students dont seem to care about studies. So many people choose to study abroad. At least half of my high school classmates left the country. I was planning to stay regardless of this situation but my parents decided that I should go to university in Hungary. It was comforting for them that Hungary is relatively close to Moldova but it is in Europe and it was one of the less expensive options. I didnt want to go. I was being stubborn but they convinced me that this was the right thing to do. My first impression was that everything is big, look unfamiliar and so different, and that I would never be able to fit in. How will I be able to find my way around? I was 19, I had never lived alone and I was by myself. But I knew that it was good and something I had to do, and this pushed me. I was 100% sure that I would move home after university. But as soon as you move abroad you perceive that the world is not locked in one city, that there are opportunities. When you go to Europe you see that people are more open-minded, there are more chilled perspectives on life. You meet different people with different backgrounds and you realize that you can go anywhere if you want. After I graduated I was made a job offer and by that time Budapest already became my home. I met my best friend on the first day I moved here. Now shes my family here. I was lucky, I dont think everyone has the luxury to find someone they can connect with so easily. I like the people I work with as well. I think thats a kind of work family. Budapest is magically beautiful. It changed a lot since I came here. It became more open minded and people speak English much more than they used to. You always have places to go to and new things to discover. Sometimes I feel like getting away from adult life, going back to my childhood home. But its sad to go back to a place where you grew up, a lot of your childhood memories are linked and where your family is living; and see that the situation is very bad. You always want your loved ones to be comfortable and not just survive. I like living here much more and I would like my family to be able to do the same but its not possible. Now its really hard to live in Moldova. You just get by but planning your retirement or vacation can be a challenge. Theres no war or natural disaster but its still a poor country with a bad economic situation and I would like them to live better than they do now. If I had to describe the past 8 years I would say. unexpectedly long, surprising, grateful,challenging, I'm living in my favorite city in the world, I'm happy, and I found myself."
698	Natalia	Poland	Estonia	E	E	close	15764	23106	E	im	female	I first came to Estonia as an exchange student. I was supposed to stay here for five months but obviously, things changed. The decision to stay here was very intuitive, it wasnt rational. I just felt very comfortable here and thought if i stayed here longer, good things would happen. Then, of course, I met an Estonian guy, and now Ive been living here for two and a half years. When I first came to Estonia, I had no excpectations. If we think about migration nowadays, people mostly go to Scandinavia or Germany, the United Kingdom, France. I could imagine life in those countries but I had never been to this region at all. Having no previous knowledge or expectations made it so much more interesting to come to another Eastern European country. What I like about Estonia the most is the way people treat each other. I think its because its such a small country: people take friendships more seriously. Its harder to get close to people but once you do, the friendship is forever. Another thing I like is the people's secular attitude. In Poland, I always felt the need to protest, especially when it came to womens rights. Poland is very traditional and conservative: many things there shouldnt be like this in the 21st century. In Estonia, I feel more comfortable as a woman. Right now, my life and my heart is in Estonia. I will definitely stay here for a while. In many respects, I feel closer to Tallinn and the Estonian culture. But of course I also miss Poland: I miss the very open, emotional style of communication and I miss Polish culture, going to the theatre, cinema and local exhibitions. I think to feel integrated, one should know the local language. Im a bit ashamed I still dont speak it. Since everybody speaks very good English here, you can get by with that, but you cant read the local news and feel part of the community. Here, by organizing some cultural events, I have gotten close to the locals, but I wish I could also read the news or Sirp to see what my friends are writing. I think participating in cultural activities is really what integrates you into the society. In the last year, Ive really noticed how multicultural Tallinn is getting. In the centre of the city, you mainly hear English! I dont know if its a good or a bad thing but I think Estonians have nothing to worry about: their sense of national identity and culture is so strong it cant be endangered by migration. And since so many people are leaving the country, you need immigrants to keep the economy going. Also, more migration brings more good food and enriches the local cuisine! I really feel at home in Tallinn. Geographically and demographically, its perfect here. Honestly, it feels so cool here - I live in Eastern Europe but I feel so cosmopolitan! And Ive been welcomed so warmly by Estonian, I was helped a lot by Estonians. Im thinking I probably wont be able to repay all this kindness but I would like to give the society something back in the future.
699	Nataliya	Ukraine	Portugal	E	E	close	3557	22413	H	im	female	I'm from Ukraine, but Ive lived in Portugal for 14 years and I am now a Portuguese citizen too! There are several stages in a human life - mine were rather conventional until I turned 30 years old, and I had all that I had dreamed of. I was married, I was the mother of an eight-year-old boy, and I was at the top of my professional career working as a primary school teacher and a scientific board director in a Ukrainian high-school. However, one day my husband became unemployed and he migrated to Portugal to look for new opportunities. Two years later, I made the decision to join him, putting aside my home, my job, my family and friends. I didnt know what to expect and I didnt speak Portuguese – but I knew for sure that I was on my way to meet my husband, and that we could follow our dreams together. I started by working as a babysitter as well as an employee in a local pastry shop, but I also studied Portuguese intensively. I wanted to learn in order to find different a job. At the same time, I became the Regional Director for the Association for Eastern Migrants, acting as the spokesperson in defense of the rights of many migrants living in Portugal. When my husband and I stabilized our situation in Portugal, I decided to go back to university. Then, our son joined us when he turned 14 years old. He is now a doctor, having graduated from Coimbra University. I finished a Masters degree in Public Administration and I just started a PhD in Legal Sociology in the same University. With the knowledge I have acquired, I presented a pilot project for welcoming refugees to the Miranda do Corvo Foundation. The project was approved and today I am responsible for several refugee families. The projects reception was very positive, leading me to create my own organisation in migration and refugee integration in Portugal called Peaceful Parallel. My aim is to welcome more refugees with special needs, as well as orphaned children. This work represents one more dream I have managed to achieve. My work for this organisation is still volunteer work, so in addition to this activity I also worked as a sub-director for a hotel before giving it up to dedicate myself exclusively to my organisation. People continue to show solidarity and this gives me the strength to continue helping others get a second chance, as I once did. I work with passion and I feel happy every time I see a smile on the face of someone who benefits from the association, or when I observe them learning Portuguese. I have achieved new dreams in Portugal, I have my family, friends, the Peaceful Parallel organisation, and I love my work. Muito Obrigada!
700	Natalya	Ukraine	Germany	E	E	close	3557	45909	H	im	female	"I came to Germany as a child as a so-called quota refugee. We were of Jewish descent and from the former Soviet Union – hence we could come to Germany in 2001. The journey took 36 hours by bus. I had never travelled before, and it was altogether very exhausting. Our first stop was Dresden, where I saw a shopping mall for the first time in my life. It was also the first time in my life, when I wasnt able to communicate. That was a shock! At the beginning things were very difficult. For several months my mother, my father and myself had to share a room; but after the first week I already went to school. I had always been good at school, so I wanted to be good in my German school as well. Therefore it was clear to me that I had to learn German well and very fast. From that point on I was pretty much on my own, my parents never learned German, and from an early age, I made my own decisions. As any teenager, of course, I had problems during puberty. For me these problems were reinforced by identity struggles. I was always torn between the school and my life there, and the parallel world, in which I grew up. I was forced early on to be self-reliant and even though I never took the leaving certificate, I had a Masters degree under my belt when I was 22. From my own story I have learned something: In Germany there are too many obstacles in the way, for people to climb the social ladder – regardless whether they have a migration background or not. Thats why Ive established an independent initiative called Netzwerk Chancen. We want to be a platform for dialogue to enhance the equality of opportunities in Germany. I am absolutely certain that exchange can help to fight prejudices. Therefore I am engaging in dialogue between the different social classes, but also between different cultures. I am glad if I can further the Germans understanding of the people in the Ukraine and Russia. Interestingly, from working with Russians I also know that my mentality is absolutely German. I am German. To me that is self-evident and normal. Germany is a very diverse country."
701	Natasha	Japan	United States	I	N	far	39990	63123	E	im	female	My story begins with my grandparents journey from Colombia to Chicago in 1966. My grandfather had a well-paying job in Colombia, but decided to leave his comfortable life there to give his children more opportunities in the United States. My family stayed in the United States for a decade before returning to Colombia, where the climate was more forgiving and a broad network of family and friends awaited them. My father and his brother, however, were able to walk away with birthright American citizenship— something that would come to change the course of my fathers entire life. He returned to America when he was 19, joining the United States Navy after barely passing the English aptitude test. He was eventually stationed in Yokosuka, Japan, where he met a local lady who would come to be my mother. I was born in Yokosuka and lived in Japan until I was six. When my father finished his term in the Navy, the three of us moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, so that he could start a career with the degree hed earned while in service. We were alone in America, with no Japanese family and few Colombian relatives in the country. The pressures for my family to assimilate were strong in our first years there. My Japanese self and its development felt thwarted in childhood, when I was ripped away from the culture that I had considered the core of my identity. A great uneasiness haunted me at the thought of becoming an American, of becoming part of a culture that closed me off when I first entered it. I had accepted my place as an outsider in America, but realizing that I was an outsider in Japan was too much to bear. It was, for lack of a better word, heartbreaking. I developed an intimacy with Japanese during my youth that I could not let go of. So after my most recent trip to Japan, I decided to give one last push against the forces of my fated Americanization by taking advanced Japanese classes at the University. But this, in turn, brought up another dilemma—of whether or not to continue learning Spanish, the language of my fathers family. I feared the risk of pushing one language out of my brain by learning another. It felt as though I was being forced to choose between the two sides of my family. Languages became worlds in themselves, bridges to cultures, identities. Thus, I have come to realize that my identity, as my relationship with language, is fluid.
702	Natasha	Serbia	Portugal	E	E	close	7656	22413	E	im	female	I am from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I was born in Bosnia, lived in Serbia and married a Croatian man. I have lived in Portugal for 18 years now. While growing up, my parents were frustrated to know that I was so passionate about theatre. I therefore ended up reluctantly studying Law for one year at the University in Belgrade in Serbia. Two years before starting University, I had fallen in love with a Croatian scout who was living in Sarajevo. We had been in a long-distance relationship for three years – him in Sarajevo and me in Belgrade – and we got married when I turned 20. I moved in with him in Sarajevo and gave birth to our twin girls. I also quickly changed my University degree, from Law to Theatre in 1990. Unfortunately, the war broke out in 1992 and my dream fell apart. We were in danger irrespective of any of the troops that would enter the city because I was Serbian and he was Croatian. We were able to flee Belgrade to where my parents were living. Eight of us lived in a two-bedroom flat. I continued studying theatre at University and as time went by I began to develop childrens theatre projects and specialized in child theatre. Even though I was very successful, the life conditions around me were hard. Men were mobilized to go to war, essential goods in supermarkets were sold out and we were constantly living in a climate of fear. NATO then intervened in the country in 1999 and we decided to leave. My brother had previously studied in Portugal as part of the Erasmus European program and had lived in Lisbon at that time, so he invited us to stay with him. We arrived in Portugal on the 25th May 1999. My eight-year-old daughters integrated and learned the language very quickly, hence becoming my translators. It took longer for me to adapt and to be able to work again in theatre. I did not know a word of Portuguese and I thought I would never be able to perform again. I began by looking for places where I could work in English and I found the Irish pub in the Cais do Sodré area. At that time, my husband was working during the day in a transportation company. It looked as if everything was fine, but we were already 'miles' away from each other. We got divorced a year later and he returned to Bosnia. I stayed alone with my two daughters in Portugal. I knew that I could not work as an actress because I did not speak Portuguese, but I could translate my plays with some help. I ended up translating my first play and preparing all the Portuguese actors for the show. At the last minute, one of the actresses was not able to perform and the theatre company convinced me to learn the lines in Portuguese by heart. This is how I began acting again. It was so motivating, to realize that people were receptive of my work, that I ended up taking advantage of my accent and the fact that I stand out. From then on, I have not stopped. At that time I started childrens theatre and I began teaching theatre classes. I am a member of the Palco de Chocolate association, in which I teach theatre to children and young people. Meanwhile, I also continue to perform and produce plays with my theatre company and I do performances that tackle several social issues. In 2006 I presented the story of my life in a play called Eastern Wind (Vento Leste) which became a national and international success. It was an opportunity to process the pain caused by the war and a chance to raise peoples awareness about the sad reality of war. Both my daughters have finished their college degrees in Lisbon and are living apart from each other. One stayed in Lisbon and the other moved to Belgrade, reflecting the way I feel – divided between both countries. Nowadays I feel that I belong a bit there and here. Are these consequences of war? War is like this, it expels people from their homes and forces them to pack their whole life in a suitcase. I came to understand that it can fit, but it is necessary to start packing well before any war starts. My parents prepared me so well that my suitcase was already packed by the time the war broke out. Life is a challenge, so do not forget to prepare your suitcase, because you never know when you will need it. We need to be aware of our capacities, tolerate differences and always be ready to learn and adapt.
703	Nathalie	France	Belgium	E	E	close	38959	45028	E	im	female	I have always been interested in discussing the issue of migration, because I consider myself a migrant: I currently work between Brussels, Strasbourg and Paris. One word that suits me is nomad and there are many things I have in common with nomadic populations, especially because I find it easy to adapt to new environments. Being a nomad means living on the move, which makes life incredibly rich and much more interesting for me than a stationary existence. Obviously, many difficulties can arise from being in a country that is not yours. One of them is to be able to blossom and reach ones full potential in the place where one has migrated. My parents experienced deportation, but they managed to find strength despite the upheaval. As we mark the 60th anniversary of the Rome Treaty, its important in Europe that we remember the importance of humanity and that we keep it in mind every time we make decisions. Racism stems from fear of the other, but it is high time to take stereotypes and wring their necks.

I had a backpack with my belongings with me, but the human traffickers told me to throw it away. The only thing I have left is this little book from the police academy and a necklace my mother gave me. I always dreamed of becoming a police officer.

Its very nice in Greece, but we plan to leave with family reunification, we are waiting for our papers with great impatience. We fled Afghanistan and went to Iran, to Turkey and then we reached Lesvos. We stayed for eight months on the island and then we came to Kavala. Life is much better here, we have our own space, my kids get to go to school. My daughters, 16-year-old Zahra and 17-year-old Zainab go to the Greek high school. Zahra wants to become a dentist and Zainab is not sure yet, but she likes economics a lot. I would like them to study whatever they want but they need to learn how to use computers, it is very important for their future. Our everyday life in Kavala, and our relationship with the Greeks is very good. We go to the city, buy what we need, see the Greeks and talk with them. They are very good people, they like foreigners.

Through Iraq and Turkey we reached the Greek borders and we are now staying at the accommodation center for migrants and refugees in Kavala, a city in northern Greece. Even though I studied banking and finance, I have worked for NGOs in refugee camps in Iraq and Syria. Organizing activities for children was my favorite part. Refugee children have been continuously exposed to traumatic events and need special support because of their vulnerability. I find child protection great as it helps kids overcome their problems. My life now is nicer, more quiet. Im going to English and Greek classes in order to better my language skills. And I play at the football team we have put together! Weve even played a few games with the locals. It was a good opportunity to meet with Greek people. Its amazing that both communities mix and learn from each other and activities help a lot towards this direction.
707	Nestor	Cote d'Ivoire	Benin	A	A	close	2318	1254	E	im	male	I am from Benin Republic, but I was born in Ivory Coast. In 1980, my parents immigrated to Ivory Coast for their business where I lived from my birth to 2009. In 2009, when I earned my baccalaureate degree, Ivory Coast was facing political crisis. To save my education, my parents decided that I would go to Benin for university. When I arrived in Benin, although it is my home country, I was homesick and felt alone, I often remembered my parents. One day, a classmate asked me:  Nestor, are you Ivorian or Beninese? I was confused and before I could answer, another friend replied Nestor came from Ivory Coast, because of the war. That very day, I realized that I am a refugee in my own country, whereas in Ivory Coast I considered myself a migrant. Currently I live in Benin, but when I am on holiday I regularly go back to Ivory Coast to visit my parents and my Ivorian friends. Furthermore, I have some exciting experiences in Benin. Since I came here I got very involved in helping create a better world. I have received numerous awards for my leadership and commitment. In 2016, I have been selected as one of the 16 Young Leaders of the world by the European Commission. In that regard, I attended the European Development Days in Brussels in this same year I received the award of Ten Outstanding Young Person in Benin (TOYP). I think that these awards honor my country Benin and make my Ivorian friends proud as well. but one question comes to my mind: If my education wasnt saved, couldve I made all these achievements? As for me, to achieve my dream in helping create the best world possible, I would like to travel around the world to learn more about other cultures. Tomorrow is another day. Maybe, in the future, I will leave Benin for another country. I believe that we are all from everywhere, but also from nowhere.

I first came on holiday in 2000 and did not want to go back to Mozambique. My parents ended up accepting my choice, so I stayed here with my grandparents. I lived without a residence permit for 11 years because there was no agreement regarding my custody and I only became documented in 2011. Despite that I always lived a normal life, but I could not travel so I spent 13 years without seeing my parents. Being undocumented also limited my life compared to my friends. I always felt that this conditioned my childhood — I always wanted to travel but could not. Nowadays, I feel divided because I have been in Portugal for a long time but I would like to work in Mozambique one day. I have had many opportunities here and maybe this is why I would like to create opportunities for others in Mozambique. I dream of being a diplomat or an education minister. I still have not finished my Bachelors degree in social work yet, but I am already thinking about my Masters. It is not easy to choose. Today I recognize how lucky I am to be living in Lisbon, because it is hard to have difficult days here. Every day is beautiful in the city of light. Yet, my childhood was difficult. When I arrived in Portugal I had an accent and the other children would laugh at me. Many of my friends came from the ghetto and thought I must have come from there too because I was African. They would automatically label me, but because I would not go along with what they did, they used to say that I was posh or white. It was difficult for me to forge my identity because I did not fit into society's boxes. Nowadays there are more outlets for me to express myself and I feel that people do not need to categorize others as much. I took jazz classes growing and I fell in love with music and singing. Since then I have been singing jazz and soul in bars. I love soul music, but the audience for it is still small in Portugal. I like to try different things, so at the moment I am working on a musical. Besides music, I enjoy volunteering and travelling. Although people find it weird that I volunteer – maybe because I'm African – this experience has been very helpful in my life. It was after volunteering in Indonesia that I understood that I wanted to study social work. My most recent experience was in Greece; I volunteered two months in a refugee camp in Athens. It is wonderful to be able to get to know other realities through people. The Ubuntu philosophy also taught me that I am because you are, and it is the only way that we can totally accept everyone. For the moment I want to stay in Lisbon and make the most of the opportunities that come along. Lisbon is increasingly more diverse and that is wonderful."
709	Nhung	Viet Nam	Canada	I	N	far	2786	43560	H	im	female	The Vietnam War left our country devastated, with the living conditions worsened by an oppressive communist regime. Seeing no future for her six children in Vietnam, our widowed mother decided to put our fate in God's hands by taking us out to sea in a wooden boat in the hopes of finding freedom from war and poverty. Despite being five years old, I remember sitting on my mother's lap in the belly of a wooden fishing boat, crammed together with 300 other anxious refugees. It was suffocating. We weren't allowed on deck, which was especially hard for my older sister who got extremely seasick from the rough waves that thrashed our boat. For two days we were at sea, enclosed in thick, sour air. However, we were the lucky ones because we learned afterwards that the boat that had departed just minutes before ours had crashed at sea taking the lives of all on board. When our family arrived in Canada, we were warmly received by a group of sponsors. My first impression was one of great joy when one of our sponsors' children gave me a doll at the airport. The doll was a symbol of the kindness and generosity of so many Canadians. These sponsors went on to play a key role in helping us make Canada our home. To this day, we remain grateful to them, and for nearly forty years they have remained our dearest friends. I wanted to honor them by paying forward this kindness and generosity. Seeing and hearing the news of the ongoing desperation of the Syrian refugees made it difficult for many of us here to sleep at night. I didnt know how to help, but then I remembered what Mother Teresa said and that was you can do no great thing, only small things with great love. That gave me clarity to help sponsor two Syrian refugee families to give them hope and freedom. Fortunately, I was surrounded by many amazing friends who were eager to help. Together, we were able to partner with the Mennonite Centre of Canada to bring over the two families.  I feel a poignant connection to the larger family, which is why I brought a little doll for the youngest daughter, Alma.  Perhaps in forty years, my friends and I can look back and say that, in this one moment in time, we did make Canada and the world a little better. It has been wonderful so far. The families are so kind and gracious, and we look forward to seeing the children blossom as they make our country even more beautiful. I want to live in honor of their kindness by living a purposeful life congruent with the values instilled in me. My mother taught me that people can take everything away from you, but they cannot take away your education. I see education as the key to a creating a more equal society free from hatred, ignorance, injustice and poverty. Hence, as a medical doctor, I identify education as one of the most important factors for improving public health. Because my friends and I know how important education is in making this world better, we founded the Children of Vietnam Benevolent Foundation in 2013.  It is a registered Canadian charity with the mission to help, through education, give hope and opportunities to the impoverished children of Vietnam. Although I am a proud Canadian, I cannot ignore the fact that so many of our little brothers and sisters who remained in Vietnam are still living in poverty, after all these years. Because of the many blessings we have in our life in Canada, the purpose of the Foundation is to work to pay forward and honor the kindness and generosity we ourselves received.
710	Nicolas	France	Mauritania	E	A	far	38959	1702	L	im	male	"I grew up with a house full of people because my parents loved to host foreign students. Once we hosted a student from Mauritania who showed us his beautiful pictures from home. The next summer, we were going there on holiday and my mum fell in love with the country. That is how our relationship with Mauritania started. For ten years Mauritania was Nicolass holiday destination until he decided to open a restaurant on the beach, called The Sultan, and settled down. The slower pace of society, the altruism of the people, and cosmopolitism were the ingredients that got Nico passionate about this place and kept him here until today. This is the door to the desert, so this country has always known migratory flows. You can find people from every corner of the world and that is priceless. Mauritanians are able to get the best of each culture that passes through here. Similarly, Nicos restaurant hosts people from all over the world every day, including locals, toubabs (Europeans), Africans, and Asians. It is important for me that my clientele stays cosmopolitan. I am not interested in having a place just for expats. It is so beautiful to look at children of all colours playing together. It is a rainbow of smiles; its magic! This meeting of cultures starts in his kitchen. I call it the Sultans National Team. There are people from everywhere. Its a nice melting pot. It is such a beautiful human experience. My colleagues do not necessarily have previous work experience in the food industry but thanks to their efforts and passion they managed to learn and now they do a great job. I have learnt a very important thing: human qualities are more important than certificates. Before coming to Mauritania, Nico had a hard time finding his place in society. Mauritania was a second chance for me. Migrating allowed me to test and discover myself. I could open myself to the world and finally become the person I wanted to be or simply, another person."
711	Nicolas	France	Thailand	E	I	far	38959	7189	L	im	male	I'm originally from France, but now I live in Thailand where I work as an E-commerce manager. Before that, I used to live in Australia, where I went to join my mother at 17. I had been there as a visitor before I made the move so it wasn't a big discovery, but I would say that I have a much better understanding of the country now. Migration just means being in a country other than your own, it's what you make of the experience that will define its impact on your life. I maintain links to France via the customers that I work with in my current job, but there are still things that I miss from home, including the food! On a more practical level, there were some challenges that I faced with my move to Thailand, a big one was getting my work permit here. But I'm glad that it worked out because home is wherever I can make money. I'm now in a position to bring my diverse background and skills to my new community. I would advise anyone to come to Thailand — it's a nice place to live.
712	Nicole	United States	Portugal	N	E	far	63123	22413	E	im	female	Before coming to Portugal to study, I was told: 'They greet people like in Latin America, with kisses on the cheeks!' I am from the United States and grew up in a Salvadorian and Cuban household in California. I was quite nervous before coming to Portugal, as I had never really been abroad besides going to nearby Tijuana, in Mexico. I had no idea what to expect from moving to Europe, and to a country where I did not speak the language. I have felt very welcomed here. Coming from the American West Coast, I thought my home was a laid back place, but I have found Portugal to be even more relaxed! I love the Portuguese quality of life, especially how Portuguese people take time to have dinner together. Spending time together is a tradition here, both indoors and outdoors. In the U.S you work all the time and sometimes it is barely enough to survive. You cant spend the time with friends and family as you would like. However, I get very frustrated sometimes because there are certain tasks that could be done very quickly, but then you end up needing two hours to do them in Lisbon. I think I have grown to become a more patient person while living here. I am used to taking my car to the store back home in California, but here I dont have a car, so I find myself using public transportation. Im either waiting for the metro or chasing after the bus. Lisbon is a vibrant and colorful city, with character and history. In Portugal, you have buildings and streets that are hundreds of years old and castles almost everywhere. Wherever you walk, youre walking into a piece of history and for me thats always a wow factor. My favorite place in Portugal is the island of Madeira — it combines everything one can find in a city with the beauty of nature! The most difficult aspect of living in Lisbon for me has been the language. I speak Spanish, but its hard to improve my Portuguese accent and speaking because everyone is always so polite and immediately begins speaking in English with me when they hear me stumble upon my words. The most difficult Portuguese word for me is: Espelho — with that particular lhe sound – and my favorite expression is: Ah, pois!. It is not easy to move to a different part of the world. I miss the selection of food from home, especially Salvadorian and Cuban cuisine. I also really miss my family, friends, and pets. Yet, I know in the back of my mind that if I wanted to go back home I always have that option available to me — I feel very lucky to have that choice.
713	Nicolette	Netherlands	United Kingdom	E	E	close	53334	40718	E	im	female	I grew up in Holland with a French mother and a Dutch father. I was bilingual French/Dutch from the start. As a result, I never felt completely rooted in Holland. My parents both lived through the war. My mother studied German just after the war and was part of a movement of young people that worked for reconciliation between France and Germany. My mother was passionately pro-European. She saw the European Union as a way of avoiding wars within Europe in the future. Probably partly as a result of this upbringing I have always felt European and pro European Union. I learnt four more European languages with varying degrees of fluency. I now consider myself trilingual: English, Dutch, French and I can get by in German, Italian and Spanish. Languages have always held my interest. For me they are more than tools for communication: they are also cultural expressions. To understand a country, I believe one needs to learn its language. From a young age I instinctively knew that one day, I would move abroad. That moment arrived in 1992. I moved to London on 29 February 1992, initially with the idea of staying for a year. And I am still here. In 2006 I married a British man of Scottish descent. It feels comfortable to now feel 100 percent a foreigner rather than the 50 percent foreigner I used to feel when living in Holland. I have had to recognise and learn that once one is a foreigner, one always stays a foreigner. No amount of time spent in a new country can change this. I like this status. It allows me to be my own idiosyncratic self. Strangeness can always be blamed on my being foreign! My life as a classical musician has made me travel all over the world and I have met and played with musicians of many different nationalities. It is my dream to have a world without artificial borders and without weapons.
714	Nidal	Syrian Arab Republic	Bulgaria	M	E	far	890	10058	H	im	male	Nidal moved to Sofia from Syria in 1992. He graduated filmmaking, married a Bulgarian woman, had two children and currently works as a journalist. He makes films and organizes debates on social topics. Nidal also organized a photo exhibition called I Have a Dream to tell the stories of Syrian refugee children. When I arrived here I was the only foreigner in our class. My fellow students had so many questions for me: do we play football, do we live in houses? Sometimes I would make a little joke about it, saying we live in tree houses and ride camels. In the end we always found common ground to talk about because we all want to take care of each other. I miss my family and friends in Syria. Sometimes I also miss the traditional Syrian cooking and ingredients. I do not feel as a complete foreigner here since there are a lot of similarities between Bulgaria and Syria. The two countries know a lot about each other. Even before considering moving I visited Bulgaria almost every summer. In Syria we always saw Bulgaria as a borderline between the East and West. The hardest part about moving is getting used to the new place. You know you are an outsider and it takes time to become accustomed and fit in again. This process does not only happen when moving to different countries, but also when moving to a different neighborhood for example. You have to get to know new people and their way of living. I feel at home in both countries. I have spent some of the most memorable years of my life in Bulgaria. On the other hand I do feel strongly connected to my Syrian roots. We live in a multicultural world - there is no country that only has its native citizens. It is so important that we get to know each other and each others different cultures. It is very important that a person has stable roots, but you also have to open the windows of your home to let the sunshine and the different cultures come in.
715	Nicholas	United Kingdom	Honduras	E	L	far	40718	2406	L	im	male	"Between 2008 and 2010, I was working with the Refugee Council in the UK. I loved the role, but due to a change in government I was told that a bulk of the employees would be made redundant and I would be probably be in that group. I went to Spain for a summer working on a campsite near Girona. Later on, I went to Madrid to learn Spanish while writing articles for an English speaking newspaper for expats in the city. I had travelled to Brazil a few years before, so I wasnt completely new to the Latin American culture. I originally planned to spend the year with a project in Colombia but I was advised about Casa Alianza, which supports street kids. It was the challenge I was looking for and so I came to Tegucigalpa. I met my Honduran wife and remained here. All I knew about this country was their poor human rights issues, which made it a challenge and something I wanted to experience. I was enthusiastic and interested in trying everything. Settling into work was challenging though due to visa requirements and workers rights. Every day in Honduras remains unpredictable. While working with Casa Alianza Honduras, I was a teacher, outreach worker, journalist, and I also accompanied them to clinics, prisons, lawyer offices, work placements. By giving Hondurans English classes, new ways of thinking to express themselves and behave; I suppose I improved their thought process. I also did a lot of counselling. Im currently editing a book which I wrote with the street kids about life in the street, immigration and gangs. which will be published online. The children do not always have confidence to tell other Hondurans about their experiences. They trust foreigners far more, so writing a book and letting them tell their stories enabled them to release a lot of negativity and think positively. I have very mixed feelings about going back to live in the UK. I try to visit Birmingham once a year. I miss the food, the seasons, family and friends, especially events like weddings, birthdays and Christmas. I can still be in contact with the culture, thanks to newspapers and the internet. I remain to speak regularly with friends and family with the help of todays technology."
716	Niko	Albania	United Kingdom	E	E	close	5181	40718	H	im	male	I was born in Albania but found myself in England on my own at the age of 13, due to devastating circumstances. I was unable to speak a word of English, I claimed asylum and was put into care. I found being in a new country without the language really difficult, it was a very traumatic time for me. Soon after my move, I discovered the sport of martial arts and it completely changed my life. At 17 years old I started working full time as a Martial Arts instructor teaching people of all ages, the youngest being just two years old, and I never looked back since. I came to love martial arts and was really inspired by it and the way it helped me overcome my own difficulties and I am so proud to be able to pass those skills on to the next generation. I hold British titles in kickboxing and MMA and when I fight abroad I fight for Britain, as this is my home. Martial arts helps people overcome issues such as low self-esteem, lack of confidence, emotional difficulties due to bullying or other circumstances and lack of physical or emotional control. As someone who got truly influenced by martial arts facing my own difficulties, I can really empathize with the people I teach and find their achievements truly humbling. The best part about my job is working with the kids, there is nothing better than seeing a child who really struggled become a young adult in control of themselves. The joy it brings me to see them get their awards or new belts, and the pride they have in themselves and each other is indescribable. I have a beautiful wife who lives back in Albania as unfortunately due to current immigration law she is not able to join me here. This is really hard, but the fantastic kids I teach and my wonderful friends help me get through it. I feel that despite my difficult childhood I have let the negativities shape me in a positive way to become the happy, inspirational person I am today.

The sisters recently enrolled to school, in the context of the educational programme for refugee and migrant children staying in Greece. I look forward to go to school, I want to learn how to speak Greek, says Nilab, the oldest of the three girls. I have attended school in Afghanistan for a few years and today I will start at the secondary school, while my sisters will attend the elementary school. Im a little sad that we wont be together but at the same time, Im excited I will be in the classroom again, its a long-awaited day for me. Their dad is constantly on their side, just like many other parents, proudly watching the preparations for the first day to the Greek school. We came from Afghanistan to Greece more than a year ago. We spent 10 months at the hot spot of Moria, on the island of Lesbos and five months ago we were transferred here, at Oinofyta. Its a big day for us today, their mother and I are really happy that our daughters will go to school. Weve been in Greece for a long time now and the girls have not attended school so far. Being pupils is going to be very good for them, they will learn many useful things. After all, it is crucial for the children to attend the educational system of the country where they live.
718	Niloofar	Iran	Germany	M	E	far	11183	45909	E	im	female	My name is Nilofaar, I'm 30 years old and I'm from Iran. I left my home in Iran in 2005. Since then, I've only returned in order to visit my family. The first time when I left home, I was only 19 years old and went to India to study. I have no home in Iran anymore. I had a great time in India, for more than seven years. But it's also not my home. And now, I've been in Berlin for more than two years. But this is also not my home. I'm in kind of a limbo. That's why home is where I feel happy and relaxed. When I first arrived in Berlin, it was the middle of the Christmas holidays, it was very cold, all the shops were closed and the sky was grey. A rather sad atmosphere. Strangely enough, I immediately felt like I knew Berlin, as if I had been there before, which isn't the case. I had never been to Europe before. Nevertheless, I thought 'I've seen this all before'. There are times when you feel like people don't like you. In Germany, people see that I'm not European. Here, I'm perceived as a woman from the Middle East. In India, I was the white woman. Both have advantages and disadvantages. The negative sides mostly come out in connection with bureaucracy. Not so often when you're in personal contact with people. In Iran, we celebrate the beginning of the winter with a very special ceremony. The night of the 21st December to the 22nd December is the longest and darkest night of the year. In Persian, we call it Shabe Yalda. The whole family gets together and for dinner, we mostly serve pomegranates and melons. Pomegranates are a particularly important symbol in the Persian tradition. You see them everywhere, on carpets, handicrafts and paintings. The melons symbolize the summer that has definitely ended. We also read poetry, especially from Hafiz. He's the Iranian Goethe. During the cold season, this celebration gives you an incredible feeling of warmth. So far, I haven't celebrated it in Berlin, but maybe this year.

The four former fishermen had been held captive by Somali pirates alongside 22 others for nearly five years, one of the longest kidnappings by pirates in the Horn of Africa. The men were caught by pirates while sailing near the Seychelles waters in 2012 where they were forced to remain on their ship for over a year, exhausting the food supply they had on board. They forced us to only have two meals a day so they can stretch out the food as much as possible. We got so hungry towards the end, says Sokhem. It was during this time that one of the other fishermen died of illness while out in sea. Eventually their boat sank and they were moved to Galmudug state in central Somalia where they lived in as hostages. They would set up these small tents for us and move us every three months so we never knew exactly where we were said Sokhem. Initially, the pirates demanded a lump sum of USD 20 million for all of the fishermen and later split them up by nationalities and demanded a total of USD 1 million for the Cambodians. I remember getting that first phone call from my son one day who just said Mom, I have been taken by pirates and they are asking for one million. Dont expect to see me again says Ponleaks mother, Chanlina. She quickly ran out to buy more credit for her phone to return the call but also knew that he was right; they had nowhere near that amount of money to pay the ransom. Making matters worse, the fishermen also struggled with communicating with their captors who instead would simply resort to yelling and torment. We both knew a few words in English and over the years we learned some Somali but we never really understood each other. They often would shout and threaten us while shooting in the air to scare us. Back home things were not improving for their families. While my son was taken we all had to pull our weight here at home to make ends meet explains Nimiths mother Kannitha. We all worked in the rice fields and cassava plantations where we made a total of 30,000 Riels (4 USD) per pound which came to only 8,000 Riels for each of us which is not enough Sometimes we would buy only one kilo of rice at a time and ration it for as long as we could recounts Khemeras wife Taevy. Sokhem, last time he heard, his parents living condition had completely deteriorated. When I left, my parents lived with my brothers and sisters but by now they have all been married and moved away leaving our parents alone and they cannot work. Eventually the fishermen were released by the pirates bringing an end to the nearly five year long ordeal. When they saw their families and loved ones again for the first time it was all tears and cries of joy. Words could not measure how much they were missed. The biggest shock of all came to Khemera when he saw his daughter, Neary, again. When he left she was just seven years old and now she is closer to turn 12. On my worst days I would often look at the photo I had of her which I put under my pillow before going to sleep. I couldnt imagine how she would look like now but when I finally saw her again she was just as beautiful as I imagined she would be. When asked why the men worked as overseas fishers they had the same explanation as millions of other Cambodians. Our families have always been poor living in tough conditions and when we heard that fishermen made a good amount of money, we jumped onto that chance Now that they are finally home, the former fishermen are uncertain about their future and how to resume the life theyve had on hold for nearly five years. One thing is for certain, none of these men want to ever leave Cambodia for work ever again.   Khemera shows the photos he held onto during his five year captivity including the last photo he took of his daughter Neary which he regularly slept with under his pillow. *names have been changed"
720	Nimrod	Israel	Israel	M	M	close	47034	47034	E	hc	male	I was born in Jerusalem. At the age of 25, I traveled to France and then to Italy because Israel did not have what I needed to be able to do what I love: pantomime and circus. I was looking to discover, improve, and go deeper into the art of nonverbal communication. I was always interested in the communication possibilities that transcend differences in language and identity. From a very young age I wanted to make jokes that everyone could relate to. I wanted to be international. I just wanted to be a part of the human family and to find and to develop this art. If you are willing to go search for what is common for everybody you will find it.  And you will find that we are all really the same. Of course, we have a whole cultural structure to differentiate us but I wanted to find what can bring us together. I remember the first day in Italy I came and I sat in a pizzeria and I looked at the menu and I said to myself I need to understand all this to live here? I dont understand a word! I was terrified. That experience almost made me pack up and continue to another place. In Paris, it was even worse. I didnt understand anything. I felt like an idiot and a failure a million times just because of the language. It continued like that.  I made so many mistakes all the time. Some of it was really depressing, but some of it was actually the adventure I came here for. It gave me strength to believe that one day I could understand this language. And thanks to pantomime, I could understand everything without speaking a word of French or Italian. I am now a. therapeutic clown, or a dream doctor. Being a medical clown gives me great joy to be able to also use my personal story. Today I can connect with people that I meet and work with because I know where they are coming from. Being a migrant, even one who chooses to be a migrant, has deep emotional effects. The clowns point of view can help one address problems and obstacles in an agreeable way. When it works it just helps their journey in life.   The Dream Doctors are an independent association working mainly with children in hospitals since 2002. They are active during crises, national emergencies and natural disasters throughout the world, attempting to reach the injured population to prevent the development of post-trauma.

I got my permanent resident visa after only two years, which allowed me to bring my wife and daughter over here. When I left, I was travelling out of Mauritius for the first time. I came to Canada looking for a better future. I started off working in the food industry until I joined a cab company I still work for. As a cab driver, I get to meet and talk to many people and most of the time we end up having a conversation about my origin. They really like learning about the habits and values of another country. Most of the time, they look up Mauritius on their phone and ask me why I left a tropical island. I love travelling to new places but I also enjoy living here because I am surrounded by people from diverse cultures. Canada is a country that welcomes migrants from everywhere. It gives people the opportunity to work, study and do anything else in a safe environment. Whether theyre here to study or work, Ive never heard anyone complain about the way they are treated here. Canadians are very open-minded and friendly people. I didnt know how to speak English properly when I came to Canada so I took English classes and now, even though Im fluent Im still afraid of making mistakes. But Canadians are helpful and considerate. They dont laugh at you and try to understand. Im happy with my life. I came here with 100 dollars and now I have my own house, a Canadian passport and I can travel anywhere in the world. I can decide to go back to my island to visit my family anytime. Even though I left, I still love Mauritius; the land where I was born. I will never forget that."
722	Noam	Israel	Germany	M	E	far	47034	45909	E	im	male	My name is Noam, I come from Israel. I came to Europe to follow my love for music. I first came to Netherlands to study in the conservatoire, I travelled after my songs wherever they took me. This was my dream as a child. When people asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up Id say I want to travel the world with my music. I feel lucky that this is happening now because Im living my dream. I came to the Netherlands because I was invited to do a study period together with a special internship with the conservatoire orchestra which is from the top five orchestras in the world so I couldnt say no. When I arrived here my visa wasnt approved and I lost my internship but I did manage to do the study period with the conservatoire. After passing this year I decided to stay in Europe because I felt I had more identification for the music I create in Europe than back home, especially because I was singing in English. It was a bit frowned upon if youre Israeli and youre singing in another language than in Hebrew, so I wanted to experience more with English speaking audience. I got my first permit five months after arrival, which I had to renew after nine months, but they didnt actually renew it so I had to go back to Israel for two years. From home I did an audition for an artists agency in Germany and on that basis I was granted an artist visa to Germany. Thats where I currently live. When I first came to these countries I realised some differences from my home country. Things like food tastes and the weather. Also in Israel Im considered really tall but in the Netherlands they called me the little one. Apart from that I feel like people are people, so I didnt really feel a change of concept. Im an artist so for me where my art is, my heart is, and as the cliché goes where my heart is, my home is. My current album Love Migration  is about where you feel at home, where you feel okay with yourself, questions like am I a migrant, am I an expat. I hope to create identification with people through my personal story and humanise migration through my music. Its not about them and us, were all human beings and I try to say that through my songs. I recently wrote a song called Well see each other at the shore where I describe a family of refugees crossing the ocean in a boat and all their experiences throughout the journey. For me to say the difference between an expat and a migrant is difficult. For example when Im on stage Im automatically an expat, because Im viewed as a professional, highly educated, articulate, but when Im on the bus just wearing a coat people see me as a migrant, wandering if Im going to steal something or why Im smiling or looking in a certain way. Immigration for me is just a story, its the story of my life and of many other peoples lives. Ive been in this story for 30 years now so thats a long time, and theres a lot more to come.

After leaving Serbia we went to New York for four years; I was in school, I used to go to the theatre after school sometimes and I could go into the city to hang out with my friends. We would go to museums and do all kinds of different activities — sightseeing, biking around Central Park and ice skating were some of my favorite hobbies. Ive only been in Switzerland for a year, since 2016, so Im still discovering the city. Migration means moving, adapting to new places, and becoming more cultured, because of all the different experiences you go through. I would apply the term migrant to myself because Ive moved around a lot, and I feel like Ive become quite flexible and open-minded because of it, but Ive realized that I cant really set my roots down in one place. If I make a really good friend, we can be friends for four years or maybe a bit more, but after that I know that Im going to move on so its a bit hard to have a grounded friendship. I go to an international school here in Geneva, and I know that many of the people around me will end up leaving too so I have to make many different friends. But Im an extrovert and Im quite social so its not too hard, but I always try to make the most of the friendships that I do have. All the different technologies available also make it easier for me to keep in touch with people after they leave or after I do. Home is a place you can go to feel safe, and you have friends and family there. Even though Ive moved, I still think New York is home — I miss the liveliness and the diversity there. You could see everything in one day, all kinds of different things and people, and I miss the skyscrapers too. I need to experience Geneva more and get to know my classmates better to feel more settled here because Im still quite new. Theres a positive side and a negative side to migration: the negative side is that its hard to make friendships that will last forever because you know youre going to move. The positive part is that you become more cultured and enriched by the experience, and hopefully you can pay that forward wherever you go next."
724	Noor	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	female	My name is Noor and Im 20 years old. I come from the city of Deir Ez-Zor in Syria. The war drove me and my family away from our homeland, four years ago. I graduated from high school but the war and being constantly on the move as a refugee have robbed me of the opportunity to get to the University. This is what I plan to do now, in the Netherlands, where I will relocate. I will apply for the medical school. Ever since I was a little girl I wanted to study medicine, I remember dreaming about wearing the white robe. My inspiration are my two uncles, both medical doctors, and I see myself following their footsteps. I really havent decided yet what kind of doctor Id like to become, but I still have time to make up my mind. I like my life in Europe, despite the hardships. People are simple, just like in Syria and its a very safe place. I see myself adapting easily to the Netherlands, the way I have adapted myself here in Greece. As much as I cant wait to get to the Netherlands and a new beginning, I will definitely get back to Greece someday, hopefully on holidays, as Ive seen so many beautiful places here that Id like to explore.
725	Noufal	India	Kuwait	I	M	far	1931	24809	H	im	male	With the help of my brother, I came to Kuwait in September 2003 when I was 23 years old. After I worked for a period of time with my sponsor, I later  joined the International Organization for Migrations' mission in Kuwait in February 2004. Adjusting to the culture in Kuwait was not very difficult for me as I respect all people of different cultures. Sometimes I remember my home country and my entire family and children. I have dreams for better living conditions and supporting my family and relatives. Of course, I deeply miss my wife and children the most but now the leaving cost and rent of the apartment is too high that I cannot save money as I easily as I had thought. Before I used to think that I can earn money and leave Kuwait within 5 years. Now I am 36 and my dreams seem very far. I pray to god all mighty that this country will prosper but India will always be my home.
726	Nour	Syrian Arab Republic	Italy	M	E	far	890	31238	H	im	female	My name is Nour. I am 31 and I am Syrian. I was working in the department of microbiology in the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria. My husband Hasan and I decided to leave Syria because he was asked to join the military service, but we didnt want to take any side so we didnt have another choice – we had to go. When we left, we wanted to bring many things with us, but when you travel in an illegal way, you cant bring anything with you. We could take only the things that were needed for the baby. We wanted to bring our families, our clothes, our laptops, and my hairdryer – a lot of things. I left all my life behind me. So you can imagine how hard it is. It is difficult when you move to another country with a small amount of luggage. Imagine when you are moving to another country with nothing, because I couldnt bring anything. Here in Rome we dont miss Syrian food too much because we can actually prepare and cook it ourselves. We find the ingredients and the spices in the supermarkets, where we can buy food using the food vouchers or the card that we have been given. The card is recharged regularly. If the supermarkets dont have the ingredients or the spices, we can find them in some Egyptian or Arabic shops. It is easy. We like pizza and my son Ziad enjoys his pasta with just some olive oil. He is funny, he likes to eat with other children, not with us! When we arrived, thanks to the SantEgidio Community, my son started attending the kindergarten of the Community. He loved playing with other children so much and I used to watch him from upstairs, from the flat where we stayed for a few weeks as guests of the SantEgidio Community. After a while we moved to another flat, still in the center of the city. It is very nice. We have refugee papers now. They are valid for five years and we can travel with those documents, even if we still dont have our passports. Wed like to stay in Italy, for now, then well see.
727	Novi	Indonesia	United States	I	N	far	3870	63123	H	im	female	I was born in Indonesia. I love my country but between 1998 through 2008 the situation there became uncertain because of riots and bombings. People in my country were fed up: The president was in power for 32 years and many of my nationals were ready for change. In 2000, it struck close to home, when my office, the Jakarta Stock Exchange, was targeted and bombed. People were getting nervous and scared. I decided it was time for me to move somewhere safe. My husband, who was then a client of mine when I worked as a stock trader, sent me an email from the US that said: Someday I will come back for you. And he did. We got married in 2007 in Jakarta. I didnt want to leave behind my family and friends and I worried about having to start over and about my English skills. Even though I didnt feel ready to move to America, we left for the US shortly after.  When I first moved to America, I felt extremely overwhelmed. It was cold, I didnt have a job, spoke little English and for the first time experienced culture shock. In Indonesia people are more laid back, talk more openly. Americans seemed to be busy and always in a rush.  At a party one night, I met a friend of my husbands who was a bit chubby and I thought she was pregnant. I didnt think twice when I asked her if she was pregnant, when my husband stepped on my foot. Even then, I wasnt sure what I had done wrong. I hadnt realized that I couldn't say everything I was thinking. Besides a few funny episodes like this, I have to say that I have grown to like America. Its a cool place to live in. After a while, I felt the need to present and promote Indonesia as a safe country and inform Americans about the different cultures of the various Indonesian islands. I eventually opened an Indonesian store in Buffalo, Sasmita Batik. My first year in business was really difficult but I worked hard. Everyday I would wake up, distribute flyers and then go to work in my store. My hard work has paid off, I am now happy with my life in Buffalo.
728	Novruz	Albania	Albania	E	E	close	5181	5181	E	hc	male	Novruz and his brother are quite famous in their village. They are the DJ and singer to call for every event: weddings, anniversaries, baptisms, etc. Even the municipality and the local school hire them from time-to-time for some events such as national or religious celebrations. Katund i Ri is a village in the western part of Albania. The road leading to the village is newly paved and the migrants remittances contributed to the presence of nice-looking houses on both sides of the main road. Farming and agriculture are main income generating activities in the area, but remittances remain a strong contributor to the local economy. Novruzs father works in the familys plot and also as an occasional agricultural worker in Greece. Novruzs mother receives a small pension due to the familys large number. He lives with his three brothers, two sisters and three sisters-in-law. The male family members occasionally work in construction, while the women take care of the house and of a 3 year old nephew. With his job as a DJ, Novruz contributes to the family budget, especially during summer when many people living abroad come back to the village to get married. Many villagers have immigrated especially to the UK. Novruz also tried to go to the UK in November 2014. He flew to the Netherlands but at the Rotterdam port before taking the ferryboat he was found with an Italian fake passport. At that time he was a minor so consequently he was sent to a reception community for unaccompanied minors and got included in a voluntary return program. Several steps were taken in order to ensure his normal reintegration in Albania, such as the family tracing conducted in Tirana. IOM supported Novruzs return and reintegration and helped with the purchase of the DJ set and kit, allowing him to restart his dream job. I've always loved music and I was fascinated by musicians. I love to contribute with music and celebrate happy moments for my people. Nevruz has kept only one memory of his shortlived stay in the Netherlands, a Christmas tree that he won at a raffle and that he keeps in the living room as a souvenir.
729	Nowrouz	Afghanistan	Afghanistan	I	I	close	508	508	E	hc	male	"Mohammed Nowrouz Noori is an Afghan man in his late 30s but he is already a broken man. In January this year he set off with his wife Nilufar, son Mohammad and baby daughter Nastaran from the Turkish coast heading for Greece. When we were boarding my son said 'Dad I have prayed that we reach to other side safely', Nowrouz says as he recounts the tragedy at the family home back in Kabul. We could see lights from Greece. I reassured him, saying 'tonight is the last night of our troubles'. But the boat arranged by people smugglers soon got into trouble and capsized. In a matter of seconds water was everywhere, filling the boat. It was dark. I lost my children and my wife who had been sitting next to me, Nowrouz says. At least 39 migrants, including several children drowned that day. Nowrouz was among more than 60 rescued, What came next was a 12-day struggle to recover the bodies of his loved ones and bring them home for burial. Nowrouz says he received medical treatment in a camp on the Turkish coast where police showed him photos of bodies which had been recovered. I saw my family's pictures there, he says. I saw the photo of my one-year-old daughter, my six-year-old son and my wife who was 25. I lost them. A police officer asked whether Nowrouz intended to bury his family in Turkey or take them home. After phoning relatives he decided the family should be buried in Kabul. The next day a minibus took Nowrouz and other survivors to Istanbul where he turned to the Afghan consulate for help. They said that I have to repatriate the bodies myself, he says. Nowrouz spent days calling relatives back home. I had to borrow money to repatriate my family back to Afghanistan, he says. But once in his country, he could find only the bodies of his wife and son; his baby daughter was missing. With flights arranged he had little choice but to leave her behind to be buried in one of Bursa's cemeteries. I wanted to bring my daughter's body to Afghanistan too, Nowrouz says, but because the whole process took so long I couldn't find her. Compounding the heartbreak of losing his family, he now has debts to worry about as well. Having borrowed $8,500 to cover the costs of the ordeal, Nowrouz has been left bankrupt by a journey that already cost him everything.   By Firuz Rahimi, BBC World Service"
730	Nozary	Iran	Greece	M	E	far	11183	18117	E	im	male	I came to Greece on August 2017. My parents were against my decision to leave Iran as I had already started studying informatics and I wasnt having any sort of problems in my country. My goal was to fulfill my dream of exploring Europe and integrate there. When I arrived on Samos Island, the truth is I got scared. I arrived at the reception centre where many people of different nationalities where already staying there. In time, I like the island and its people, I made friends. I thought it would be nice to live in Greece. The months went by and I started thinking of my family and friends in Iran through the hardships I faced. I was missing them a lot. I was already aware of IOMs AVRR programme and I took the decision to return to my country. The thought of being back again with my family and friends makes me really happy as well as the new beginning in Iran after this experience I had. However, I will never forget the friends I made here.
731	Nyaban and Nyabi	South Sudan	South Sudan	A	A	close	1421	1421	E	hc	n	Sisters Nyban and Nybi lost their homes on 18 February during an attack on the UN protection of civilians (PoC) site near South Sudans Malakal town, where they are seeking shelter from the civil that erupted in December 2013. The sisters are former locals of Malakal town, with their own families, children, husbands and independent lives. Years before the war broke out in Upper Nile State, Nyban and Nyabi both lost their husbands to illnesses and, since then, they have relied on each other for support as they raised their children together.  Before all of this chaos started, we would collect firewood to sell in the local markets and thats how we managed to make ends meet for our families, they said. By the time that the battlefront came to their doorstep in Malakal, they decided, like many others, to leave their homes in late 2013 to seek shelter and protection within the nearby UN compound. After more than two years of living in the Pic site, their lives were again forcibly changed on the night of 17 February 2016, when fighting erupted in the site. We remember the night of the attack. It was the shouting that woke us up. When we heard the fighting and shooting start, we were worried for our lives and started to pack our things, recalls Nybi. The fighting led to a massive fire that swept through much of the site. At night, we heard the fire start from very far away but then it began to spread. We saw it slowly creep closer towards us over night. We could not sleep. By morning, the fire got too close to their homes and they were forced to flee the path of the fire as it consumed their homes along with several of their neighbours and friends. Everything we had is lost. Nearly all of our belongings, our clothes, jewellery, and whatever else that we brought from our live in Malakal are reduced to ashes. Now, Nyban and Nybi collect the scraps of their homes in hopes of being able to rebuild their temporary shelter until security improves and they are able to resume their lives outside the PoC site.
732	Nyadet	Sudan	Kenya	A	A	close	1415	1879	E	im	female	At 84 years old, Nyadet is one of the oldest refugees living in Dadaab refugee camps. After surviving years of conflict in her country, she fled South Sudan in 2013. She found out three months after her arrival that her granddaughter whom she had never met was also living in the same refugee camp. When we met for the first time, it was wonderful and we were both so happy we cried the whole day. Her granddaughter, Rebecca, is one of a handful of girls training at Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation in Nairobi as part of a program to train elite refugee athletes for international competitions, including the Olympics. When the civil war started, Sudan separated and the mother and father of Rebecca moved to Ethiopia, which is where Rebecca was born. People began to go back to Sudan, but the tension between North and South Sudan caused another war to breakout, during which Rebeccas father was killed. After he was killed, another tribe attacked their village, causing Rebecca to run away. Born in 1932, Nyadet had lived her whole life in Sudan. She has six children, but today is not sure where any of them are now and if they are still alive. During the time I grew up, the culture didnt allow women to go to school. Now, culture knows education is important. Instead of going to school, we were taking care of the cattle. Once the war broke out, we lost everything. Nyadet holds great hope for Rebecca to improve the lives of those in her family. I hope she can finish school and what she is doing now, then she can have a bright future. I hope she also looks for the other children in the family because we dont know where they are now. While Nyadet did not have the opportunity to go to school or play sports, her understanding and support for Rebeccas endeavors in education and sport are steadfast. Sports are good for girls. Before, the country would not allow it, but now what a man can do, a girl can too. If they can make it to the professional level, you know youll have a bright future. We were very happy for her to have this opportunity to make it and continue her education. I was very happy and thanked God for giving Rebecca this chance. The opportunity is not for Rebecca alone. If she makes it to the higher levels she will be okay. Now that she has this opportunity, she needs to work hard to succeed.
733	Nyambuoy	South Sudan	South Sudan	A	A	close	1421	1421	E	hc	male	My passion in life is education. It is the gateway to everything I want to achieve. My dream is to become a surgeon. South Sudan has so few surgeons. If I can finish my education and realise my dream it would make me very proud. But the crisis and my status as an internally displaced person (IDP) have interrupted my dream for now. Nyambuoy is an IDP being sheltered at the UN Protection of Civilians (PoC) site in Bor, the capital city of Jonglei State in South Sudan. Restarting my education has been difficult within the site. When we first moved here we were without a school. After some months, the community arranged for a learning space for primary students, although it was very basic. Later, after we moved into the new site, we found a new school and were able to start studying again in earnest. I am getting ready to take my Primary Leaving Certificate examinations. My favourite subject is Science as this will take me toward my goal of becoming a surgeon. I hope to take a degree in biology when we are at peace. As I approach graduation from primary school I face some serious problems. My class has no textbooks for P8 and I have nothing with which to revise apart from my notes. When I pass my exams I will face an uncertain future. There is no secondary school in the camp and therefore no access to formal education. I worry that my education will again be interrupted. For now, I take great pride in the fact that I can read and write. If someone writes to me I do not need someone to read it for me. If I write a letter, I can write it myself. My secrets are my own again. I also take solace in being part of the volleyball team. It allows me to stay active so I do not dwell on my problems. We practice often and play games against other teams. I have got to the position of team captain, and I take this responsibility very seriously. It is important for me to display leadership qualities and to take care of my team. If they quarrel, I calm them. If they need to increase their skills, I train them. I try to set the example for my team. Education and sport form the bedrock of my life in Bor. I pray that I will continue to be able to play and learn in order to achieve my dreams. Nyambuoy participates now in IOMs psychosocial support programme as part of the sports group and captain of the volleyball team.

In Zavkhan Province, Nyamdulams family had over 300 head of livestock including sheep, yack, camels, cows and horses. Zavkhan province was heavily affected by the harsh dzuds* of 1999 and 2001. Like many families in the region, Nyamdulam and her family lost the bulk of their livestock in those two years. They struggled to recover, and continued to lose livestock in each subsequent year. In 2007, the last of their livestock died. After we lost our livestock, we moved to the soum (sub region) center, trying to collect salt to make a living. Most of the people in our soum were also affected by the dzud, and lots of other families were doing the same. We werent earning enough to cover our daily needs. In 2010, we made the decision to move to Ulaanbaatar. We had no choice but to move, it was a very difficult decision. Once we arrived, it was difficult to settle down. We didnt know people; we didnt know how life in Ulaanbaatar worked, or how to find a job. We had been herders our whole lives. Everything was different. We came here with the whole family, including my sisters and two brothers. We lived in a small dormitory, with a shared living space. I found work keeping the coal heaters in the dormitory going throughout the night, my mother was working as an apartment guard and cleaner. Living in the public dormitory for two years, we didnt register our new residence with the local authorities, so the children couldnt go to kindergarten. My brothers did not like living here. They moved back to the countryside to find work herding other peoples animals for a salary. Now its only the women and children here. Things are much better for us now. We know many people, and understand how life works. I'm a senior officer at the Khorro (local government) and all of my children are in school. In Zavkhan, there are lakes and very nice mountains. We miss our winter camp, and our autumn camp. It was very difficult to move. Now our dream is to have our own yard and own ger. *dzud is a cyclical slow onset event that is unique to Mongolia, characterized by a summer drought in which the growth of fodder is slow, followed by an unusually cold, snowy or icy winter."

His father continued to Italy while his mother is still in Libya. He was only seven months-old when he returned to The Gambia in 2018, accompanied by other returnees. His mother said she could not take care of him anymore, so she asked a friend to help bring him back to The Gambia. It was really challenging for Buba when he came back, as he had some health complications, including a skin infection. I took good care of him, gave him milk to feed on and gave him the motherly love he needed to feel secured and protected. In the first year of his return, we received support to fund his basic needs. I also received support to empower my business, so that I could continue to cater for the needs of Buba. During those days, I did not have much time to take care of the business. I went through sleepless nights, but thank God everything is fine now. just like men, women need to be empowered in order to contribute to the advancement of their families and societies. Buba is now attending the first year at the nursery school and he is very passionate about his schooling. He is a very intelligent kid and he always reads his books and recites the numbers and letters of the alphabet. I want him to continue his schooling, so he can get a good job and be successful in life.

A basketball player? A musician? A superhero? Nope. A dentist. With his own practice. Its not the flashiest of career choices. But Obay, who moved from Damascus, Syria to Brooklyn with his family in 2012 because of the war, wants to be his own boss. He said its a Syrian tradition. People in Syria have a certain pride that they don't like working for others, he said. Obay would be one of many Syrian entrepreneurs in the United States. Eleven percent of Syrian immigrants to the United States own businesses, according a new report from the Fiscal Policy Institute and the Center for American Progress. That compares to four percent of immigrants overall and three percent of people born in the United States. Obays father, Mohamad, owned a manufacturing facility back in Syria and is now a mechanical engineer at a factory in Brooklyn. The Syrian entrepreneurial spirit is borne of necessity, he said. In Syria, when you work for somebody, for a company or for the government, the income is not going to be enough to live a good life, he said. Syrians also drill it into their childrens heads that they have to be self-reliant, because theres little safety net in the country, said Shadi Martini, a Syrian immigrant and a realtor who lives in Michigan. Since we grow up, our parents will tell, dont rely on government. They wont help you. You have to do it by yourself, Martini said. Government is not there for us. Its there for some people who are in high positions and thats it. Martini used to live in Aleppo, where he ran a hospital owned by his family. It was part of a network illegally providing medical care to wounded civilians who opposed the Assad regime. He left Syria in 2012 when that got too dangerous.

He lost his parents a long time ago, and now he only has his brothers and sisters. Three of his siblings are still in the Palestinian Territories, two of them are in Egypt in a part of the country where is still some peace, and the rest are in Great Britain. I was forced to leave home and to choose a country where I could live a good life and study, Oday said. Great Britain would have been a good idea because I knew the language, but there I would need to work for eight hours a day in order to pay for my studies. Here, in Romania, you can study for free. Even though now he is fully integrated in Romania, Oday's main challenge was overcoming the linguistic barrier. When I first came to Romania, I was advised to stay in a smaller, more quiet city, taking into consideration that I didnt know the language at all. After the first year in Craiova, I got used to the place and decided to stay. The first two years were the hardest. After graduating from the Faculty of Medicine in Craiova, Oday found a job in a medical office in the same city, and he is now gaining professional experience his field of choice while helping the local community. Despite the fact that he cannot return to his home country, due to the internal conflict, Oday enjoys the freedom of travelling from Romania to other regions and for this reason he considers himself an extremely fortunate person. I can travel to the EU, to countries where there is no war, to the United States of America and Canada. The same as everyone else! I can't go back to the country that I left because of the conflict. I got out because I had a visa for studies. Everybody wants to leave the country and to find a better life, but not all of them have the chance.
738	Ohene	Ghana	Norway	A	E	far	2206	66871	H	im	male	"When I was eight years old, I decided to run away from home to earn money to pay for my own education. Having been born in Ejisu in Ashanti Region in Ghana to a very poor family, being the second of 12 siblings meant my family could not afford to send all of their children to school. They chose to educate my elder brother and I was to work with my father on his farm. I refused, as I wanted to go to school. For that, l was beaten repetitively for days and weeks. I failed to convince my parents to allow me to go to school and this is when I decided I needed to finance my own schooling. I washed cars, sold various things on the street side of Kumasi and attended school at the same time. After my going through a very hard time, l completed my schooling and joined the Ghana Army. Then, I decided to leave. My destination was Oslo, Norway. A new chapter of life began, full of uncertainty and the unknown. But then again, uncertainly and the unknown have been a part of my daily life. I learned uncertainty is the only certainty there is, and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.  I found out that education was free in Norway and I felt that it was my biggest weapon to success. Coming to Norway was a little like free-falling, I felt I was floating on restless waters but with a firm aim; to achieve what I was denied without knowing how! My first impression when I arrived in Norway was like love at first sight. I was impressed to see how peaceful the country was, how people were living a normal life. They have schools for everyone, education is free, even university. I was amazed to see that parents give a lot of time to their children, taking them out into the wilderness and teaching them about the land and nature. I am thankful to the Seventh Days Adventist Church, at the Tyrifjord SDA Church Senior High School in Hole near Hønefoss. They supported me with all I needed and made me feel at home. They guided me and helped me to overcome the initial culture-shock. I only had a small bag with few clothes as I didnt have much to bring with me from Ghana. However, what I brought with me was my determination to always see the glass half full. I have been living in Norway for almost 33 years. What I miss from my country? I mostly miss my friends. I have now achieved my dreams and have a great education from the University of Agder and University of Oslo. I have proudly worked with the elderly for years. Norway has given me what my own parents denied me. I am privileged to be Norwegian and I am glad to be contributing to this beautiful country. My future would have been different if it had not been Norway. I am grateful to Norway and its people. I came to Norway with only basic education from Ghana and I had to start my life from the scratch. Now, I am well established and living as one of the highly respectable migrants in Norway.

739	Olaf	Indonesia	Papua New Guinea	I	I	close	3870	2640	E	im	male	"As a young student I saw the annexation of my country, West Papua, by Indonesia which had a dramatic impact on my life. As I moved to Jayapura, the capital of West Papua, to pursue my studies, I witnessed how my friends were joining freedom fighting movements to struggle for the independence of our country. I started to get involved and became a courier, distributing information to and from members of the Free Papua Movement in the capital. However, after one of my comrades was captured, my friends and I decided for our own safety to flee West Papua and head to Papua New Guinea (PNG) where we could, at least we thought, continue with our struggle from a safer place where other West Papuans were already operating. So we left in a canoe and started our one-way journey to PNG leaving behind everything we owned, our homes, families and friends. This journey is still ongoing and 30 years have passed without ever returning to my homeland. I spent two years in the jungle of PNG and in 1977 as the Free-Papua Movement split, I asked for political asylum in PNG. In June 1992, my status as a refugee was still not determined. However I became a citizen of PNG when the Foreign Minister Michael Somare granted West Papuans Papuan New Guinean citizenship. My life has not been easy, I still live in a camp but I remain thankful to the Government of Papua New Guinea which has allowed me to live and be free in this country. In the three decades I have lived in PNG I have been able to work, meet my wife and have four children and a grandson. I have constructed a life and a bridge for another generation. I took nothing with me when I started my canoe trip in 1975, just a dream which became a vehicle to carry on. That dream today is centered on my grandson; I want him to have a good education, to become a good citizen of Papua New Guinea."

Olufemi was born in Nigeria, and was sent by his agent to play for one of South Africas big-name teams: Mighty Stars in Limpopo. This was the start of his international career, which should have gone on to bring him fame and fortune. Unfortunately, it didnt. The opportunity was not what he had envisaged and his career came to a sudden and devastating end. Deserted and hopeless, Femi headed to Pretoria to play for a small team in Laudium. Disaster struck yet again however, when, after a short time, he got a permanent severe injury and could not play anymore. I could have easily got involved in drugs to make quick bucks. Everything, and I mean everything, went against me and I was on my own. To keep going I first worked as a hair-salon recruiter; I wandered the streets of central Pretoria recruiting people to come to our salon. I then sold jewelry and slippers. His attempts to explore entrepreneurship as a path in life just didnt work for him. All he wanted to do was to see, touch, breathe and live football. Bothered by a high number of young men both locally and from various African countries wandering the streets, Femi felt compelled to intervene. To do something that would give these young men a new perspective on life – and so Fembem Stars Football Club was born. Since then Femi has built up the 30-strong team from young men drawn from all over Africa. Sport is traditionally an effective compound in promoting unity. My plan was to keep these young men off the streets, give them necessary life skills – basically to re-channel them towards positive things in life. Fembem Stars FC has seen great success over the years, with most of its team members changing their lives for the better. I have members who have had opportunities to enroll at universities and who are doing exceptionally well. One of my former players – a South Africa boy named Thabiso Elliot – is currently playing for a team in New Zealand. Im also currently sealing deals with a couple of well-established teams thriving in the Vodacom league, who are interested in my boys. Femis team is registered under the Department of Trade & Industry (DTI) as Fembem Sports House. Femi is currently exploring other sporting avenues to appeal to young kids. My plan is to establish a sports academy that will produce the best of Africas future stars!"
741	Oluwatobi	Ethiopia	Estonia	A	E	far	840	23106	H	im	male	I heard about Estonia when I was searching for study programs and I decided to apply. I think the Software Engineering program at Tartu University is getting very popular, as the standard and quality of the course is very high. So, I am not surprised to see that this program brings many people here. I came to Estonia on the 25th of September in 2015 and I am working at an IT firm in Tartu. When I came out of the airport it was very, very cold. I was thinking its only September and I am feeling this cold, how will I do in -30? Also, I read that people dont speak to you, so I had this in mind. After being here little over a year, my impressions are mixed. I realized it is about individual ways of socializing with others. Sometimes I dont like to talk and I like to stay on my own but sometimes I like to talk. I respect peoples intentions to either relate or not to relate. I was not too serious about learning Estonian before. Now I am developing a passion for the language and I really want to learn Estonian. I realized and have also read that the Estonian population is dropping. I feel there is a struggle for the Estonian language to survive. I feel it would be good for me to be one of those who could encourage the survival of the language. I want to be part of the environment and have the same mind as the country. Also, I am a Christian, so I naturally want tell Estonians about my faith, about Jesus and what God is doing in my life. It is a bit difficult, because I cant speak with them. I want to be able to help in community work. There was a time I went to school to speak with students, but they didnt understand me. All of this has brought a change in my attitude towards learning a language. In the future I see myself as the lead of an IT firm that contributes to NGO activities in educating children with zero background in software development. I am passionate about working with the youth and children. I want to train children with zero knowledge in IT, to be sought after as an IT specialist.

My first impression of Albania was noticing how clean and mountainous it was; a very different general atmosphere than what I was used to back in Egypt. I only missed my friends and family from home but I enjoyed the new experience and discovering a new culture very much. When I first arrived to Albania I noticed that the Albanian cuisine and traditions are very arab-like, so it wasnt a shock of culture for me. The only difference was the language barrier, which was easy for meto catch up on with time. My goal in the new country was to make new friends from diverse communities and to know every part of the country and become a fluent Albanian speaker. Home for me is Egypt but I also considered Tirana, Albania to be my second home. I like bringing new culture and knowledge abroad as well as learning about them in return. I consider my travel experience to be fruitful because it is important to learn about the diversity of cultures in the world and welcome them into your own."
743	Omar	Iraq	Greece	M	E	far	4146	18117	E	im	male	"I was born in Sargat village, located near Said Sadiq town. I have 13 sisters and 7 brothers and now I am a father of 7 children; Khattab, Hendie, Jiehia, Zakariya, Shahd, Al-Rayyan and little Marina, the 3-month-old newborn baby. My father was a very famous and rich man in Iraq and even though I did not get much love from him, I always knew that I didn't want to raise my kids in the same way. I started to work at my mothers market, selling sweets, while I was studying engineering in college. When I completed my studies I got a job as an engineer in an American oil company operating in Duhok. I was a hardworking businessman, I had a good job and a decent income, but since ISIS was coming to my village, I had to protect myself and my family. This is why I decided to leave. First I bought a house in Sulaimaniya governorate, one of the major cities in Iraqi Kurdistan. However, ISIS attacked us and the city was almost destroyed. I was robbed and I lost everything I had, including my car and my savings. After that incident, I realized that the situation was unstable and dangerous for my family so I made the decision to leave. My wife took care of our children and I went to Egypt. I bought a house there in order to travel to Iraq and work, when necessary. Every week I was traveling from Egypt to Iraq and back. But this lasted only a few weeks. Egypt was not a safe choice either. I returned to my home town, from where I took my family and travelled to Turkey. We stayed there for 60 days. Our next stop was Orestiada, Greece, in April 2017. Being safe and finding a job were my top priorities. I was thinking that the best place for us to make a new start was Belgium or Germany, since they have great achievements in technology and science. I tried to find a job there with no results. Greece is how I had imagined it; amazing weather, 100% safety and nice people. My children were really excited to attend school every day. Unfortunately, our income remained low. The price of one carton of milk for babies is 9 euros and my little daughter needs 5 of them per month. Even in Greece I was struggling to cover our basic needs. Meanwhile, I stayed in close contact with my friends back home. A few days ago, I was informed that ISIS has left and although my house was completely destroyed I decided to go back. My next step was to call IOM and find out more details about voluntary returns. Somehow, I knew that my future is there, in my home country."
744	Omar	Niger	Niger	A	A	close	568	568	E	hc	male	Back in 2016, during one quiet afternoon, a bomb fell on our mosque during a funeral. Around 40 people died and 36 were hurt that day. I was about 50 metres away from where it happened. We were devastated, but we kept calm and we stayed. To this day, I cant begin to understand what happened. Five months later, Boko Haram attacked the military base next to us. Together with my wife and four children, we left our village and went to Bosso. Plenty others followed, by car or on foot. Once they started attacking Bosso, we left for a little village near Diffa. Once they attacked that one as well, we went by foot to another village near Bosso. More than 50 people died on the way there. Once there, we were told that Bosso had been attacked so we needed to move, either to Diffa or Nguigmi. Once we arrived on this site for internally displaced people in Diffa, IOM gave us non-food item kits and emergency shelter. We decided that we needed a committee to manage the aid received from all of the different NGOs. It has now been a more than a year since I was selected by the local population as the secretary general for the sites management. The site has changed a lot since we first arrived. At first, there were 1,400 families living here and now we are more than 2,500. Its a growing organism. We have received a lot of help in terms of training and education, but a lot of people still dont have the means to feed their families. It has been a big challenge for people to find jobs since there arent enough work opportunities for everyone. We have schools and mosques, but we need jobs and land for this to last. Some people look for wood to sell while others find small jobs in town. Food and medicine is a priority for the community. I used to be farmer, but I cant find any land to work here. I was sleeping when you arrived [to talk to me] and this is what I will go back to doing when you leave. It can be frustrating at times, but I am not stepping foot out of this site until the security situation improves back home. I have seen with my own eyes what Boko Haram is capable of. Its not easy to fix what they have destroyed.

746	Omar Enrique Nizama Peña	Peru	México	L	L	close	6163	8326	E	im	male	"My name is Omar Nizama Peña. I was born in the Amotape district, in Paita, province of the Piura department, northern Peru. I spent a few years of my childhood with my grandparents. Years later, I moved with my parents to Talara, where I grew up, studied and worked on television channels. I graduated as a computer technician and had the opportunity to work as a photographer, as it is one of my passions. In 2011, love came to me. I met who will later become my wife through friends we had in common on Facebook. Her name is Ana. We were friends for a long time and we had a long-distance relationship. This is how, in 2014, I came to Mexico to consolidate the relationship; my wife is Mexican. The following year we got married. Migrating and starting in Mexico was not easy for me. The first day, when I opened my eyes, I realized that I was no longer in my country and, although I was happy to be with my girlfriend, I felt that something was missing. I really missed my little sister, who is the only woman of 8 brothers. She was one year old when I migrated and in each girl I seemed to see her, but I understood that it was a process. The days passed getting to know Mexico and looking for a job. I started washing dishes in a restaurant, where I learned a lot and met very good people, including Sara and Paco who helped me get ahead. Seeing my good performance, they made me cook in their restaurant and after a while I became a kitchen manager. They always said that Peruvians are very hard workers. The following year, I worked at a company as a graphic designer and then, in 2017, I was able to enter a company as a systems technician, position in which I continue until today. I also dedicate myself to photography on weekends and I hope to continue learning until I have my own business. Over the years I learned to adapt to this beautiful country, which welcomed me and to which I am very grateful, as I am also with my wife who has always helped me. In the future, we hope to have our own business so that we can help our families and travel to other countries. Two years ago, I returned to Peru with Ana after a long time and it was a very exciting to reunite with my family. Endless hugs and tears of emotion. I had the opportunity to visit Cusco with my wife. She fell in love with the place and so did I, since it was also the first time I visited such a beautiful place. I miss my country, my family, my friends and my food. I hope to return soon and hug my loved ones and eat a delicious ceviche. I always listen to the song Contigo Perú that makes me imagine back in my homeland. Despite all the obstacles that we face in another country, Peruvians know how to get ahead. Being a migrant taught me that all of us who are far away represent Peru, its culture, its people, its music and its history. It is up to us to always leave the name of our dear and beautiful country high. Let us never forget our roots."

I was born in Batangas, the Philippines, but moved to Jordan in 1989 after marrying a Jordanian that I met while working in a hospital in Saudi Arabia. After years of taking care of my eight daughters, I decided to join IOM's mobile medical team in 2012, right after the eruption of the crisis in Syria. Now I work as a Tuberculosis (TB) nurse at a clinic in Aqaba, Jordan. I give TB patients medical and psychosocial support during their treatment, and my job is very important because it combats the social stigma of diagnosed patients. TB has a negative connotation partially because people associate the medical condition with poverty and bad sanitation. I mainly take care of the technical tasks within the clinic. I conduct medical screenings, collect sputum samples for testing, diagnose TB and refer all presumptive cases to the TB centers of the Jordan Ministry of Health. I make sure to follow up with patients and support their treatment. Most treatments last around six to nine months, so I help patients take their medications correctly in accordance with the World Health Organizations recommended Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) strategy. I remember a Syrian woman back in 2014 whose case I was following in Maan, in southern Jordan. She is a widow and has two daughters. It took us a long time to diagnose her. We even took her to several hospitals to find out what was wrong. Finally, we diagnosed her with extra pulmonary TB. I continually checked her treatment and she recovered successfully. She was resettled to Canada with her daughters through IOM, and we are still in touch.

Most Greeks still dont know who we are or what we are doing.

It took us three days in the desert to get to Libya. We were 25 people in a small pick-up car. One pregnant woman that was with us passed away because the car was driving too fast. Once I got there, life became even harder. I started begging on the streets so I could pay my rent. One day a lady saw me begging and offered me a job. My friend got very sick in Libya. When I had a bit of money, I would buy some medicine for him. He was sick, but not dead. They buried him alive. They said he couldnt have survived anyway. I heard him shout my name from the ground. I ran to him and saw them throwing dirt on top of him. I tried to save him, but they cut me with a knife. My older brother had left for Libya before me. He was in Tripoli already so I didnt get to see him. A friend called me yesterday to tell me my brother died. He sent me a picture too. He was 28. I dont even know what happened to him. I dont have any other siblings; they all passed away. My mom doesnt know he died and if I tell her, she will die too, and I will lose everything. How can I go home without him?! I saw so many things in Libya that I cant even begin to explain. I was in prison for one month and two days. Every Friday they would kill five people. They will give you the phone and make you call your family so you would ask them for money in exchange for your freedom. If they accept to send you money, they write down a number and attach it to your toe. Even if you pay, sometimes they dont set you free. They say they will throw you out, but they just kill you instead. They would hang you, sometimes shoot you. I saw it happen five different times. I said I didnt have a mother, a father - no family. I come from a very poor family so I knew we couldnt afford to pay. So they beat me. They managed to call my uncle and he asked me how much he had to pay. I told him to forget about it, to take care of my mom, to buy medicine and not to pay. Every day they would say: Ousmane, its your turn next Friday. And then one Friday they finally called my name. It was either me or someone I knew. I was one of the youngest in prison so the other guy said: Kill me instead. He is too young to die. When you go to Gambia, go to my village and tell my family I am dead. I never thought I would make it out alive. I was supposed to die there. Many people dont even know I am alive. A lot of people cry in prison. I didnt cry once. If you want to pray, they whip you a hundred times. I prayed five times per day. I regret going to Libya. I have never felt so alone. I just want to go back and start my job again. I wouldnt advise anyone to take this route. I dont have a family; I dont have anything now."
750	Oussama	Tunisia	United States	A	N	far	3318	63123	H	im	male	I started swimming at a young age. As with any parents living on the coast in Tunisia, mine wanted my two older brothers and I to learn how to swim. We were all competitive, and started formally competing right away, we just got hooked. By the age of 15, I was beating all the older competitors and becoming the fastest swimmer in my country. Every move has been fundamental to my success, moving to France was great because it led to huge results. I think Im a skilled swimmer, would I say that if I had stayed in my home country I wouldve won three Olympic medals? Probably not. Swimming has always been my passion. I would love to stay involved on a national level in Tunisia or on an international level with different governing bodies. I would put myself in a position that will be instrumental to the country—I have so many ideas to work with the younger generation. I hope I can become an example for today's generation of aspiring athletes who are dreaming at a very young age. I want parents to say to their children Look at Ous from La Marsa—he did it, you can do it. Going abroad in this day and age is almost a necessity in order to get the skills and technical experience you need, to get that experience and soak it all in. One day youll return and develop whats back home. Its not easy, as with any other process.
751	Owen	Ireland	Belgium	E	E	close	86251	45028	E	im	male	"I have been living in Brussels, for the last year and a half, where I work as a consultant. The thing I miss most about Ireland is the sense of familiarity and comfort, because when you are doing the same thing for your whole adult life, things become quite normal and you have a set comfort zone and you have an idea about whats going to happen in your life. I lost my support structure when I moved, I didnt know anyone, I was starting a new job and I wasnt used to the culture. The sense that everything was new to me was daunting. When I left my house in Brussels I literally had no idea what was going to be at the end of the street because I had a whole new map to familiarize myself with. It was a challenge breaking away from that comfort zone. After some time in Brussels I learnt to appreciate how things were done differently; just because something is done differently in another country it doesnt mean that its done worse. This realisation helped me to evaluate things in Irish culture which are good or bad by seeing how its done differently. When I first arrived in Brussels my command of French was not that good, I never had the confidence to speak French openly and clearly. That was in itself one of the big trials of trying to navigate the most basic day to day things without having the means to properly express myself. For example, I would get on a bus and ask the driver which direction he was going and straight away I would stand out as someone who doesnt know the language and doesnt fit in. The one thing I learned in those situations was that when you make a mistake you never make it again."

At first, it was not so easy to adapt to this country, since everything was new to me: the city, the language, its customs, among other things. Migrating means something very important. It was to meet again, after 12 years, with my father, and to look for a better future that I am achieving with perseverance and a lot of effort. I currently work as a manager in the warehouse area in a chemical and instruments company for hospitals. For 7 years I have been dedicated to the photography of events, such as weddings, concerts, photographic books. For me being a photographer that portrays people is a responsibility, a commitment and an art that I am passionate about. Thanks to photography I have had the opportunity to immortalize great national and international singers. Another of my passions is traveling to various places, always with my inseparable camera. In 2018 I managed to win second place in the photographic contest I am a Peruvian Migrant in the professional category. It was a great emotion for me to see my photographs exhibited in various places in Lima. I still feel nostalgia for having left my country, Peru. I miss riding my bike through its streets, eating a delicious anticucho and playing guitar with my friends from the neighborhood.
753	Pam	United States	Ecuador	N	L	far	63123	5600	L	im	female	I was born in the United States because my parents migrated to the United States in 1984 and I was born in Washington  in 1985. My brother, sister and I were raised in Maryland. Our lifestyle was a mixture of both Ecuadorian and American cultures. Early on, I noticed that my family was very different than the average neighboring family. My parents left Ecuador when they were 21 years old, and moved to the United States As migrants, my parents faced hardships and barriers unimaginable to me. As luck would have it, the administration passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and my parents were able to become legal citizens. We loved Ecuador so much, during the summers we travelled to visit our grandparents. Life was very different in Ecuador. When I was in middle school in Maryland, I experienced some backlash from this bi-cultural life of mine. Certain girls that were Latinas, like me would like to emphasize the fact that I was trying to be white. Thankfully, I had an amazing school counselor who advised me that I did not have to meet any type of criteria to be Latina. I took that advice and realized I did not have to prove to anyone who I was. Prior to graduating my parents sent me on a trip to Europe, which changed my life and I knew I wanted to travel! I bought a one-way ticket to Ecuador with the excuse that I wanted to go to college in Quito. In reality, I just wanted to leave the United States and seek adventure. My parents helped with registering me at the Ecuadorian embassy and within a few weeks, I was a dual citizen of Ecuador and the US. I then enrolled into an Ecuadorian university and started my first semester in college. As many aspects of my life have never gone as planned, I was shocked to learn I was going to have a son at 18. I arrived back to Montgomery County at the beginning of 2004. During those years, I was able to gather more than 12 years of work experience, in corporate America, in non-profit organizations and public schools. Ive also been able to travel to many countries. The day I graduated with my BA from University of Maryland, the look of approval from my parents faces was the moment I had been waiting for my entire adult-life. Today, I am currently living in Quito, Ecuador and I have an Ecuadorian fiancé. Of course, there are moments when I miss the US. I am a humanitarian worker and I provide cultural orientation to help others adapt. I work alongside refugees, providing them training on how their life will be when they are resettled to the United States. This is the most rewarding experience I have ever had. I always wanted to support others by using the knowledge I obtained from being a child of immigrants and growing up in two countries and now I can.

In the beginning being in a new environment was hard, but I was fortunate to havea lot of Irish people in my class, which helped me practice the language and  integrate quite quickly. In my first month  my class went on a four day trip to Galway, in the west of Ireland. That was the first time I met and got to know people outside the classroom. The majority of them would have been Dublin based and had their own groups and friends (so it was good to start to get to know people on a personal level and not just as classmates). In the beginning, the only thing that stood in my way was the language and the lingo, the slang I suppose. The accent wasnt that bad, I didnt have an issue with that. When I moved here, I felt Greek but very integrated. Though, I realized I loved my country when it was the first year that Greece was in a recession and the economy had gone bad. Sometimes people made silly jokes about it… I know they were silly jokes but it actually bothered me. I never thought of myself as a migrant, or an emigrant or and immigrant. I always thought of myself as a young professional who had a dream to move abroad to pursue his career and experience the world. This is what Im doing.
755	Patrick	Nigeria	Niger	A	A	close	2085	568	E	im	male	We were on our way to Libya in a group of 82 people, in three different cars. The driver stopped in the middle of the desert saying he needed to change vehicles, but that he would come back. We spent the following 10 days in the desert. The next day, the first person died. We saw from distance how the drivers were caught by the military as they were coming our way. We were hiding the whole time. We didnt realize at that point that they were looking to rescue us – or that we needed to be rescued in the first place. People started fainting and eventually dying. Two children aged seven and five died, and then their mother did too. Some drank their urine, hoping they would feel better, but it only made them sicker. They were coughing a lot and died holding their stomachs. We made 24 holes in the sand to bury the dead, and put stones all around them. One car stopped at some point and offered to take us to Libya in exchange for money. 26 migrants jumped into the car and left. We havent heard anything from them: maybe they are in prison, maybe they are dead — who knows. I left with two friends, one of them I had to bury in the desert, the other one I assume is dead. After a week in the desert, I couldnt go on anymore so I told my group to leave me there. I was completely alone for the next three days. I fainted several times each day, and used to crawl on my knees during the night when it was less hot, in hopes of finding the rescue team or at least the road. After they found 23 survivors, they also found me somewhere further away between a pile of corpses. They thought I was dead and so did I. A soldier saw my hand moving so they poured water all over me. I opened my eyes for one second and then lost consciousness. Next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital. Since Ive been at IOMs transit centre in Dirkou, Ive had enough time to reflect. I am so grateful to be alive. The whole time I was crawling in the desert, I kept thinking about my baby and my wife - they are all I have in this world. I have come to realize that I had a good life before I left, so I can live just fine without Italy.

I do miss many things from my country though: my family, the comfort of living, and the freedom. I think I can bring a new image of the Nigerian community to Libya. Not everyone is the same; there is the bad and there is the good. In the future I would like to create equality between rich and poor, and between tribes present in the Nigerian community. I would like to tell my Nigerian people to focus on what we can do for our country and what Nigeria can do for us. I would tell Nigerians to teach their grandchildren to do good."

It is a bit difficult because some people have prejudices against foreigners, and about me not having any experience in the country. They think that I am not really qualified or that I dont understand their culture. But it is not true! I live here and I am very adaptable as I lived in 5 countries (USA, Germany, Canada, Brazil and UK) I do understand cultures, and multicultural contexts but it is true that it can still be very difficult. Sometimes, I feel homesick. London is a very crowded city, but people seem to be lonely here. On the other hand, London has a very international social life. I am a foreigner but I dont feel much like that. I meet many people from everywhere, and so I learn about new cultures everyday. I want to stay here for a while, to build something, to start my career but I want to go back to my country one day. I want to raise my children closer to my family.

There I finished my last years of high school, improved my French and learned English. I studied Political Science in the University of Ottawa. I survived raw winters but graduated and obtained my bachelors degree in 2016. Then I returned to Lima for a few months and departed in September to the Netherlands, where I studied a masters degree in International Development. I went with the illusion of building a new life in Europe. During the time I studied my masters degree, I did a practice in Belgium in an NGO that advocates for the rights of refugee children of Syria and who are currently in UN camps in Lebanon and Belgium. It was thanks to this experience that I made the decision to write my thesis on Syrian refugees and their integration into European society. I always had the dream of advocating for other people seeing the existing opportunities in the European Union, its culture and its people. As a Peruvian living an ocean away from my country, one always misses family, friends and food. But my desire to continue chasing my dreams motivates me to continue the struggle. Now, I work at the International Labor Organization in Geneva, Switzerland and I work on issues to help migrants around the world. I decided to share my story because, although many times there may be obstacles along the way, perseverance and effort always win. And also because I think this is an example that Peruvians are warriors!
759	Peshang	Greece	Iraq	E	M	far	18117	4146	E	im	male	My family and I left for Greece in search of better opportunities. When my parents decided to return to Iraq, I realized that it would be challenging to find my way on my own in Europe, and I decided to go back shortly after them. Since I had no means to do so, I sought help in organizing my return and planning for my future. It was difficult to start from scratch back in Iraq. At first, I was worried that I would not find a job. But my family and close friends helped me get back on my feet. They lent me money to buy electrical appliances and tools to open a small shop. With this, and with the reintegration grant I received, I was able to start my own business. My community was of great support. I now see myself building my future instead of looking back in regret.
760	Peter	Poland	Germany	E	E	close	15764	45909	E	im	male	I left Poland as a child at the age of four in the summer of 1989. We had permission to visit relatives in Germany, and just didnt return. My parents could not bear living in Poland anymore. They had just realised nothing was progressing. What was about to happen later in 1989, of course, they could not foresee. So my parents, with two little children and two pieces of luggage, went to a foreign country, to start a new life. I am still very grateful to them. Even though the iron curtain fell shortly after, Germany is the better place for me, I could grow up here with way more liberties. To my parents the arrival in Germany was a shock. We are Silesian, so of German descent and in Poland we were always considered the Germans, so thats how my parents saw themselves. But then they came here, and their German was not even good enough to understand the people. Furthermore in Germany we were immediately the Poles. My parents could never really bridge this gap – to be the Poles here and the Germans there, but never to be part of the group. To spare my brother and me from this experience, they stopped speaking Polish immediately, even amongst themselves. So we all learned German straight away, but nowadays I have the Polish vocabulary of a child, unfortunately. I personally considered myself as German very fast, but from the outside I was often labelled differently. Polish people had a very bad standing at that time in Germany and I have received racist taunts by other young people quite often. To me my migration background is something positive. Its an enrichment and simply a part of me. If somebody asks where Im from, I tell them Poland but that I grew up in Germany. Of course, I have a special connection to Poland. It is where my cradle was, period. But its not my home. I cannot identify with the country. To me migrating was the start into a wonderful life full of freedom and opportunities. This freedom is absolutely important to me – and as a German and European I have it, and enjoy it.
761	Peter	United Kingdom	Honduras	E	L	far	40718	2406	L	im	male	"I came to Honduras as a volunteer in a program from the British government, which provides opportunities for young people to live in other countries with a different culture and to conduct social work. I had never lived outside Liverpool, yet I wanted to experience something new in my life, something completely different. I seized this opportunity to learn another language and meet new people, also for personal development. When I agreed to participate in the volunteer program I knew nothing about Honduras. I did some research about the country but much of the information I found expressed a negative situation. However, I was completely open to this new experience. When I arrived at Honduras in 2013, I was accompanied by 11 volunteers. Im the only one left now! Staying for so long was not my original plan. When the volunteer program had ended the NGO offered me a fixed job, this was one of the reasons why I decided to stay. I also did it for my girlfriend, Celia. Without the support of Celia settling in Honduras would not have been so easy. I had to face many obstacles, especially when it came to the language and understanding the idiosyncrasy of the Honduran culture. Sometimes even the simplest things can become complicated, like going to the doctor or the immigration office, or even asking for a taxi. With the support of a local person, everything is much easier as there is someone who explains processes, the meaning of slangs and tells you what is accepted within the culture and what is not. Every day in Honduras is unpredictable, either for a particular situation the country is facing or because of the people around you. The work I did as a volunteer had a positive impact on the communities, or so I like to believe; but in all honesty, the strongest impact has been on me. This experience has allowed me to appreciate the commitment of others to help people in need; especially those who leave behind their country and all that is familiar in order to explore the unknown."
762	Petrus	Armenia	Armenia	I	I	close	4266	4266	E	hc	male	My name is Petrus. I live in Armenia. My wife, our two young children and I travelled to the Netherlands on Schengen visas that cost a lot of money. We paid a few thousand euros per person, which adds up. But after one year in the Netherlands, we decided to go back home to Armenia. We were fortunate to receive generous support to start anew. Initially I was thinking of starting a cow farm. I did a bit of research and decided instead to focus on sheep, as they do much better on our mountainous terrain. My family received a reintegration grant and we had some savings. I invested everything we had in a flock of sheep. I partnered up with another sheep farmer, and we now share the costs for the paddock, fodder and shepherd. Our little flock is in the lambing phase now, and each ewe has one to three lambs. We will sell the young ones in the surrounding villages. It is not easy. Sustainable animal husbandry requires hard work. Lately we are having trouble keeping a growing population of wolves away from our sheep. Sometimes we are lucky and make some extra earnings as the authorities pay us for each wolf we shoot. I plan to sell my lambs on the Iranian market next year. There is high demand for sheep there, but you need to know a business intermediary, which I have not found yet. We will see what happens.
763	Philipa	Canada	Ghana	N	A	far	43560	2206	L	im	female	"Growing up in a liberal, middle-class household in Canada, I was taught that I could do or be anything. My father was black and my mother white—coming from Ghana and Britain respectively, but it was widely accepted to be of mixed-race descent and I never thought twice about it. From an early age, my fathers passion and love for his country planted a seed and fueled my passion to one day discover my African roots. Thats why, in my early 20s I decided to travel to my fathers home country of Ghana to volunteer at a local hospital and connect with this side of my racial identity—or so I thought. As a naïve young adult, I expected that I would quickly identify with Ghanaian culture and way of life, however, I soon learned that my cross-cultural and liberal upbringing set me apart. What I experienced instead were moments of culture shock and extreme feelings of rejection. Twenty-seven years later and Im still in Ghana. It was never my plan to permanently reside in West Africa, but the more I discovered about this beautiful country, the more I came to appreciate and recognize its potential as a developing nation. Despite some of the social challenges I faced as a bi-racial woman, I wanted to use my education and skills in whatever way I could to contribute to Ghanas development. During my volunteer placement in primary healthcare, I saw the gaps that existed in the healthcare industry as potential opportunities. I began by providing simple services that promoted fitness and as things took off, I expanded to include services that promoted health, nutrition and overall well-being. While my business was doing well, it didnt come without its challenges. At times I wondered if it was worth it; if I was really making an impact on peoples lives. But then something small would happen that would reaffirm my path. A stroke victim would thank me for helping him recover; a ballet student would give me the biggest hug after returning from summer break; or a gym member would say to me my wife would have left me if it werent for that conversation we had after yoga class. Nearly thirty years have passed since I first came to Ghana and Im still going strong. Not only am I an entrepreneur—Im a wife, a mother, a philanthropist and most importantly a proud Ghanaian who sees Ghana as home and is committed to ensuring that this country… my country lives up to its potential. Now that I think about it, I realize that regardless of where I chose to settle (whether it was Canada or Ghana), I was going to have to adapt in order to grow as a professional and as an individual. Ive learned that you have to relish in the positive aspects of your migration journey to turn the challenges into triumphs."
764	Phillip	Uganda	Switzerland	A	E	far	846	86919	H	im	male	I was born in Kampala, Uganda and was six years old when my father, who was a researcher and botanist specialising in animal migration at Makerere University, was fatally injured in a light aircraft crash. What with the worsening political situation in Uganda and the prospect of my mother having to bring up three young children on her own she was forced to move us to London and the family home. After the immense skies and savannah of Africa, London was grey, wet and cold. Everybody looked so pale and unhealthy. We had been a family of bronzed adventurers living with a menagerie of animals and we were more accustomed to seeing zebra, giraffe and elephant on safari than London Buses! What made it even harder to fit in was the fact that we were bilingual English and Swahili and our everyday vocabulary was almost entirely in Swahili. Not so easy in 1970's London. How did I start in music? I tried playing my grandpa's violin but it was alien to me! Then I saw a tuba on television and knew straight away that it was my dream instrument. I asked my Mum if I could play that instrument she thought it was called a trombone and when I was presented with this strange, skinny looking beast I refused to play it! A while later, at school, my music teacher came into the classroom holding a tuba and told us that there was a position available in the brass band and did anyone want to have a go. I jumped to my feet saying Me,me!. I was eleven. My love affair with the tuba had started and every lunchtime you could find me practicing like mad in the music room perched on a cushion because the tuba was too big for me! I was a first study tuba player and classical singer at the Royal Academy of Music in London and I became a professional opera singer, singing all over the world. Today you can hear me on stage as a member of the chorus of the Grand Theatre de Genève. I love being a singer, it's my job and I adore it. Being in costume on the stage, singing some of the most extraordinary music ever written with amazing colleagues in such a great opera house is a real privilege. I play the tuba as much as I can principally with L'Harmonie Nautique de Geneve and I have the good fortune to acquire many interesting instruments. I heard that Antoine Marguier was looking for a tuba player for some concerts and I was thrilled to be able to join the orchestra especially for our fabulous tour to Korea where we gave a very poignant, improvised concert of Arirang in the DMZ. As a member of the United Nations Orchestra I have discovered that there is a real joie de vivre in making music at a very high standard and that it is full of marvellous musicians from all over the world. Music is a language without borders or national impediment and if through our concerts we can somehow help to further the humanitarian goals of the UN that would be something very special indeed.
765	Phumzile	South Africa	United States	A	N	far	5094	63123	H	im	female	"Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka is the Executive Director of UN Women and the first female Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa appointed by the former President Thabo Mbeki from 2005 to 2008. She is passionate about serving the youth and women. I am a South African, through and through, and I am temporarily living in New York for work. I keep a very strong relationship with my country and will be going back there. But at the same time, I am a global citizen; I grew up in South Africa in the time of apartheid, so I know the value and importance of international solidarity. I do everything the way we know women do and I pay attention to what is happening in my village, in my township. I am one of these people who send remittances to their country of origin. I consider migration as an empowering process for women and we have plenty of success stories. Being a migrant has to be an opportunity to start afresh and to build a better life. I wouldnt want to see a migrant woman, who has the skills and talents to lead and contribute to a country, get discriminated because of her birth certificate. It is my third International Womens Day as the head of UN women and Im pleased with the important achievements the global community has made. Overall, the Agenda 2030 has positioned women and girls front and center and will bring lasting change. Part of our work, when it comes to working with migrants, is about ensuring that people are able to start again and to get a better life than the life they are running away from, and in some cases to improve themselves to get stronger than they were when they left. I believe that migrant women deserve particular attention as they face two layers of discrimination: besides gender inequality for women, they also face discrimination as migrants. Reaching out to people who are in need is a shared responsibility. If I can be part of giving back to the people of the world then that is something I would like to do as much as I can."
766	Pia	Finland	Estonia	E	E	close	48685	23106	E	im	female	Usually it is said that Estonians and Finns are quite similar, as both nations share a language belonging to the Finno-Ugric language group. Having lived in Estonia for seven years, the difference that most stands out between Estonians and Finns is the way each nation perceives itself. Finns seem to be quite proud of their country and nationality, whereas Estonians quite insecure about the size of their country. My family and I were invited to Estonia by the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (EELK). I have three main areas of responsibility: supporting family work in the local churches, family counselling at the family centre I have founded and advocating for violent-free relationships.  It seems speaking of domestic violence is shameful in Estonia, but it is important to talk about this as it helps to break the unhealthy patterns. Even though I have a Christian worldview, in counselling, professionalism is the guiding principle. Thanks to my Christian background it is definitely easier to understand, respect and dialogue with a person to whom religion is important, whether it is Islam, Buddhism, Christianity or something else. Before coming to Estonia, my family and I were in Jordan, for four years. Since my husband is a physiotherapist, we visited many refugee camps, where he worked with disabled children, teaching them to walk. I worked with children, youth and refugee families, mainly focusing on the emotional and spiritual side. Visiting many families, I have been in castles, palaces, homes where walls are missing and Bedouin tents. In Jordan I founded a family centre, where various activities and camps were offered to the youth and children. I have also written a book about my experiences in the Middle East. Since Middle Eastern cultures are closer to the Europeans through the migration crisis, many have said only now they understand the experiences and cultural differences described in my book. When I first moved to Estonia I was sad I could not use my Arabic language. Yet, now there are more Arabic speakers and I have had chances to either counsel them or translate for them. I enjoy it. I do not worry about the future. For now, I am exactly where I am supposed to be, doing what is needed. I am enjoying my life in Estonia.
767	Pierre	Burkina Faso	Chad	A	A	close	831	679	E	im	male	"Married and father of 6, Pierre, 45, is a stylist, designer and owner of Balmaya Couture, a complex encompassing a sewing shop and a boutique that focuses on African clothing in general , especially from Burkina Faso. For him, this is an opportunity to allow Chadians to get to know the culture with his famous Danfani cloth. From a young age, he was fascinated by the history of Chad but lived in total confusion. On one hand, his father continuously told him Chad and Burkina-Faso are two countries, brothers and friends with their legendary hospitality.On the contrary, his friends shared that Chad is synonymous with desert and war. Curious and having a love for art, in particular fabric, he found the opportunity to visit and discover the country at a craft fair in 2003 where he was invited to do an exhibition, however, the pleasure was short-lived. Upon return to Burkina, following the exhibition, he guarded his aspiration to one day live in Chad. After being invited a second time for a craft fair in 2011, he finally decided to stay in what he now considers his second homeland. Balmaya Couture was launched in the same year, with the support of his Chadian brothers as he calls them. When asked what is the first image that comes to mind when talking about migration, Pierre expressed that he is amazed to see African youngsters crossing the desert and the sea to Europe at their own risk, just because they are looking for a better life. Some survivors arrive safely and discover another reality on the spot, others lose their lives as a result of the extreme travel conditions; he says, happiness is not only in Europe. For Pierre, one cannot live better than at home, and with Balmaya Couture, he has given a second chance to some of his brothers who attempted the adventure to Europe. However, since 2016, turnover has dropped drastically, and some have left for Burkina Faso to return to their families after a few years of work in Chad. Despite this situation, which almost contributed to the closure of the small business that employs nearly 10 people including young Chadians, Burkinabes, and Ivorians, he perseveres. Pierre urges African policymakers to implement youth employment policies so that they can stay home and contribute to Africas development."
768	Pierre	South Africa	Argentina	A	L	far	5094	8476	E	im	male	"I left South Africa on a one-way ticket for Argentina three days before my 25th birthday. I planned to spend 10 weeks in a language course in Buenos Aires and thereafter I had no plan. I am fortunate; I left because I wanted to, not because I had to. It wasn't South Africa that pushed me away but the rest of the world that lured me. I understood my space and myself in South Africa and I wanted to change that. I wanted to be reduced by the unknown; I wanted to take my box with me and have it torn from me. My first impression was that Argentina was built upon interaction, even more so outside of Buenos Aires. Nothing exists unless it is exchanged: insults, dinner, wine, pride, politics, the couch, telephone numbers, travel stories and friendship circles. What I miss most about South Africa is our diversity and our attitude towards it. I've never been to a country that confronts its clash of cultures so openly. Racism exists but if you go to the street rather than the newspapers, you find that most people genuinely want to build a country where everyone can live together peacefully while having their roots respected. It's no small task - it requires both external and internal change. In Argentina, I was made to change. I was stripped of everything that gave me confidence: my job, my language, my humour, my friends and my comfort. I had to build new tools, become more open and take larger risks. My first paid job after graduating with a Master's Degree in Economics was selling mass-produced, ornamental jewellery to passing tourists in a town of 800 residents whose jobs had closed on them. I only had that job because, when faced with being broke or going home, I stayed and a new friend reached out to me. He gave me a mattress, four square-metres of the thirty that were free in his house, sat me at the dinner table with his wife and kids and gave me a stall next to his on the road. The three months spent there with no Internet, career prospects, access to cities, social circles or my own transport taught me a lot about culture and people. It taught me that culture and people are all you need. You can adapt to anything if the human connection is strong, loving and healthy. Without realising it at the time, that experience defined my mission. True human connection breaks down walls. It diffuses prejudice, violence, ego, protectionism, greed, ignorance and hate, but true human connection requires vulnerability and exposure; a gift that many only receive when they migrate. My mission then is to encourage migration: to encourage the movement of minds and attitudes, of hearts and ideas and to allow people to understand lives they do not have. Being a migrant humbled me into being open to others. Through my writing and filmmaking, my mission is to pass this gift on to others even if they are not able to physically cross their borders. Only by migrating from our ignorance can we truly fight prejudice. Home for me is where they understand me. Home for now is Argentina."
769	PJ	Liberia	Sierra Leone	A	A	close	491	475	E	im	male	"During the conflict in Sierra Leone and Liberia my family moved seven times, 5 of those times we had to leave everything behind. I was born in Liberia to a Liberian mother and Sierra Leonean father. War broke out in 1990 when I was 4, forcing us to flee as a family. At the time, my father was in the UK. We escaped on foot to Sierra Leone, having encounters with rebel soldiers along the way. When my feet got tired and swollen, my mother would encourage me by saying, 'We are going to meet your father.' After being separated for over six months, we were finally reunited with him in his home country. Sierra Leone was yet to experience the conflict, and many were ignorant of our circumstances. Some people made insensitive comments, or asked questions like, 'Do the rebels in Liberia have tails?' Shortly after, the war reached Sierra Leone too. In 1992, I experienced my first coup détat. When it happened again in 1997, we were forced to escape to Guinea where we lived as refugees for a year. I was 11 years old. The trip to Guinea was one of the hardest. By the time, we had an even bigger family as we had started taking kids affected by the conflict. We had to flee from Guinea in small batches, and had to pay bribes at every checkpoint to get through. We ran out of money; my mother had to sell property on the way for us to get by. But once we arrived in Guinea, we were met with great generosity and kindness. We moved back to Sierra Leone in 1998 after the overthrow of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, and continued to build a home for ex-child soldiers or those otherwise affected by the civil war. My parents and I had the conviction to help rebuild Sierra Leone. I came to the UK immediately after losing my father to cancer in 2006. Embraced by a family we developed a close relationship with, I moved here to pursue a leadership training course with LifeLine Network International, and thereafter, university. Initially, I was overwhelmed by the abundance of what was available to people: health care, education, welfare, and even grocery delivery services. It was also strange that running water and electricity were just taken for granted. The learning style in the UK stretched me beyond what I was used to. Combining my learning from Sierra Leone with what Lifeline Projects UK were doing with young people, we were able to develop the No Limits Programme. We used our mentoring teachings from our work with child soldiers to help young people in the UK see that there are no limits to what they could achieve in spite of their circumstances. I effectively have two home countries. I have family, friends and community engagements in both countries. My experience when we were fleeing from conflict is one that lives with me, especially when I hear of others in that situation today, which is why Ive made it my mission to rebuild Sierra Leone.

My father was born in Kenya and my mother in India. My father moved to India when he was a few years old, and in the 1970s he migrated with his family to the UK. My mother went around the same time. They didn´t speak English when they arrived, didn´t go to university, they married and had kids young. My brother and I have higher university degrees, have both lived and studied in various countries, and speak multiple languages. I grew up celebrating Christmas and Diwali with equal enthusiasm. I came to Ecuador to learn Spanish and look for work in development. I´ve been here for 2 years, and am planning on staying for at least a year more. Ecuador is very progressive; the constitution declares that no-one is illegal. I have never experienced any hostility for being an outsider, quite the contrary; everyone I meet is interested in hearing my story and are always keen to make sure I like Ecuador. Ecuador is the fourth country I´ve lived in, and I´ve travelled to 50 in total. Maybe I would have had this wanderlust had I not come from a migrant background, who knows, but I feel like migrating is part of my DNA. Life as a migrant isn´t always fun or easy, even when it´s a choice. It´s lonely when you don´t know anyone and have to make friends, it´s frustrating when you don´t understand how to do simple, everyday tasks like see a doctor, and it´s hard to learn new languages quickly enough to understand the society you´re living in. I am still searching for a place that feels like home. In the meantime, I will keep enjoying the ups and downs of migrant life; exploring new countries, meeting people different to myself, learning new languages, and growing as a person."

We wanted to try and provide a better life for our four children – now we only have three. On our way to Libya, I lost my three-year-old son. The pick-up car they piled us into was very small and overcrowded. There were about 50 people inside with no food or water. People were dying left and right. Once we finally reached Tripoli, they separated the men from the women and put us in connection houses. There were more than 600 women in that house: young, old, all kinds. Some people had recently been stranded at sea so they told us to wait; we waited for three months. I had heard things about Libya, but what I experienced was much worse than what I had imagined. There was so much suffering and death all around. I have never seen anything else like it in my entire life. As a woman in that situation, you want to die. I have seen so many women forced to prostitute. I always made myself look as unattractive as possible: didnt wear any make-up, messed up my hair, and wore ripped clothes. Libyans have no feelings whatsoever; they treat you like an animal. They used to take women to cark parks and garages, rape them 15 at a time and then put them back. Sometimes they tied them up and left them there. Other times they carried them to the bathroom while they were screaming and kicking as we watched helpless from the side. This went on for months. You just pray to God they dont take you too. They are free to use you however they want. What are you going to do or say? Even if you talk back, they wont understand. If you are a black African, and cant speak any Arabic either, they automatically dont like you. You waste your breath trying to argue. Nobody cares. Or worse, they can shoot you or kick you out of the connection house, which you dont want because you still hope to get to Europe. We gave up on that dream and decided to go back, but its very stressful having to do so because we dont know how we will survive. Someone on the route took pity on us and gave us a lift to Niger, and advised us to go to IOM and explain our situation. If I ever see a woman wanting to take this route, I will tell her to kill herself instead."
772	Prospère	Burkina Faso	Algeria	A	A	close	831	3368	E	im	male	For Prospère, the future is full of promise. After returning to Burkina Faso in 2017, he received training in masonry — and is about to receive a professional tool kit so he can put his new skills to work. Three years ago, Prospère was like many other young people in Manga, in Burkina Fasos Centre-South region. Chronically under-employed, Prospère left his country seeking a better life in Algeria in 2015. I was already working as a mason in Burkina, but I could not find work projects. Then, I decided to go to Algeria to work and make money, But not everything turned out as he had hoped. In Algeria, I worked in some places without being paid. Sometimes they [employers] refused to pay on a pretext that the work carried out was not good, even if the supervisors confirmed that the work was properly done, Prospère explained. One morning, Prospère authorities demanded to see his identity documents. He was told he had to leave Algeria. Stranded and desperate in Niger, he contacted IOM. Shortly afterwards, he arrived in Burkina Faso with the support of the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrants Protection and Reintegration. Back in Manga, Prospère shares his experience in Algeria. There were days when I did not eat. Even a loaf of bread was hard to find, he recalled. I believe that here, in Burkina Faso, we young people can succeed. And at least when things do not go well, you have a brother next door to help you. You cannot starve. Today, he is fully committed to his profession. Thanks to the training offered by the Initiative, he has been able to improve his knowledge in several aspects of buildings, a great tool to earn a living. Today, there are people offering me work. So, I know that I will succeed, thanks to God, with hard work and perseverance, he concluded. This motivation has been rewarded. Prospère and the 40 other trained returnees participated in the construction of the Cité du 11 décembre 2018 condominium project in Manga. After this project, I know that I will be able to find new projects more easily, he says. More stable financially, he is especially happy to participate in the development of his region. This masonry training undertaken by Prospère and other returning migrants was provided by the Cercle dOrientation et de Formation Emergency Consult (COFEC) under the Joint Initiative. Today more than 80% of certified learners have already found jobs.
773	Puja	Afghanistan	Germany	I	E	far	508	45909	H	im	female	We fled from the civil war in Afghanistan when I was three years old. At that time we could not stay there, but even before it was difficult, since as Sikhs we were a minority in Kabul. With the Taliban-regime it became impossible for us to live there. I dont remember our escape since I was too young, but I cannot forget our early days in Germany. For two years, we had to move from shelter to shelter, until we were finally allowed to live in our own flat. We had very nice neighbours there. They helped us out – for example by accompanying my parents to buy furniture. Of course we children learned the language faster than our parents. Therefore we had to help them a lot – for example in dealing with the authorities. Today it is an advantage for me, I can cope with the bureaucracy pretty well and am supporting refugees with that. The time here as a refugee has not been easy. There was always that insecurity of will we be able to stay, how long can we stay and where? Our family is scattered throughout Europe, and before we had citizenship, we were not allowed to leave our residency-district so we could not see them. Now however, we have citizenship and I am happy to have family to visit all over Europe. There was always a certain pressure. My parents had great difficulties finding work, but had to prove to the state that they could provide for us, that they were getting integrated. Therefore they worked a lot of hours, for very little money. Germany luckily introduced a minimum wage, so these things dont happen anymore. Even for us children there was the pressure to succeed, good grades in school were important. I was shocked when I even had to show my school report to the aliens department to prove my special success in integration. My parents speak Punjabi to us, not Dari, because we are Sikh. Therefore I am not the Afghan woman people imagine. There is often rejection, but also a somewhat weird curiosity. My classmates and their parents often wanted to visit us. My parents welcomed everyone, but I think our visitors were slightly disappointed. We werent exotic enough. Once a classmate brought a flyer about Afghanistan. Her mum told her to ask me, whether we were wearing burkas at home. I had no clue what a burka was and asked my mother. She explained the situation of women in Afghanistan and that it was one of the reasons to leave the country. Id like to call myself a cosmopolitan. I dont really agree with the concept of a homeland, I think it is too stiff. My family has not been tied to a place for generations – so in that logic, we would be homeless. The urge to categorise people is very problematic, at least since it can lead to rejection. But I think one should simply let people be the way they are.
774	Qaiser	Pakistan	Kuwait	I	M	far	1167	24809	H	im	male	"I am originally from Sargodha, Pakistan. In 2006 right after I graduated from university, I was recruited by an American company called KBR. The company's deployment area was Middle East having Kuwait as my base. I will never forget the day I landed at Kuwait International Airport to find a company representative waiting for me, holding a board with my name on it. It felt like I was entering a whole new world, in which some people knew my name but no one knew me personally. I had packed my 20 years of life in two pieces of luggage, headed towards my new station at a camp in Arifjan. Before coming to Kuwait, I had read about the rich culture and amazing traditions of the Arabs. But when I was deployed I came to learn that I would work and live inside the camp, and have very limited interactions with the locals and restricted movement. I was in Kuwait, but not in Kuwait. Working with US and other collation forces from different countries in my original role was a great experience, which not only broadened my vision of the world but also introduced me to the scope of international work. In 2014, I joined the United Nations and finally I was free to move elsewhere in Kuwait; I find it to be a very rich, historical, and multi-cultural country. I love the traditional food and I never miss the camel racing in Kabd. The decision to migrate helped me in develop my career, as well as giving me an opportunity to learn about different cultures."

It is the place where the uprising that would lead to Syrias civil war erupted in 2011. Five years on, Raaffat, a cook by profession, was attending the cultural orientation session at IOM Greece headquarters in Athens, in the context of the EU Relocation Programme. Together with his wife, 21-year-old Ayat; their two children Bisam (4) and Mohamad (2); as well as 13-year old Mohamad, Ayams relative; they planned to travel to Germany. His younger brother was already there, waiting for them. We arrived on the island of Lesbos on the 19th of March 2016, just one day before the implementation of the EU-Turkey agreement, Raaffat explained. At first, we were mistakenly registered as having arrived on the 23rd, so that would mean that we wouldnt be eligible for relocation. Thankfully, the mix-up was quickly resolved and in a matter of days we got into the relocation programme and an apartment in Athens. During the whole process, IOM staff have been very supportive and helpful. The pace of the procedure was good, we finished with our medical tests very fast, he continued. We are looking forward to a new beginning in Germany. We will be safe, far from the bombs and the bullets of our country. All I want is to protect my children, this is why we left. To save them from war and to offer them the chance to be educated, to have a chance in life."
776	Radja Nainggolan	Belgium	Italy	E	E	close	45028	31238	E	im	male	Radja Nainggolan is the son of a Belgian mother and Indonesian father. While growing up in one of the more disadvantaged neighbourhoods of Antwerp, he was able to hone his football skills to become a professional player. He currently plays for Italian side AS Roma. Nainggolan became an ambassador of the sports and social cohesion project City Pirates Antwerp in 2016. City Pirates is an Antwerp football team active in various neighborhoods of the city. Regardless of age, ability, gender, race, religious conviction or background, the players form a close community. City Pirates is not just about football: the club wants to draw attention to its social role in helping young people feel at home in the city and contribute to Antwerp society. Nainggolan regularly makes surprise visits to the youth training grounds, bringing along other players of the Belgian national team who grew up in Antwerp such as Mousa Dembélé, so as to give more exposure to the project. City Pirates now has over 1,000 youth members, a large share of whom have a migration background, and the club works toward social integration through education, closely involving parents and linking up with social services. Three social workers involved with the City Pirates come into contact with a large number of young people who often grow up in relative poverty. When problems arise among the young players (late payment of membership fees, worn-out clothing, behavioral issues, bad grades at school) the social workers proactively go on home and/or school visits. The children can also do their schoolwork at the club, with support being provided in collaboration with the schools the young players attend. Parents and some of the older club members are offered support to find jobs through partnerships with employment agencies. The relationship of trust built between players, parents and the club, make it easy for certain matters to be dicussed. If necessary, families are referred to other local youth welfare organizations that are part of the City Pirates network. The club then makes a point of accompanying the family to seek out positive incentives for the young players.
777	Radu	Romania	France	E	E	close	12929	38959	E	im	male	I had always lived in a Francophile environment: my father used to read Le Monde to us, and we had copies of Paris Match, Jour de France and Pif le chien at home. My dad would bring us postcards showing the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Lido or French cafés. We knew that France symbolized joy of life, freedom and Human Rights. To us, France was some kind of paradise, with its beautiful, free and modern women. Some kind of carelessness and lightness. At that time, Romania was ruled by a dictatorship. I wanted to make theatre and had brought together an underground company. But I knew I was in danger if I continued to write under this regime, so I had to leave. The remaining question was where to and how. Whenever I talked to my family about this, France always appeared as an obvious choice. I arrived in Paris on 4 December 1980. I still remember all the Christmas decorations I saw on the way out from the airport. So much colour, so many lights! It felt almost indecent to me. I came from a city, Bucharest, where the lights were turned off every night, where the streets were ruined.  What kind of world is that? » I kept asking myself: on one hand, Romania, and on the other, a country so beautiful, too rich. But this uncomfortable feeling faded as soon as I understood that I would be able to say whatever I felt like saying, without having to be scared. What is tricky when you are caught between two extremes is that the more you struggle, the more you expect something magical! I was just arriving from Romania, studying in a post-May 68 cinema school where the students did not want to comply and follow the teachers lead. As I wanted to learn and made it clear, some of the students would make fun of me and say: if you disagree, go back home!. In a sense, I dont hold a grudge. They didnt know what I had been through, how petrified I was in my head. On the other hand, I felt so humiliated that I decided to show them that I would speak like them, write like them, be like them. I so desperately wanted to resemble them, so that they would stop pointing at me.  It is only at a later stage that I understood that it was better being different. Feeling free made me feel like a Parisian very quickly. Some people are born with such a precious gift, and yet they dont even realize it. Others have to fight to obtain that gift, and they will recall it for the rest of their life. This gift is freedom, the beauty of Paris. In my eyes, Paris is the most beautiful city in the world. And being a Parisian means being able to enjoy everything the city has to offer: its culture, history, food, diversity, architecture… It means being able to wander around wherever I want. It means being informed in a democratic way about anything I want. When I am sitting at café terrace I can feel that, for the time being, I am in a free country, and this calms me down. I am not afraid in Paris. France is my home. But my first country, is my kids. I dont forget my Romanian background: it is reflected in my way of being, of thinking. I do not forget my Jewishness neither. Paris helps me combine all of these identities. Of course, all these differences are not always accepted. Sometimes, I feel that some people would like to pigeonhole me, and this can be tough. My filmmaking is not really French and yet I am French. But it is not Romanian either. I have the feeling that we have a hard time recognizing that France is strong and beautiful thanks to its diversity, and that some people, by coming here, try to bring a different tint to the country, and maybe, to build on its heritage. France has Human Rights and democracy in its genes, even if it has known some pretty dark times in its history. France has beautiful values in its heritage and we should be proud helping others to integrate these values and make them their own. I was lucky to be helped, to be welcomed when I came here. Welcoming doesnt only mean opening the door, it also means accompanying. It means being open to the Other. Hospitality is also a dialogue. To fight racism, we need to make sure that people meet each other and talk to each other. We also need to be careful to what we say, to watch out for terms or words which can be excluding. For instance, people never say, when speaking about my children who have a foreign last name, that they are of immigrant background. Is this because one cant actually see it? It almost feels as if there were the French people and the almost French. As if some people were the actual landlords of the French house, while others are tenants who are not supposed to remain here as their lease seems to be renewable. It is not too late. But this takes a lot of pedagogy. We need to teach the youth. Lets praise difference.

They met in Lisbon in 2014 while studying under the Erasmus European Program. Destiny brought them back to Lisbon one year later, where they have continued to be friends. They described their experiences for i am a migrant. Alice: I discovered Fado when I was 15 years old and I immediately fell in love with the sound of the Portuguese language. That is why I chose to study Portuguese and English at school and to explore Lisbon. When I finished my Erasmus year, I went to work in Dublin as a waitress and came back to Portugal afterwards. Rafa: I had planned to go study abroad and Lisbon was not my first choice, but it turned out to be one of the best surprises of my life! Alice and I enjoyed Lisbon so much during that exchange year that we did everything we could to come back to Portugal as soon as we finished our Bachelor degrees in our countries of origin; now we are both doing our Masters degrees here. We also teach Spanish and Italian, and nowadays we even teach Portuguese to other Italians and Spaniards here! I learned a lot in Lisbon and I found the freedom to be myself. I love the diversity, the way different religions and nationalities coexist and the adaptability of the Portuguese population. I made friends for life and I received lots of love here. If I had to describe Lisbon to someone else, I would say that it is a marvelous city! Alice: I would describe the light! It is magical. Lisbon enters the heart and doesn't come out. I have found a unique atmosphere here. All that I have experienced here has changed me as a person; I got to know myself better and the city rejuvenates me. Through our time here we have gone beyond Lisbon; we already travelled across Braga, Porto, Coimbra, Covilhã, Alentejo, Algarve, Açores and Madeira. We met many people who are still in our lives. Every time that we introduce ourselves we say that we are Spanish and Italian-Spanish but with a hint of Portuguese; we are migrants, but we feel a bit Portuguese too. We miss our families and saying goodbye is always difficult, but we also feel torn; when we go back to our countries we feel at home, but we miss Lisbon too! Rafa: This experience has shown me that all of us have something to gain from migration. Diversity is enriching. In the future I want to work in the migration sector, and fight for the rights of the LGBTQ community, in a European Union Institution. I believe that we can change mentalities, behaviors and the system with small gestures and actions. Alice: Even though I love Portugal, I still do not know whether I will stay here or not. I want to specialize in North-American literature, do research and teach. Maybe I will migrate to the United States of America next."
779	Rafael	El Salvador	Italy	L	E	far	3799	31238	H	im	male	I left El Salvador when I was just a child. There was a civil war at the end of the 1980s, and many relatives and friends of mine were moving to the US, Australia or Italy. My family and I decided to move to Honduras instead, hoping to go back once the conflict ended. After I finished high school I decided to go back to El Salvador to start university. Even though it is my home country, it felt like I was in a foreign country. Luckily, Salvadorians are really warm and I settled into my new life quickly. Later on, I started to look for masters degree opportunities abroad as I was eager to discover new realities. I found a program that would allow me to do so and excitingly for me, the first part would be in France and the second, in Italy. I invested all my savings in this opportunity. When I look back at this experience, I can say that France and Italy, which I thought had very similar cultures, are actually extremely different. As a foreigner, it took quite some time for French locals to trust me and get to know me whereas people in Milan are hospitable, the city is well-organized, the level of education is high and of course it is a country rich in culture. Milan is a city that has opened many doors for me. However, I still struggle to get used to the weather, which in the summer was unbearably hot, higher than the temperatures I knew in El Salvador!

This has been one of the most important decisions of my life because, beyond academic accomplishments, it marked the beginning of remarkable growth as a human being. I had the opportunity of studying in Finland in 2016, where I met many people that, just like me, decided to leave their home in search of new opportunities and experiences. Their life stories, joys, and illusions kept me from the cold in more than one occasion. I recently moved to Copenhagen, Denmark to work. The process of leaving behind the bubble of college life to establish myself in a new city has been the most challenging experience of my life. Even easy tasks like signing up for the gym are difficult when you dont understand the language or the culture. I am lucky enough to be a migrant by choice. I have not had to flee from war, authoritarian governments or poverty like some of my friends. Nevertheless, this privilege does not stop me from missing my family, friends, culture, and language. Even though I miss many things, I see the future with optimism and I live my present with deep gratitude.
781	Rafat	Syrian Arab Republic	Portugal	M	E	far	890	22413	H	im	male	I was born and lived for most of my life in Damascus, Syria. I left with my family when the war broke out. We lived in Cairo, Egypt, for three years until we were relocated to Portugal in 2015. This was the second time that we started again from scratch and this new beginning was more difficult because of the language and the cultural differences. Cristiano Ronaldo, Nani, Sporting Lisbon, Benfica and FC Porto were all I knew from Portugal. I really enjoy football and I've already gone to the Sporting stadium twice to watch the football matches. I also like pastéis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts). I eat one every weekend. My first year in Lisbon was horrible. I felt isolated because I did not understand the language. Life only became easier when I began to understand and express myself in Portuguese. It was also complicated to remain live a job for so long, not only because of the money, but also socially, as I did not know many people. Support from the Pão-a-pão Association – which resulted in the opening of the Mezze restaurant – was essential to our reintegration. The most beautiful day I have had in Lisbon so far was the day they opened Mezze – a restaurant which serves Syrian food and only employs refugees. This restaurant has given me motivation. At the beginning I was only waiting tables, but now I have more responsibilities because I am the only one who speaks Portuguese. Despite being in Portugal for almost two years, I am still not used to some of the religious and cultural differences. According to my Muslim upbringing, women and men do not greet with kisses on the cheek. When this happens I always get nervous and step back, for fear of being misunderstood by other people. For now I intend to stay in Portugal. I never wanted to go to another European or Arab country. I have been often asked about potentially going back to Syria once the war is over. Even though it is my country, we have lost everything: the house, the restaurant we had there, our friends, our family… It would be a completely new beginning in a post-war country. Every day I think about our neighborhood there, our street, our restaurant, our friends, and my father who died in the war – it seems that everything happened in another life, a life I miss a lot. A migrant or refugee who arrives in Portugal needs to learn to speak Portuguese. There is no other way to understand how life functions in Portugal, because the language is the key to the country. In Syria we say that if you have a tongue, you never get lost. I like Lisbon very much. Here the streets are clean and organized and hte people are nice and welcoming. In spite of everything I still do not feel at home – life has to calm down first.
782	Raheil	Iraq	Iraq	M	M	close	4146	4146	E	hc	female	"I was 11 years old when my parents and I went to the Netherlands, in August 1997. We were asylum seekers; we had no other choice but to leave Iraq. In the beginning it was difficult to live in a new country with a different language, culture, and environment. I missed the sun, my family, friends, and the shops around the corner where I used to buy candies. At my school in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KR-I), it had become a tradition that every new student had to fight against the strongest student at the school so that everyone knew who was the toughest. The first day at my school in the Netherlands, I was prepared for this and I taught myself some defense tactics. At the schoolyard during the break, some of my new classmates came to me and I thought: Okay, they have come to fight me. I have to control myself and use the defense tactics. But once they came closer, they gave me their hands to shake and asked me to play football with them. I was relieved and could hardly believe that they only wanted to play football. After a while, I started to take the many positive things of the Dutch culture and mix them with the many positive things of my Kurdish culture. My purpose and dream was to finish my studies and return to my own country once it was safe in order to help with the rebuilding process and to build a bridge between KR-I and the Netherlands. I finished my Masters in Real Estate Management and Development at the Eindhoven University of Technology, and in 2013 I came back to Kurdistan with IOMs support. I have since worked for the Dutch Consulate in Erbil as an economic officer, and for SPARK, a Dutch international NGO, as the country representative in Kurdistan. At this moment I am working on different projects for the local Kurds and the returned Kurds from Europe who want set up their business in Kurdistan. I also work with Syrian refugees who want to enroll at the Kurdish universities and with the Iraqi displaced persons in Erbil to offer them a short vocational course and to start their own business. My hope is that these students can do the same thing as I did and eventually return to their own country to help with rebuilding and reconstruction."

Dad was part of the movement against Saddam Hussein. Since I was little, we would always meet ‎people, and I got to meet the King of Jordan. Later on, when the Foreign Minister of Iraq threatened to cut the oil pipeline if Jordan continues to support the movement, my dad decided to move us to Europe. Rahis family moved to Belgium, with his dads caution that they would have to start from zero. No luxury ‎anymore, no driver, and less comfort. When we were getting ready to go to Europe, we really thought my Dad was with a mob. Everything was so secretive. We thought we were going to Disneyland. I was six years old when we moved to Belgium. Back then, it was rare to find Iraqis in Belgium. We were mistaken to be Turkish or Moroccan. We were treated differently, but we got used to it. We were given so many opportunities here that Belgium has become our second home, and I want to give back to this country. I work as a professional Arabic interpreter for the Belgian government and my job is a part of who I am. Its the best way for me to help Belgium, and to help my Iraqi brothers and sisters as well. Rahi has not forgotten his roots. I came back to Iraq in 2003. It was somehow different from how it was before. Iraq is my home as well – where my dad was born, and where my mom and dad met. Id like to see a normal Iraq one day, like the Iraq in the 70s and 80s which my dad always described to me. That would be the Iraq I want to go back to someday.
784	Rachael	United Kingdom	Belgium	E	E	close	40718	45028	E	im	female	My mother is from Mauritius and my father is half Brazilian, half American but I'm originally from the UK. I  now live in Belgium, and Im planning to stay. When Im away from the UK I sometimes miss the people, the food and the ease of navigating a familiar place. I definitely dont miss the weather, but its more or less the same here in Brussels! The biggest challenge that I faced when I moved to Belgium was learning the language, but now Im fluent in French and Dutch. Other than that I think it boils down to the same things I face everywhere: being female and being black, having such big hair – you can see me from a mile away! I think people naturally want to challenge something that they dont see every day. I dont face racism constantly, but I am aware of it – Im aware that its ever present and that people are going to judge me. Hopefully one day itll all be behind us, and we can look back on this period and realize we were being dumb. But until that day, the fight goes on. To combat prejudice at a personal level, its often a question of exposure early on to different people and cultures. We have to make sure to promote the narrative that diversity is a good thing. At the level of the European Parliament, what happens here is just a reflection of what is happening at the national level. Here in Brussels the workforce is very white and very male-dominated, there are issues of accessibility for women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities looking to enter the political sphere. My advice to migrants coming to Europe is to be open, and dont become bitter even though things can be hard. Integrate yourself as quickly as possible: volunteer, take language courses, be active in society, stay busy!

I moved here from London; prior to that I was in New Zealand, where I went at the age of three and lived until my late 20s. I'm originaly from Australia, a country that I left when I was very young. I left the country where I was born because I was young enough to go where my mother went. New Zealand was my home for a long time, but leaving it felt like the right thing to do. There were more economic opportunities elsewhere, plus the move was a chance to travel and get to know another branch of my family. Finding work in Geneva and trying to learn the language were two of the biggest challenges to overcome. I was reluctant to move to Switzerland, although it has grown on me. Visiting Geneva's Old Town and walking along the lakeside as a tourist convinced me I could make a home here. My impressions of the country have become more nuanced, as I spend more time living here, and less time 'just visiting.' I miss of the people of New Zealand, its food, and my life near the sea. But leaving presented opportunities I never would have had at home. As far as that idea of 'home' — it's about people. In that sense, it's something you can carry with you, and build in a new place."
786	Rachel	New Zealand	Ireland	O	E	far	43972	86251	E	im	female	I was born in Auckland, New Zealand. I left my country under a dark cloud. I definitely needed change in my life and things werent really going the way I hoped. I had an argument with my boss in New Zealand and walked out of my place of work into the travel agent across the road and said I want to go somewhere, the girl behind the desk was very helpful and she suggested Dublin. I first came to Ireland in 2012 and I then moved back in 2014 and that was my permanent immigration. I didnt have any connections and it was on my first bus tour that I made some friends and managed to find a job during my first 6 days in Ireland. I went straight into something, I really landed on my feet but ultimately I think it was pure chance. Moving to Ireland was purely about finding myself. When I started to work, I was taking over from a previous counterpart who was an expat like me and was coming close to the end of her one year visa so it helped me get a little bit of inspiration. While I was there I recruited another Kiwi who was travelling around the world. After about four months I met my (now) husband and he supported me pretty much whole heartedly the whole time. I didnt have any connections to anybody here. I was in a very different position, I had a few hundred euros in my pocket and I didnt have any plans. I knew I could get a job but I didnt have one. When I came back here the second time it was very much returning to family: I was returning with my (Irish) partner who had established friends. I guess I brought the rawest version of myself to Ireland and it was very much the making of me, understanding my priorities and developing myself.
787	Raimo	Estonia	Finland	E	E	close	23106	48685	E	im	unisex	I initially came to Finland to experience something new during a gap year after finishing my upper secondary school. I have worked and studied here ever since. Its been six years now. I would say that perhaps it is the innovative opportunities for studying and education in general that brought me here. Coming from Estonia I found the social structure and system here to be quite supportive of my growth. There were many opportunities. Yet, I experienced some difficulty in settling in – particularly to find a place to stay. When I got married to my sweetheart from Estonia, it suddenly became a whole lot easier to find a place, because now we were a family. Experiencing change can have a positive or a negative impact. When life doesnt go as I expect it to, I can either become bitter or embrace the change. As a result of living abroad I think I have grown as a person – expanded my horizons, learnt new languages, acquired new experiences and become more mature socially. In my experience learning the local language and facts about the culture is needed for a good integration. In the case of Estonians in Finland, compared to other immigrants, our language skills are considered too high for basic Finnish language courses. Estonian and Finnish are similar languages, but still quite different. I had to learn Finnish by myself, I managed but it took me quite some time. Also, I find that when people are accepted as they are it encourages them to embrace the culture of the host country. Maybe some dont want to integrate, because they dont feel respected as human beings in the first place? I hope that every person realises that preconceived ideas about another nation have to be personally conquered. We may have them, but it is altogether different when those ideas are actively lived out or people are mistreated because of it. Nobody wants to be mistreated abroad, so it is a wise idea to be friendly to those newcomers instead, in every sense of the word. Perhaps people should ponder for themselves, if he or she wishes to contribute to the betterment of the integration in their society, or spread hostility instead. I personally find that I can only be one or the other.

However in August 92, when the Islamic government took over, my family and I were obliged to leave the country: Hindus had started to be troubled because of their financial business and because of their religion. We started to be seen as Indian migrants and it was common hearing people saying: go back to your country! When I arrived to India though, I was considered an Afghan refugee, so I was treated as a stranger both in Afghanistan and India. Life in Afghanistan was peaceful, but when the civil war started it became too dangerous. I was 22 when we left through Pakistan. We hired a big truck for five families and we all left. The trip took several days. There was dust everywhere, our clothes were dirty, and we never really rested. Although we had visas for passing though Pakistan, we were stopped everywhere and we were obliged to pay….We paid so much money during the trip. When we arrived to India, we took a train to Delhi from Amritsar, in the state of Punjab. We were slightly relieved, and exhausted, we fell asleep. Only when we woke up we realized than the train porter had robbed most of our bags. Unfortunately this was the way that we were welcomed in India! However India was better than other places: it was the only country issuing visas for Afghans. Also Muslim Afghans came to India. I came to India with my parents and my sister. My uncle and my other sister were already here. In a way we were lucky because we already had a place to stay but it was very tough at the beginning. We were four in a small room and my mother was seriously affected by all the changes. Her health rapidly degenerated. For me it was slightly easier. I gradually settled in. I started working and learning computer. I was working and studying at the same time. I then married an Indian man whos a very supportive husband. He encouraged me a lot with my studies. I now have a bachelor and I am very well established: I have a small business; I am a freelance interpreter for refugees coming from Afghanistan, and I work on the radio as a news anchor. I like helping people. I got through a lot of difficult time and I am now happy to be able to give advices and support others. There are always ups and downs and one has to learn to accept them. Sometimes, as I do not look from Afghanistan I happen to hear Afghanis people making jokes about Indians. When that happens I find it funny making them realise that I do understand their language. When I got my Indian citizenship, I decided that I wanted to be happy and I did not want to be uprooted for a second time. I miss everything from Afghanistan: the weather, the fruits, the big houses…almost everything! but I am happy here!"

But those who made it sought revenge and one night they shot dead my father, my younger sister, and my brothers. I fled Afghanistan to go to Norway, but it did not work out. Italy became my only hope. At first, I felt completely alone; those were the worst moments of my life. I expected Rome to be a holy city.

Then I found true friends at the Joel Nafuma Refugee Center in Rome. When I come here I can really feel the humanity and kindness that I was seeking for so long. I studied psychology, but I am also a writer. The first book I ever wrote was about a girl living under the Taliban regime, who would disguise herself as a man to go to university. The story behind that book is based on the life of my neighbor. When the regime came to an end, my book became very popular.  Thanks to my friends in Rome, I am now working as an artisan, and I make jewelry, baskets and other crafts with gems and recycled paper. I still dont know how to fit in here as a refugee. I am doing my best because I dont want to be dependent all the time. We refugees and migrants need more support to stand on our own legs, and then of course we can stand up, walk and go on and fix our lives."

Writing, reading, drawing, everything! says 12-year-old Rama from Syria, who is now staying with her family at the Accommodation Centre for Refugees in Trikala, Greece. Fleeing Aleppo, nine months ago, was a hard decision for her mother, Fatima. I promised my children that they will have a better future and that they will go to school again in Europe she says. Sundos, her 9-year-old daughter, noticeably impatient and excited, jumps in our conversation too: I want to learn many languages! Im so happy to go to school and I want to play with my Greek friends.

792	Ravi	India	Switzerland	I	E	far	1931	86919	H	im	male	I am an Engineer and I currently live in in Geneva, Switzerland. I'm originally from India, but travel has already taken me to many different corners of the world. When I was 21 I moved to Washington state, USA, for my higher education. I was amazed at the grand wide-openness of the United States, happy to get to know the friendly, welcoming people and to experience life in a small town. I came to love the country as time passed and became an American. I married a French girl, and now I am a dual American-French citizen. In today's America we are very divided, especially with a Trump presidency. The USA has traditionally been one of the easiest countries for migrants to integrate into. My only advice to fellow Americans is to continue that great tradition of welcoming immigrants, which has been the source of so much of the country's richness. After 25 years in the US, I was able to bring some of that open-mindedness with me to Switzerland. I miss the cultural connection, family and the hustle-bustle from my years in India, but migration represents a chance to become a global citizen and to enjoy the amazing diversity that makes up our world. I think migrants have real potential to unite people from different religions and cultures. My experience of migration has meant being a productive citizen and doing what I can to engage in the growth and development of the country wherein I live. Interestingly, it has also prompted me to recreate new links with India — I have started working with engineering students in India and I support poor children in India through charities.
793	Raynold	Jamaica	Niger	O	A	far	4665	568	L	im	male	"I was 12 and alone when war broke out in Liberia. I had to run away from campus and call my dad. He sent me money, and I bought myself a one-way ticket to Jamaica. I was young, but I was smart. I then went back to Liberia in 2009 for work. People are always surprised to meet a Jamaican around these parts. My father went from Jamaica to Liberia to work as an engineer, and later moved from Jamaica to New York, but he still has a return citizenship. All of my brothers and sisters live in the US as well. I was the only one that didnt get his US citizenship. I guess it was never something that I truly wanted. Liberia is a nice country, but they dont accept dual citizenship anymore. They told me I had to renounce my Jamaican passport, that I had to choose, and I just couldnt do that. I have worked in many places: Liberia, Uganda, Kenya, and South Sudan. In some places it can be hard. Theres a lot of discrimination, people try to rob you or there are wars going on. Its too risky. I met my current girlfriend in South Sudan. She was a refugee at the time so I took her and her daughter back to their home country in Ivory Coast. In Jamaica people are simple. Business wise its not too good, but if you have enough money, you can start your own business. Still, a lot of Jamaicans end up going abroad for work. I was always in the car business, either driving or selling used cars abroad so I would like to buy a bus when I go back. I miss the beaches and the food in Jamaica; and the people - people love me there. I have a three-year-old boy from a previous relationship. When I found out his mother was doing prostitution, I talked to the police and took him with me. He will have to go to the Ivory Coast for the time being. I wanted to take him with me to Jamaica, but I need time to get my life on track first. Its hard looking for jobs and taking care of him at the same time. Sometimes I would be selling cars and he would have to sit in the car with me; I would be doing business with people and he would have to be there. It hasnt been easy for us."
794	Razan	Syrian Arab Republic	Ireland	M	E	far	890	86251	H	im	female	"Razan stopped watching news reports from Syria temporarily in the run-up to her exams. Hearing tales of the death and destruction in her home country on a daily basis was unbearable, and her studies were slipping. Its like watching your child dying and you cant do anything about it. You feel paralysed. The culture, the heritage, the history, the humanity was being destroyed in front of my eyes and I felt helpless. I had saved for years to come here and study. I worked in Syria and in Kuwait as an English teacher to save the money. The word fail does not exist in my vocabulary. Pay everything and then fail? I literally studied 10-15 hours a day, but at the same time I was watching the news coming from home. I was so upset I decided to stop. I stopped because I couldnt cope. The Syrian journalist was the first member of her family to study a masters degree in Europe. She knows her family are proud of her. However, when she left Syria in 2011, she never imagined there would be no return journey at the end of her studies. I thought the conflict was going to end after a few months. I never thought I would stay in Ireland. I thought, Im going to finish my masters and go back home, because I already had a job waiting for me. Syria is like a piece of a mosaic, it has a mixture of everything: different religions, backgrounds, opinions and lifestyles. But we are all Syrians; we lived in harmony before. It was a real culture shock. I was introduced to Europe through Limerick. But the people were extremely friendly and opened their doors and their hearts to me. People here are curious about you; they ask a lot of questions and are open. Last year their parents visited Ireland for more than a month. It was the first time the family had been together in more than five years. We were all united and it was one of the best moments in my life. They had a great time because it was their first time travelling outside Syria. But they wanted to go back, which I understand. Syria is their home and they are very connected to it. They are older people in their 60s, and its not easy for them to start a new life at this stage, particularly with the language barrier. Razan recognises that she and her siblings are lucky. She says governments worldwide must offer Syrian refugees a safe pathway to asylum in order to avoid the increasingly dangerous routes being taken by men, women and children fleeing their homeland. There are so many ways you can do this: through family reunification, student visas, humanitarian visas or scholarships. There are many ways they can arrive safely and in dignity, but they are not being given that chance. She clings to the hope that the war in Syria will end soon. We have to hold on to the light. Syrians want to go home. They want to go back to their lives, to their businesses, their homes and their families. Everybody must take part in finding a solution."
795	Rehmat	Pakistan	Greece	I	E	far	1167	18117	H	im	female	My name is Rehmat and I was born in Pakistan 45 years ago. I left my home town, Sialkot, due to financial problems. It was very difficult for me to find a new job. My father owned a grocery store. I used to work there, but when he died things became very difficult, so I decided to close our small family business. My journey to Greece was not very easy. I was travelling for almost 62 days and before reaching Greece I stayed in Istanbul for 10 days. I could not find a job there either. Five years ago, I arrived in Greece. My first stop was in the city of Thiva, where I was working as a farm worker. I was living in a warehouse and instead of money I was getting food for my services. I stayed there for nine months before leaving for different cities in Greece. I went to Arta, Patras, Chalkida and Lykovrisi, a small town outside Athens, always looking for a job in the fields. It was eighteen months ago, when I realized something was wrong with my body. My belly got swollen due to a large quantity of liquid. It was really painful and getting access to the Greek National Health system was not very easy. Fortunately a girl friend of mine suggested IOM. I started thinking of returning back to my family in Pakistan, where I have three sisters. I applied for Assisted Voluntary Return and because of my fragile health condition, I was transferred to the open center for migrants registered for AVRR (OCAVRR). IOM and Reception and Identification Service staff proved really helpful. Thanks to all of them, I managed to cope with my severe health issues. I was suffering from mitral valve stenosis, right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Flying back home was not an option and heart surgery was the only solution. I was overwhelmed with fear. I had no faith in me and I was really scared. IOM staff working in OCAVRR facility stepped up and planned the difficult surgery. Fortunately everything went well and now, although I am still weak, I am emotionally stronger and I can fly back home. At the beginning it wont be easy, since I cannot work for a year, but I strongly believe in better job opportunities there. Living in OCAVRR was a once in a lifetime experience. I had my own clean room, delicious food and nice people working for me. My favorite food in Greece is beef burger with potatoes and back home green peas with minced beef. I strongly believe that I am now ready to go back home and restart my new life. There are not enough words to thank everyone in IOM, especially the medical staff of the Open Center. They really saved my life!
796	Reinaldo	Colombia	Colombia	L	L	close	5333	5333	E	hc	male	"In response to the increasingly burning droughts and seeking better living conditions for himself and his family, Reinaldo migrated from Colombia to Venezuela 10 years ago. At first, he found there good employment and study opportunities for his son and his nephew. But some years later Reinaldo took the decision to go back to his ancestral territory where his family, like hundreds of families from the Guajira region, is suffering from the climate change´s harsh consequences that have devastated all their livelihoods. This prolonged drought has left nothing but death in its wake and submission of an entire people that always lived independently, but that request government subsidies nowadays. I remember that my grandmother and my mother had everything they needed, it used to rain every three months in the region, if the middle lands dried, it rained again and our crops produced enough. At any time we had corn, yucca, and all kinds of plants stocks. But today there is no abundance any more, everything depends on money. If there is no money, there is no food.  Also, the children of the family who lived and studied in Venezuela, dream of a better future, away from climate change´s consequences. Despite this hostile environment, Reinaldo claims that even if we suffer because of many issues here such as the drought, it is here where I feel calm. Reinaldo concludes that its purpose is not that communities request government aid: We are willing to sow, we are sowers and shepherds; what we need is water and that is enough for us to defend our people. The solution for everything is water."
797	Rene	Rwanda	Rwanda	A	A	close	798	798	E	hc	male	"I was born in Rwanda in 1984. My mother realized I wouldnt have the same opportunities here as I would elsewhere and feared I would resent her for not giving me a chance to succeed. Rwandese society at that time was not very open to diversity and I was different in many aspects; I didnt feel welcome at school and outside of home the ambience could become hostile. My father was a missionary so he couldnt take care of me either. So at the age of six a Belgian couple adopted me. When that happened I was given another name and a new identity, I was claimed as theirs. That caused psychological issues for me because as a child I didnt know who I was anymore, I already had an identity and it got lost. I already belonged somewhere and suddenly I was in a different continent with a new label on me. I got a new family but I already had a family. I grew up in Belgium, studied and made my life there. In some regards I felt Belgian. I would support the national football team for example, however I could also feel the limitations of being there, not only professionally but also socially. I didnt feel 100% at ease. Belgium was the place where my house was but it never quite felt like home. Since I was six I dreamed about coming back to Rwanda. As I grew up I felt the need to know my mother, my country, my language, my culture, and returning to Rwanda was the only way to do so. I did not know if my mother was alive — I cut all contact with Rwanda when I left. I didnt have a name or a place to look up. I had nothing. I got in contact with my biological father and he managed to find my mother's number, so I called her. She had been expecting that phone call for over 20 years. When I got on the plane that brought me back, that is when it felt real. My hands were shaking and I could hear my heartbeat. From the plane at night, looking down at Kigali city lights was like looking at the universe. The whole feeling was surreal. I was 29 when the opportunity first materialized to go to Rwanda and 30 when I eventually made it back. My mom was waiting for me at the airport with some friends and family. When we were finally reunited it all felt like being in a dream. It had been the most intense period of my life leading up to the trip and in one moment everything came back to me: I could immediately remember the people, the smells, the landscape and the tastes. I wanted to be back and take the time to really reconnect with the country from which I came, not only as a visitor but also as a member of society. I also wanted to contribute - with the knowledge I was able to acquire - to building the country, and to being part of something that would create prosperity.  However, I wasn't under any illusions. I was as eager to learn, as I was to contribute. To get back to being myself, the first thing I wanted to do was to reclaim my name and get my identity card. A piece of paper cannot determine your identity; I had a Belgian passport and didnt always feel Belgian, but when I got the Rwandan ID and passport I knew with all my heart that I was complete. I always considered nations and borders to be artificial delineations. To a certain extent I dont even think they matter, even if we have built an entire world system based on that notion. I do believe in identity and the importance of having a sense of belonging, of feeling connected. This is where the stories of nations make a difference, connecting people to strive for the common good and to thrive together as families, friends, colleagues and neighbours."
798	Rex	Nigeria	Libya	A	A	close	2085	4243	E	im	male	"When Being Informed Is Not Enough to Keep You Home Information is power, runs the popular adage. However, being informed about the risks he would endure along the migration routes was not enough to keep Rex home. I owned a barber shop and I was doing quite well, said the 20-year-old Nigerian. I was aware of the dangers of travelling through the desert to Libya, and at times discouraged people from doing so, and yet, I fell victim of it, he added. Rex paid the sum of NGN 350,000 (USD 970) to a smuggler, popularly referred to as bogar in Nigeria, who promised to take him to Libya in an air-conditioned bus and put him on a ship headed to Italy. I saw the pictures of Europe a friend posted on Instagram. We chatted, and he told me not to be afraid, said the young man. This friend was under my tutelage and I felt that if he could make it, then there is no harm in trying. Rexs adventure was however not what he expected. After his failed attempt at crossing to Italy, Rex was sent to a detention centre. He stayed there for six months, together with other migrants from Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and Mali. I thought about committing suicide while in detention. We did not have enough food and water. We could not shower. It had already been 18 months since Rex last spoke with his family, who assumed he was dead. The day he left home; I had a premonition that something was wrong in my house. For three days, we did not know his whereabouts, said Michel, Rexs father. His mother died a few months after his departure, probably because of the high blood pressure she developed worrying about her missing son, the father added. During one of IOMs visits to the detention centre, Rex indicated that he wanted to go home. Upon return, and after receiving counseling, he was supported by IOM to reopen the barbershop he had closed down before leaving for Europe. IOM helped me stand on my feet again. Today, I encourage youth not to take this journey. Experience is the best teacher, and Im grateful for my lessons, concluded the young man. As part of its awareness raising activities, IOM uses participatory communications involving the communities and returnees to raise awareness about the risks of irregular migration as well and promote social cohesion."
799	Richard	United Kingdom	Switzerland	E	E	close	40718	86919	E	im	male	"I worked as a language assistant in France and a teacher of foreign languages in Hong Kong and the UK for years before I came to Switzerland. I knew the country to a certain extent, as I had worked here as a waiter almost 30 years ago. I even ended up doing an Extended Essay on Swiss German in high school, as I was fascinated by this language. Today, by teaching my native tongue amongst other things, I am very proud to be able to present my home culture to my students and I love sharing anecdotes with them. Living abroad certainly makes you appreciate your home country more. It has not always been easy here, as the people can be polite but reserved. Despite speaking fluent French, it is difficult to approach people. I am still getting used to the rules here after all this time; I miss being able to cross the road in London wherever and whenever without getting a fine! I started playing the piano when I was 8, because my brother was playing it. It was a disaster! Dealing with the right and left hand was dreadful, and I definitely couldn't multi- task. However, when I was 12 my mum wanted me to be able to play 'Stranger on the Shore so… I started the clarinet! And here I am in Geneva, a few decades later, playing at the UN Orchestra. I joined it six years ago and found it intimidating at first, as the level was so high and it was my first time in an orchestra. Nonetheless, I stuck it out and have managed to hold on for dear life and still be counted as one of the members. I love the music so much and also the challenge it represents. I always say that languages come easily to me, and I teach them in an international school, but music doesn't. By being a member of the orchestra I am putting myself in my students' shoes. You are very exposed as a musician and also as a linguist, so for me it is a good exercise in empathy! Sometimes, music can help communicate and sometimes…it does not! When I was in Hong Kong, I played in the school band, and a Chinese employee who had seen me play the clarinet -which she thought was a saxophone- asked me how is your 'sexy fun' going?!'"
800	Richard	Zimbabwe	South Africa	A	A	close	1466	5094	E	im	male	"When I left Zimbabwe in 2004 to look for a job in South Africa things were really challenging economically. I knew I had to do something in order for me to see the success I was dreaming of every day. I migrated because I knew there were greener pastures somewhere out there. I knew there was a lot of opportunities in South Africa. The economy was developed, the infrastructure was nice; it was refreshing to be there. My plan was to get myself a job and continue with my studies but life had other plans for me. I stayed 18 months jobless until I almost gave up. I received a call for a job interview to work at one of the major banks. And I got the job! I worked a few years until I ventured into business. I never looked back and the hustle continues. Being a migrant without a support system, family, relatives or anyone that you know can be very difficult. I was fortunate to have some of my family around. As a migrant, you learn to persevere because you are away from your comfort zone. You dont have a family structure to lean on. You learn to become a little more thick-skinned. You go through challenges and you also become street-smart. You learn that people will make you promises that dont materialize. You become wiser as you get older and you begin to realize that certain things are not good for you. I have spent a bulk of my adulthood as migrant and I learned a few things which Im very grateful for. I believe South Africa is an open country where there is a lot of room for migrants to make it. There are enough opportunities for both South Africans and migrants because ultimately we are all Africans and the borders that separate us are just artificial borders. We should be able to move, work and be productive for the great of the continent and not be nationalistic in one country. My journey has been interesting. My first three years were very difficult. It was tough but I managed to pull through.  Twelve years later I look back and appreciate what I have gone through. I look back and realize I am fortunate to be in my position. I appreciate that home is not that far away. Many migrants are very far from their homes. Being a migrant is not easy, you face a lot of challenges but you learn to persevere."

My research focuses on improving the education system by building understanding about the psychological characteristics of successful teachers. We have been awarded over a million pounds in funding from the European Research Council for our research in the UK and seven other countries. My wife works as an administrator and volunteers as a counsellor one day a week, and my son is a medical student in a UK university. My two young adult daughters are recent university graduates and are trying to gain residency in the UK, but it is an uphill struggle.

To do this I came up with a plan to move 'across the table' to help students access universities around the world. Luckily, it happened quite easily: I was offered a post at a top international school in Hong Kong where I found that I was warmly welcomed, helped every step of the way, and was seen as an asset to the local area. I have loved the multicultural aspect of living in a vibrant environment where everyone has a different background and brings something new to the table and feel I have made a difference to those I work with because of my different national viewpoint. 'Sadly,' because I am white, educated and relatively wealthy, this transition from the UK to Hong​ Kong was easy; it is not always so for those coming from less fortunate backgrounds, but who can possibly say they have less to give than I do? Migration is not just one way, there are many people from developed countries that have benefited from migration, it is time to be fair to all."

A place where all people have equal rights under the law. Creating harmony midst diversity is a fundamental issue of the twenty-first century. While celebrating the unique characteristics of different peoples and cultures, we have to create solidarity on the level of our common humanity, our common life. Without such solidarity, there will be no future for the human race. Diversity should not beget conflict in the world, but richness. I believe this with all my being."
805	Roberto	Italy	Switzerland	E	E	close	31238	86919	E	im	male	I'm an international civil servant, currently working in Geneva. When I was 22, I left Italy for France, where I went because I wanted to study abroad. When I first got to France I noticed that there were a lot of stereotypes about Italians, and I couldn't reconcile these with the ideas I had about myself. There was also a language barrier to overcome. But I kept my head down and made the most of my experience there, which taught me that I would be just fine if ever I decided to travel further. Eventually, my journey brought me to Switzerland. On a basic level, that is all migration is: looking for better or simply different opportunities to develop oneself and follow your path. When I go somewhere, I bring my skills, knowledge and vision of the world. This is what keeps society, and life, interesting. Now that I am on the other side, my message to both those who choose to go and those who welcome them: be open and curious — change is inevitable, whether you seek it out or it comes to you.

I was able to finish my education here: I completed a double degree in Computer Networking and Information Systems, and in 2017 I completed my Masters in Business in Melbourne. I will always have a strong link with Afghanistan, its the country where I was born and that will always keep me connected. Sadly, some of my relatives and friends are still back there living in the middle of a war has been going on there for years. I feel that all we can do is say prayers and hope for a better Afghanistan, so that it becomes a peaceful country and we can visit, live and work there. At least Id like to be able to take my family for holidays but at the moment the situation is dangerous. I really miss my country but I am grateful to call Australia my home; Ive spent half of my life here. When I came here I didnt know a word of English, so I started from scratch. Today I have higher education degrees and own a successful business in Australia. I enjoy contributing to this country in the business field; I import goods from Turkey, Afghanistan and China, and through my business I pay tax and provide employment for people.

Maybe it was a bit of a risk, I dont know…, just moving to a city that I know absolutely nothing about. It was probably quite easy for me landing down in Spain because I had been brought out there and relocated by the company I work for. My first impressions of Barcelona were that its quite an easy city to get comfortable in because its such an international city. I spoke no Spanish before moving to Barcelona and that wasnt much of a hindrance initially, but I then did have the support of my company. Having lived here for nearly 3 years, my Spanish is quite poor for what it is. I have enough to get by, but I am nowhere near fluent and Ill probably never be fluent in Spanish. All my social circles are English speaking. If I was to start all over again, I would definitely try to make a better effort to learn Spanish, maybe get myself a Spanish girlfriend. Of the people I work with, the people who became most integrated are those who have a Spanish partner or Catalan partner. I feel comfortable in Barcelona but I dont feel integrated into Spanish society. I feel on the periphery of Spanish society, your kind of that foreigner or foreigner group, but I dont have any intention to leave in the near future. I dont miss a massive amount in Ireland. I had been living in London for a year before that so I had already got used to living away. Friends and family: you kind of miss that, but Im only living in Spain and its only a two and a half hour flight back, so its not that difficult for me.
811	Rosa	Gambia	Ghana	A	A	close	757	2206	E	im	female	"Rosa Comfort Gomez – Beautician in Brusubi (WCR) People should be able to migrate as a right, but we should take into consideration that there are safer ways to migrate; be it within Africa or in other continents. In 2017, I migrated to Ghana to study cosmetology. Given that both The Gambia and Ghana are member-states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), I was able to reside in Ghana for two and half years and returned back to The Gambia in 2019. The only required documents for my travel by air were my valid passport and yellow fever card. After the 90-day limit, I applied for a residential permit from the immigration authorities and received it within two weeks. Permits should be renewed yearly and cost between USD 100-200 (approximately GMD 5,000-10,000), depending on whether you overstay or not. During my stay in Ghana, I experienced a bit of xenophobia and racism, especially because some of the locals thought I was trying to take their jobs after finishing school. Despite this, the positives of migrating to Ghana outweighed the negative. I had good access to courses which were not available in The Gambia and learned important skills such as cream and perfume making. Since Ive been back, I am working on opening my own salon in Brusubi to offer services such as hair braiding, makeup, pedicure and nails. However, due to the pandemic, the whole process is taking longer than expected, so I'm currently working from home. With my experience, migrating to countries within the ECOWAS sub-region was beneficial because it has many opportunities for Gambians, including education and job alternatives. Its important when traveling to adequately follow all procedures. From my experiences, I ensured that my passport was valid and carried the required documents such as the yellow fever card. I believe that theres nothing that you cant get within Africa. If you go to the backway, most of the time you are working low-skilled jobs and risking your life. I believe people should be able to migrate as a right, but we should take into consideration that there are safer ways to migrate; be it within Africa or in other continents."
812	Rosalie	Guinea-Bissau	Mauritania	A	A	close	668	1702	E	im	female	Born in Guinea Bissau, Rosalie took a journey in search of a better life. At the age of fifteen, she went to Dakar to join her older sister and worked there for two years. In 1988 she went back to her village where she met her husband. Together they decided to migrate to Mauritania. In Bissau there are no jobs. We are a big family so everybody needs to contribute. We chose Mauritania because, among the countries of West Africa, it is the one with more job availability and whose currency weighs more. Less than a month from their arrival in March of 1989, the political turmoil between Senegal and Mauritania started. Her husband went back to Senegal, but she decided to stay. The first few months were not easy for Rosalie. But day by day, with her hard work and perseverance, things became better for her. She currently works as housekeeper for several offices in Mauritania. She has three children, the eldest currently based in Portugal, and the younger ones still studying in a school in Senegal. Now I am happy. Mashallah. I have work, and some money and when I can, I visit my family in Guinea. If one day I earned enough money, I would like to go back to Guinea. Mauritania is only for work and Europe is only for holidays. I prefer to stay in Africa, even if this means having less money. I prefer my country to anything else. To me, migration means discovering things, meeting new people, and getting to know the world. But migration also means suffering. You do not leave your country if you are not suffering from something. When you migrate, you are alone. You are far from your family.  You are on your own. You migrate to find a job, put some money aside, and then go back to your country to buy a house and build up a new life.
813	Rotimi	Nigeria	Estonia	A	E	far	2085	23106	H	im	male	The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. I didnt really want to move out of my country, but at one point, I looked at where I was and thought 'this is not where Im supposed to be, I have to take a step in order to get to where Im going.' Im an Electrical Engineering graduate, but I haven't practiced it because of the unemployment rate at home. After graduating, I went straight into business. After working for a while, I realized that I was in my comfort zone and couldn't see growth. For things to get better, I had to get better.  My sister, who lives in the USA, had been telling me I needed to move and do something more. I always answered 'when its time.' Finally the time came — I contacted her, she linked me up with her husband who was in Estonia doing his Ph.D., and after speaking with him, I decided to come here. In Nigeria, I did a lot of things, but the economic situation made it so difficult to leave. This is my first experience abroad, but Ive not had a negative experience so far in Estonia. Many say they feel discriminated because of their colour, but I haven't felt that. Im always curious to learn from people of different backgrounds. I dont let my ego get in the way. I have found that if you dont go to the Estonians, they keep to themselves. I have started to move towards Estonians. My fellow black men ask why I do this, but I believe it's what you have within that determines who you are, not your colour. Whether short, tall, full-bodied, colourful — its not about your physical appearance, but about who you are as a person and how much you can give of what you have. Where I come from, we share the love but hardly hug each other. Here you have to hug. One of my mentors said if you want to get connected, do more hugging every day. Twenty hugs daily will keep you connected, happy and fulfilled, so Ive learned the attitude of hugging. I believe in the possibility of anything. With God all things are possible. Estonia is developing because they believed in the future. Where Im from some of the leaders dont see beyond themselves. If a country doesnt believe in its youth, there cant be growth. If the youth dont take responsibility to fight for their rights, nothing can happen. So, Im heartbroken when I think of the young generation of Africans, because our older generations will one day pass away. What heritage shall we leave to them? I believe wherever we are, a positive change needs to happen to that environment. Thats why Im here, to learn more, change some of my belief systems and hopefully touch others with my words and purpose. I hope to be a better leader.
814	Roula	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	female	Roula is a 31-year-old hairdresser from Daraa, Syria. Together with her family, shes about to relocate from Greece to Portugal. I was out with my son, Moulham. My husband, Suleiman, and my daughter, Kinana, were at home when the bomb struck. Arriving at my destroyed house, with my loved ones buried underneath the rubble, I nearly lost my mind. Thankfully, the Red Crescent managed to get them out and transport them to a makeshift hospital at the buffer zone between the regime army and the rebels. My daughter had both her legs in plaster for a very long time and my husbands back was badly damaged. I used to be a hairdresser and Suleiman was a chef. When the war started, there were no jobs so Suleiman was working here and there to make ends meet. But we had our house so we didnt plan to leave Daraa, our hometown. After the bombing, we spent another two months there, so that both Suleiman and Kinana could make the journey. It took us one month to get to the Turkish-Syrian border. We walked for 9 hours each night to avoid trouble and I was pregnant and carrying Kinana on my back. In Turkey, it was the first time we ever saw the sea. It was terrifying, as well as the crossing to the island of Chios, on January 2016. After we got registered, we were sent to Ritsona accommodation centre near Athens. A few months later, I gave birth to my baby boy, Mohammad. We got in the Relocation Programme, hoping to settle to Germany. However, God or fate, you name it, decided that Portugal will be our new home. I hope that everything is going to be fine. I dont care about me, I only care about the future of my children. My son Moulham is 9 years old and he has never been to school. He doesnt know how to read or write, its very important for me that all of my children will have access to education. We didnt leave out country because we were poor or hungry but to escape war. All we want is to live a life in dignity. Dignity is the most important thing for a human being. Now that our adventure is drawing to an end, I have so many memories, some bad and some good. A fond one is Greece and its people. You have been so kind and generous to us. Well never forget you.
815	Ruben	Spain	Switzerland	E	E	close	27409	86919	E	im	male	"I arrived to Strasbourg from Spain right after finishing my engineering studies in Madrid. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the Alsace region and the architecture which is so different to the one back home. Yet, what stroke me most, was how people appreciated silence and calm, like here in Switzerland. Of course, being away from home for a while now, I miss the sea and spending a sunny day with my friends or a weekend with my family but Im glad I have music in my life. It fills me with happiness. Anyways I could not do without it as I come from a family of professional musicians. To me, music is the center of my life; I can neither walk, work nor think without music. Listening to music is like vitamin in my life. When I arrived in Geneva, I missed playing music so when I heard of the UN Orchestra, I immediately applied for an audition. Playing here is a reward in life, sharing a passion with so many different people, from different countries and cultures with a same goal is a way to fulfill my days with happiness. Plus, the Orchestra gives me the opportunity to meet new people and bring our music to new countries. I remember once, I had taken my violin to some remote West African areas where needs are greater than just listening to classical music… and I started playing to a child who was crying in the street. The next day, it is more than ten kids who were waiting for me to play again. These moments are unforgettable."
816	Rubens	Democratic Republic of the Congo	Democratic Republic of the Congo	A	A	close	506	506	E	hc	male	I always had the intention to go abroad to study. Like many young Congolese, I was full of ambition. I wanted to go experience another culture, so I decided to try living in a new country where the customs were different to those in my country, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In 2010 I went to study international relations in Brasília, the capital of Brazil. It was the first time in my life I was out of my own country and so far away from my family. In the beginning I was really surprised. The food was so new to me, and how people greeted each other, and even kiss, was totally different from what I see in my own country. It was a new language to learn and hear as well, full of new codes for expressing respect which were so unkown in my culture. After 5 years I returned to the DRC, but my country had totally changed. It took me a while to adjust to this coming back: from the transport system to the flow of people. It's another atmosphere and I am actually re-learning many things. One example that was surprising for me when I came back was how the DRC is a traditional country, where you wont really see people kissing publicly although in Brazil, it was very common. When I first saw that in Brasilia, I thought Oh my god! What is going on?  Eventually I got used to it. I'd like to see this kind of openness in my country one day. What I experienced overseas was a doorway for me. It motivated me to look for other experiences somewhere else. One day I want to work for the United Nations, because it gives people opportunities to make cultural exchanges and discover the world. My ambition is to continue moving and migrating, traveling throughout the world and meeting other cultures, meeting other people. I think this is how we can always enrich ourselves, and have extraordinary experiences.
817	Rufina	Papua New Guinea	Papua New Guinea	I	I	close	2640	2640	E	hc	female	Rufina, a grandmother in her 70s, was forced to leave the Carteret Islands in Papua New Guinea two years ago. After relocating to Buka because of worsening land degradation, she still desires to return home. The area of land available to cultivate in her homeland was shrinking due to the significant rise of sea-level and exacerbated by high population growth. Losing her land presented problems she felt she could only deal with by leaving. Apart from the decline of cultivable land, insufficient access to government services due to poor public infrastructures and the remoteness of her home, was a push factor for Rufina to migrate to Buka. Currently, her source of income largely comes from making various baked goods. With any surplus that she makes, Rufina buys food from the local market to send to her grandchildren back home. I go and do gardening in the Hagogohe village where villagers know me. From my harvests I am also able to send kaukau [sweet potatoes] to feed my grandchildren back home. Rufina was a well-respected leader and member of the Council of Elders (COE) in the Carteret Islands. In Buka, she continues to take on leadership as counsellor and primarily involves herself in youth and womens advocacies and activities. Among her many advocacies, she has called upon the government for a safe, reliable and affordable  transport system to and from the islands. Facilitating the mobility of her people to access government services and livelihood options would provide a favorable adaptation strategy to the people of Carterets. Rufina believes that if the government could address land and housing matters of the resettlement sites, more families from the Carterets could be successfully relocated and establish their livelihood in mainland Buka. In the meantime she is calling for support towards the establishment of a transit house to facilitate the proper resettlement of the environmental migrants. Despite her desire to live in the Carterets in her entire lifetime, Rufina sees the resettlement of herself and of her people as inevitable due to climate change. The island is experiencing unprecedented environmental changes, and the livelihood of future generations is severely threatened.
818	Rup	Bhutan	Australia	I	O	far	3218	55823	H	im	male	"I am from Bhutan, my father was from Bhutan and my grandfather was from Bhutan, but as we belong to the Nepalese-speaking people of Bhutan, we had to leave. We were farmers in Bhutan, but when we arrived in Eastern Nepal as refugees in 1991, we had nothing. We went to the local government for help; they gave us written authorisation to beg. Then the first aid organisations arrived. They provided us with food, blankets, medicine and shelter. There were seven Bhutanese Refugee Camps in Eastern Nepal. The one I lived in was the biggest with a population of 24,000 people. People got educated, lived and died there. My own father passed away there. I was a social worker. After 19 years in the refugee camp, we were given the option of settling in another country. We were advised to go to Australia and the UNHCR helped us attend an interview at the Australian High Commission. They asked many questions and we had to pass a medical examination, but we were granted a visa and in February 2010, with the help of the IOM, we arrived in Launceston, Tasmania. Australia is very different from Nepal. Weve had stress, but weve received help from the locals and organisations and slowly, we are getting more relaxed. Launceston is home now. There are about 2,000 Bhutanese people in Launceston and Hobart, of which most are from the same camp I came from. I provide support as the chairman of the Australian Bhutanese Society of Northern Tasmania. I also work in the wider community as a support worker. I had lived in Nepal for almost 20 years, but I didnt have anything when I left – no job, no money and no citizenship. Everyone said You are a refugee. In Australia, no one says that. I am very proud to be an Australian citizen."
819	Rzn	Syrian Arab Republic	Switzerland	M	E	far	890	86919	H	im	male	I first left Syria for Jordan when I was 26, to get away from the war in my home country. I now live in Geneva, where I work for Nestlé and carry out many volunteer activities. This isn't my first time in the city — I spent a month here back in 2008, but of course your impressions of a place change from when you come as a visitor versus when you live there. One of the biggest challenges I had to overcome here was getting a job and finding a sense of stability, but I feel better for having done so. For me, migration means a constant conflict between the preservation of identity and trying to be well integrated in the host country. There are also the things that I miss about home, including my friends, family and the activities that used to make me happy. But even from afar I have been able to contribute my talents to my home country, through my volunteer work with several NGOs like Coup de Pouce, Elisa Asile and Essaim d'Accueil. One thing you have to keep in mind if you move, is that your home country will not be the same when you go back. And you won't be the same either! I do still feel most at home when I'm around the people I grew up with — anywhere, although it's most ideal when I'm in my home country. But along your journey you learn that even though people are different, with regards to nationality, culture and race, we are actually all alike because we share the same values. This is very important.
820	Saadia	Sudan	Egypt	A	A	close	1415	3609	E	im	female	I was raised in the Kurdufan region of Sudan. I left my country because of the bloodshed. When the war broke out & so many people were dying, my father & I tried to escape. We fled to a neighboring village and, mistaking it for a safe zone, we decided to stop. It was there that my father was killed and I was abused Four years later, I managed to run away again. I walked for days on end until I reached Khartoum. I was so young at the time, but I felt very responsible for my kids. We were all suffering from starvation. My kids were basically skin on bone After all I had gone through, I became extremely depressed, but I decided to carry my children and run towards a better future. I boarded a ferry to Egypt and prayed all the way that nobody would deport me back to Sudan. I was so ambitious and continuously fought against all circumstances to survive. I might have been the youngest person on that arduous journey, but I definitely had the strongest faith. The moment I arrived in Egypt, I discovered that I would face many hardships but I never allowed it to stop me from achieving success. I mightve been illiterate, but I taught myself to read. I studied for a Bachelors Degree in Pastoral & General Ministry. I even started the River of Life initiative, where I gathered 53 children to educate them about principles of the bible. I was able to convince them that, despite their current situation, they could eventually become successful human beings. Even If I get resettled in the United States, I know that I have left a mark on Egyptian society. Moving is never easy, but I think one must always maintain a spirit of positive involvement. For me, moving is a rebirth. When we are born, we are surprised by all the new people and places we encounter. We must always have the willingness to learn and be proactive in our new society. I bought Divine Clorox to clear my head and heart from all the bitterness in my past. I believe in life. So let us forget the cruelty of our past and look forward to a better future.
821	Sabina	Azerbaijan	Switzerland	I	E	far	4202	86919	H	im	female	When my partner was accepted to a university program in Lausanne, Switzerland, we decided to come here together. This was one of our shared experiences of the human phenomenon that is migration, however this was not my first experience. I have already been through it once before, when I, myself, came to the Netherlands as a refugee several years earlier. My own experiences as a refugee have always motivated me to do something for others. In my professional life, I have assisted qualified refugees with the integration process, which I have done for many years in the Netherlands and beyond. Since coming to Switzerland, I no longer deal professionally with migration, but this does not mean that the issues are far from my heart. I urge all people not to be afraid of new cultures that are different than their own. It is important for all new comers to learn about the culture and values of their new home.   Those in the host country should try not to put migrants into a box, because they are all different people with varied backgrounds. And remember that every migrant might have different needs and circumstances. So instead of insisting on offering help, we can try to learn from them, seeing them as strong individuals that are our equals, rather than people who automatically need help.
822	Sadija	Bosnia and Herzegovina	Germany	E	E	close	6035	45909	H	im	female	I came to Germany from the Bosnia-Herzegovina war zone in 1992, with my three small kids. In Sarajevo, the situation was very bad with snipers, grenade droppings etc. So I was very glad to be in a safe place with my children. It was nonetheless very difficult for me, because my parents and relatives were still in Bosnia and I had to leave my whole life behind me. Although I was happy to be safe, I was haunted by my war memories. I have strong organizational skills, a lot of confidence and I was not worried about doing something wrong just because I didn't know the laws here. So I achieved a lot of things. They said a refugee with a tolerated refugee status could not start an association, but I founded an association and also became its president. They also said that a refugee with a tolerated refugee status was not allowed to leave the municipality. However, I traveled back to the war zone hundreds of times and brought all the collected aid items there. I thought to myself, I am neither a prisoner nor a criminal. The German citizens gave me so much for my country, my people and children – I have to bring them what I receive. I said to myself, the police can arrest me when I come back – but they did not arrest me. The refugees arriving at the moment are not here because Mrs. Merkel said that, but because they want a safe life for their children. Every normal person would do the same in that situation. You go to the place offering safety and hope for the children. For me, it is important that we quickly start with integration efforts so that the refugees learn German and understand the way of life here. It's also important that they mingle quickly with the German population.

He runs a small business and also works as a cultural mediator for the Afghan community in Sofia, Bulgaria's Capital city. My wife is Bulgarian and I am from Afghanistan. The cultural difference does not matter if you love each other, which makes life beautiful. Afghans and Bulgarians are alike, for example if you ask someone something they immediately will give you advice and help you. Also, every Afghan loves their homeland. They are not just accustomed to the land, they see it as fate and are honored to be settled there. They are adapted to the big changes and have become part of the country. I graduated from an American college in Kabul after which I joined the military service in Afghanistan. A friend of mine told me very beautiful stories about Bulgaria and I decided I wanted to study there. From the ministry they tried to send me to East Germany, because a lot of people speak German and only eight million know Bulgarian. Nevertheless, I went to Bulgaria. I waited one year to get the call, after which I arranged the necessary documents and finally a date had been set for me to leave. I arrived and started a course at the university to learn the Bulgarian language. I continued studying, graduated from university and got married. Bulgaria feels like my second home and I have never regretted coming here instead of Germany. The last time I went back was in 1991, but because of the war I was not able to enter and was stopped at the border. The only thing I wanted was to see my father, so he came to the border to say goodbye. My brother, sister and other family members all live in Germany. I visit them every year, but when I get back and land at the airport in Sofia I feel better, because I am home again.
825	Said	Morocco	Estonia	A	E	far	3108	23106	H	im	male	"Im originally from Morocco, but I have a Spanish citizenship. Throughout the course of my life I can speak of three stages – when in the Canary Islands, Barcelona and Estonia.  In Morocco I studied archaeology and heritage. Im interested in conserving and rehabilitating archaeological and historic monuments. Life on the Canary Islands was the hardest, I went there to continue my studies. The scholarship I had did not cover my basic living costs so I had to work. As a student I needed to wait six months for a work permit, so I began working illegally at a night club on the weekends. It was a cultural shock for me to see all that I saw, but I had no other option. Later on I worked night shifts as a parking lot security guard. I worked six nights a week and went to university during the day. Even though I was very lonely, stressed and exhausted, I managed during my first year. In the second year I could not even read one page, I had to stop studying and focus on surviving. I realized change was needed, as I had initially come to study not take any job I could find, but I couldnt go back to Morocco. I had friends in Barcelona so I decided to move there, they helped me find a job at a post office. I was in contact with a spiritual Sufi community where I met a woman who later became my wife. Doing meditation at the centre helped me feel like part of the community. My situation changed completely. I now had a family and support to better understand the society.And I finally got to finish my master studies. My wife was a member of a dialogue group held by the UNESCO centre. People from different regions and beliefs met to discuss spiritual and social issues, how to live in peace, respect of the differences and growth for the common interest. I became very involved. I realized people are afraid of what they do not know. We organized events so that locals and different communities could meet. When crisis came the UNESCO centre needed to stop their activities, I began looking for jobs elsewhere. We had previously come to Estonia many times. My wifes son lives here and is married to an Estonian woman. We came to visit her grandchildren often. On our visits to Estonia we felt happy and peaceful. It was a hard decision but we thought we didnt have a job in Spain and we have family here, so why not come to Estonia. We moved in the spring of 2014 and I found a job after three months as a baker. At first it was difficult for my wife to find a job, but we had savings and the help of our family. Besides working as a baker Im doing other things like teaching refugees about Estonian culture, obligations, benefits, ultimately how to get integrated here. I can say that three things are needed to feel integrated in this society; first is to speak the language of the host country, get to know the culture and law of the country, and respect the culture and law of the host country. Its important to define what we mean and what is expected from integration. It is not to leave your culture, customs, tradition, but to find a way how to live together with peace, while working with the community.If there are those, who are dejected, before judging them, its important to speak with the person to know what happened. Maybe there is a reason behind the behaviour – rejection, negative experiences The role of the mediator is critical, as they need to be patient, understanding both the migrants and the local population. The mediator needs to find solutions. This role is something I did in Barcelona and I aspire to continue doing so here in Estonia."
826	Said	Somalia	Kenya	A	A	close	118	1879	H	im	male	"Saids daily life in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has become a testament to the struggle to survive for Somali refugees in an increasingly hostile country. The 42-year-old clothes seller turned rights activist divides his time in the Somali-dominated neighborhood of Eastleigh between detention centers, courtrooms and community meetings. He is available to help those caught up in police roundups get out of jail; to advise new arrivals on how to register with authorities; and to join Somali community leaders in petitioning the Kenyan government for more workable legislation to govern the lives of around 600,000 Somali refugees in the East African country. The already uphill battle took a turn for the worse in May 2016 when the government abruptly announced plans to close all refugee camps within its borders and decommission its Department of Refugee Affairs (DRA), effectively leaving unregistered arrivals in limbo. Just thinking about the idea of going back to Somalia gives us nightmares, said Said. My children were born here and theyre proud of that. We want our right as refugees to live in Kenya or to go to a third country legally. Just give us that chance, he pleads. Like many Somali refugees, Said fled to Kenya in the early 1990s after a vicious civil war consumed his home country, settling in Nairobi. His two biological children live with relatives in the Netherlands, but Said cares for seven more children, mainly nieces and nephews. There are widespread fears of a repeat of the notorious Usalama Watch in 2014, during which thousands of Somalis were rounded up in an effort to force refugees out of the city. It was a violent and indiscriminate operation, according to the independent watchdog Human Rights Watch, in which many lost homes and businesses, some were raped and others died. I know we are going to suffer, said Said. No one has advocated for those who died in 2014, those who lost their hands or legs, their jobs, their loved ones. Its been forgotten. Please, please, we dont want that to be repeated. Activists, including Said, point out that the refugees have the greatest interest in keeping the peace and rooting out extremists. Many of them have fled areas controlled by al-Shabaab to protect their children from being enlisted. Somali participation in efforts like Nymuba Kumi, where a voluntary security monitor is appointed for every 10 households, are evidence of this determination. We are ready to engage the government and help resolve any security problem, Said insisted. We are taxpayers, we work hard. Were learning from Kenyans, yet were also contributing and allowing Kenyans to learn from us, said Said. As many in his community keep a tense vigil to see whether the Kenyan government will go through with its public pronouncements, Said fears that some will choose the hard, illegal road to Europe, a choice he calls a suicide mission. Refugees are leaving for Europe [from Eastleigh]. We know people whove died. No one wants to risk being killed with a bullet, but they will risk dying at sea, said Said. Fleeing from your death to go toward death is a decision; its dying with freedom and the hope of reaching safety. Thats being human. Saids real name and photo have been withheld for the sake of his security."

They felt we would probably have a better chance of doing so here rather than back home. So, my father moved here two years before us. He had a job but he felt he needed to pick up another job; so he had two jobs while we were still in Jordan. He would send money, clothes, and all sort of stuff. After two years when he established himself and got an apartment, we moved here to rejoin him. It was difficult at the beginning. When my mom told us that we were going to move here, it was like moving to a whole different world. We were scared. We left our family, our friends, the home we grew up in, our culture, and our school. The thing that I was the most upset about is that it was 1998 and the World Cup was going on. With my buddies, we bought these books with the stickers of each player. Whoever got all the stickers and completed the book first won a prize. I was in the middle of doing that and then we had to move. I wasnt able to finish it. So, at 12 years old that was really my main concern. On a more serious note, I was scared. I thought 'I dont speak English well. Am I going to be able to make friends? Are they going to like me?' I didnt know what to expect, I was scared. I felt I had to restart my life all over again. At the beginning it was scary. It took a little while but we were able to adapt. Thats really the key to the move: you have to adapt. My model was and still is never forget your roots, just adapt to the new culture. Thats the message that I would preach to my kids and to anybody that is going to make a move like this. Dont forget your roots, dont forget where you come from but try to adapt and everything will be fine.

828	Sajad	Iraq	Austria	M	E	far	4146	48106	H	im	male	In 2015, more than 1 million people crossed the Mediterranean to reach Europe. One in four of them was a child. Children on the move have specific vulnerabilities and protection needs, and their journeys — by sea or over land — pose significant risks for them and their families, as well as challenges for European countries where people are on the move and at final destinations. Especially vulnerable children include those with disabilities and special needs, who find very little or no specialized services available throughout their journey. Sajad Al-Faraji, 15, and his family, from Iraq, took a refugee train first from Preševo to Croatia. Stress and fatigue are among the added risks that children face. On arrival in Austria, Sajad, sick and exhausted, had to spend the entire day at Kurier Haus, a processing centre for refugees in Vienna, the capital, where he and his family are applied for asylum. Sajads sister, Houda Al-Malek, began the application process for the family. My mother took the risk and decided to leave Iraq, she said. She told me she was ready to die in the sea, but the most important thing was that I take my brothers to the country I choose. The family, although safely at their final destination, had to go through the complex registration and documentation process. Sajads brother, Zein Alabdien, 13, was photographed as part of documentation procedures that refugees and migrants on the move undergo. Houda, behind him with Sajad and their mother, says: Here there is security, but back in Iraq there is no security. Iraq is full of bad things. Speaking about their journey, Houda said: We faced enormous difficulty then, but when we crossed to this country things got a little bit better. With the registration and documentation completed, Zein, Sajad and their mother, Fatima Al-Hammoudi, begin exploring the capital. At times the family had to buy four tickets to get on a train only to find there were no seats. Sajad had to sleep in the aisle, and the family had to put luggage on top of him. Everything is beautiful here, Sajad said, taking in the sights in Vienna. He, his mother and his sister also enjoyed a visit to Viennas Cafe Central. My mom keeps saying that people here received us with empathy and, here, individuals have their own protected rights, Houda said. Sajad enjoys watching sports shows on TV. He would like to become an athlete. Sajad, who became paralyzed at one month of age following a botched surgery that damaged his spine, faced mobility issues during his entire journey. Everything … everything is beautiful, Sajad said, looking at paintings in the Picture Gallery during the familys visit to Viennas Kunsthistorisches Museum (Museum of Art History). All the pictures I saw … I liked them all. My brother and I give Sajad the utmost support. Houda said. He will be somebody one day but this will be through education and learning. Its very important to learn the language as a first step. Zein admires the mirrored ceiling while riding with his family in a lift at the museum. Sajad, viewing the Egyptian and Near Eastern collection, said: The thing that surprised me most was the museum. It was very nice, full of beautiful things that represented the Egyptian and the Babylonian civilizations. The Al-Faraji family now live in a temporary shelter at an abandoned hospital outside the capital. With refugee housing in the city filled to capacity, volunteers have had to find shelter for arriving refugees and migrants who have nowhere to stay.   People staying at this shelter receive three meals a day. Sajad said: I have no dream whatsoever, and Houda added: Certainly he will have a better life here. He is still not that open-minded, but I believe he has a better chance here.   The shelter also has a recreation space, giving children a safe place to play. Sajad plays table football with other children. Im thankful to God, he said. Now I feel comfortable as long as my family is well and comfortable.   The family smiles in the communal sleeping space. We owe it to my mom that we were able to reach this place. Houda says. Concerted action is urgently needed to give all children on the move — with or without a disability — a fair chance at life.
829	Sajjad	United Kingdom	Belgium	E	E	close	40718	45028	E	im	male	I am a Lancastrian by birth, because I was born in Lancashire, so that makes me English and British. I am also European. My parents came to the UK from Pakistan, and I am a Muslim. So like many people in Europe, I am a person with multiple layers of identity, but that is of course what provides us with our greatest strength – diversity. For me, home is Lancashire in the UK, but of course on a broader context home is Europe. For me, the United Kingdom is a part of Europe. I have for many years been a direct witness of racism and discrimination, and I have directly experienced both. Things have changed for the better over the past few decades, but based upon recent political developments there is a real need to reenergize in order to fight discrimination and racism. Messages of division, intolerance and hate have found their way into our mainstream political discourse. All of us have to work together to reject these ideas. Our continent has been built by newcomers, who bring ideas, energies and strengths to develop and move forward – economically and socially. The arrival of newcomers ready to make positive contributions, this is within our own short, medium and long term interest. This is something that I welcome.
830	Salih and Hussein	Iraq	Iraq	M	M	close	4146	4146	E	hc	n	My name is Salih and I was born on April 1992 in Zakho, a city in Iraq. I have three brothers and four sisters. My father was the only member of our family who had a job and we were facing serious financial problems. I decide to leave school and find a job. I was a taxi driver, I worked in a mini market and finally I worked as a carpenter in my uncles business. I wasnt happy at all and I decide to go to Europe to find a better job. I met Hussein when we were trying to reach the European borders. He is also a carpenter and married with four children. He lost his job due to economic crisis and he also decided to reach Europe looking for a higher income. We went to Turkey and we started planning our trip to Europe. First stop was Greece and then Italy. However we got arrested by the Italian authorities, stayed in prison for about three months and sent back to Greece. Thinks were very difficult in Athens. We had nowhere to stay, no money and no food to eat. We were 8 months away from our families. Our friendship was becoming stronger day by day and we started realizing that we made a big mistake leaving our home country. We found out about IOM from other migrants interested in voluntary returns. We visited IOM in Athens and we were informed that we can apply for the reintegration assistance. IOM staff examined and approved our application, given the fact that we are both carpenters. A new job in Iraq was expecting us! We were very happy. Our new carpentry business became a reality a few months ago and now it is going really well! Thanks to IOM, we can now financially support our families and be more optimistic about our childrens future.
831	Salome	Georgia	Georgia	I	I	close	3984	3984	E	hc	female	"Ms Salome, aged 27, was living in Greece with her mother for more than 5 years when she decided to return in Georgia due to financial issues. Her plan was to open a after school day care centre for children unlike the usual ones, where children will be involved in various creative and artist activities; not just a place only for reading school books. This plan, which was just an idea for many years, was impossible to be implemented due to financial restraints. However, through the reintegration assistance in kind of IOM Greece, the returnee finally managed to implement her plan with success in her home town, Kutaisi. The after school day care centre opened in November 2017. Fairytales, drawing, reading and TV documentaries or cartoons (depending on the age group) are just some of the activities with which she keeps the children busy. Ms Salome is being assisted by her sister, Sophie, who is also very experienced in this area. The care centre profits approximately 430 GEL per month, while the school fees are usually 50 GEL per month for every child who is registered in the centre. Beneficiary mentions that the monthly income is very satisfying and is sufficient enough in order to make savings as well. Ms Salome and her sister Sophie expressed their gratitude towards IOM Greece since this business plan could never be a reality without the Reintegration assistance of IOM. Their near-future plan is to extend the centre, as work is gradually increasing."
832	Salome	Kenya	Ireland	A	E	far	1879	86251	H	im	female	"I was born in Kenya and worked as a social worker for five years before I came to Ireland as a student. I chose Ireland because an Irish priest in Kenya had baptized me; I felt I already had a strong connection to the country. When I first arrived in Ireland in 1994, I was a novelty. I was a 'good thing' and people wanted to engage with me. I went back to Kenya to work with homeless children for a while and then in 1998 I came back to Europe and everything was different. Ireland was now doing well - the economy was booming but somehow the perception of migrants had inversely gone down. That's when I started the NGO Akina Dada wa Africa-AkiDwA (Swahili for sisterhood). I wanted to engage with my own community and help women. When I first arrived in Ireland, migrants did not want to go there actually. But with the booming economy, many people started to arrive and locals got scared. I remember when I first bought a house, people were scared that it would start smelling of spicy food. It was as if seeing a person of color in my village was threatening in itself. Those people are now the most supportive. Part of the reason why is that I made people see me differently. Now, the mood is better. We might not have yet migrants at the decisionmaking level but they are starting businesses and getting established in the country. The fear of the unknown and ignorance of people not wanting to know is what leads to racism. In some way, Irish people are like Africans. You need to share a cup of tea with someone to start opening up. I believe that governments need to invest in helping people to know each other better. Societies should be inclusive and for that we need to hear the voices of migrants, especially women migrant voices."
833	Sam	Ethiopia	United Kingdom	A	E	far	840	40718	H	im	male	"I arrived in the UK with my family at the start of the millennia, age 5 and speaking very little English. During the next 6 years, we lived in 7 different addresses and I attended 6 separate primary schools. Starting secondary school in 2005, a special music comprehensive placed in special measures by Ofsted, only 36% of students achieved at least 5 A*-C GCSEs that year, with classes sometimes having upward of 30 students. The constant transition that characterised my experience of the UK state education system continued: frequent changes of governance and changes to the curriculum seemed ineffectual to improving terrible standards. In short, it wasn't the best environment for learning. Despite this, I gained a well-rounded education and had opportunities to push myself academically, culturally and socially; for instance, a mentoring scheme during my GCSEs which broadened my very limited horizons. Starting my A-levels in 2010 was a transformation - I took up debating, read widely, attended educational events, researched university choices and decided to apply to Oxford for PPE. Before my A-levels, I had no idea what PPE was and knew little to nothing about Oxford. Preparing for applications and interviews with the sixth-form team, I was subsequently offered a place. At university I have been fortunate to study a fantastic course, meet incredibly intelligent people and experience new things - studying broadly, travelling widely and gaining extensive professional experiences such as a placement in Beijing and an IBD summer internship with Goldman Sachs. At Oxford, most of all, I have had the freedom to think. Given my father had to leave home in rural Ethiopia to gain an education, I see studying in the UK as a right that I am privileged to have. Immigrants have dreams and many are successful, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise."
834	Samad	Afghanistan	Afghanistan	I	I	close	508	508	E	hc	male	I am originally from Afghanistan, but my family left for Iran when I was two or three years old, fleeing after years of physical and mental torture in Afghanistan. I was too young when we left to remember my initial impressions of Iran, but there isn't much I miss about my home country. I've been a refugee my whole life, but I know that all the experiences I've had contribute to my desire to help others regardless of their background or the terms that might apply to them. It has been important to me, during my time in Iran, to share my knowledge to help others where possible. I have worked as a translator, volunteered to organize activities to foster integration and stood up for migrant rights whenever I could. Still, I know that the journey away from home can be difficult and dark for some. The more time I spend in Iran, the more I turn the question of migration around in my mind. For those who are considering it, I would tell them to take their time to learn the culture of the place they are going to, and to remember that as humans they are not different, but their pure culture might make them feel out of place in the beginning. For those in host countries: do not be afraid by media, trust your heart to see the realities of a world on the move. I have no clear idea what home is, because it's something that can be destroyed at any moment. But my advice for anyone arriving in a new country is to show the people who you really are - you'll start to feel the difference.
835	Samba	Guinea-Bissau	Niger	A	A	close	668	568	E	im	male	"I left Guinea-Bissau five years ago because it was too painful to live in such poverty. My father is dead and I have many siblings to look after. I used to be a painter in Guinea, but the work wasnt well-paid so I left by myself to look for money elsewhere. One of my brothers had tried to go to Italy via Libya but was sent back to Guinea-Bissau; I decided to give it a try by crossing the desert. During my years in Libya, I was detained twice. The first time, I was on the shore ready to board the boat when the police caught me. The conditions were decent in the prison there; we were not beaten up and we were fed when they had food. My family eventually sent me money so I could get out of prison, and someone negotiated my freedom for me. Getting people out of jail is a business… like anywhere else! After that, I moved to Sabha and started working as a painter. One night, bandits attacked the house I was living in with a few other people, asked for our passports and tore them apart. They locked us in the house and forced me to call my family every day to get money. A friend of mine who had kept some of my money negotiated my second release. Before that, I had never planned to stay in Libya for long, but I had worked for so long without any pay that I had no means to go back home. People took advantage of me and made me work for nothing. And trust me… you had better do what they tell you to do. Unfortunately it is now almost considered normal to behave like this with us migrants. Some people say that everybody has their luck, but I wouldnt advise anyone to take this route. I cant describe how happy I felt when I left and finally crossed the Nigerien border. When I go back home, I want to continue painting. Thats what makes me happy."
836	Samba	Mauritania	Niger	A	A	close	1702	568	E	im	male	I left Mauritania almost a year ago to go to Europe. What pushed me was the desire to study and help out my parents. I want them to be happy. It makes me sad when I think about what I left behind. I spent almost two months in prison in Libya. They beat us, tortured us, shot at people. I had no contact with my family so they all thought I was dead. It was really hard on all of us. An Arab helped me and some other people to get out of prison. After two weeks of working for him, he set us free. He then offered me paid work so I stayed with him. During my fourth month there, his sons attacked me in the middle of the night. They told me to give them all my money and then chased me out. I didnt even have time to get my things. I was badly hurt. I went to a Nigerien next door to ask for help. He told me that I could stay with him. The next day he brought me traditional medicine. In Libya, if you are attacked like that, you dont go to the doctors. I stayed with him for 20 days until I recovered. He fed me, took care of me – he did everything for me. After that, my brother sent me money so I started my trip back home. When you dont know where to go, its better to go back where you came from. Thats not to say that if I had the money, I wouldnt try again to go to Europe. Theres this saying: if you dont have a mother to breastfeed you, you go to your grandmother. Its hard, but if you have no other choice, you have to do it. In Libya, everything you earn, you end up spending on bail, and the journey to Europe is very difficult. An hours drive can even take a day in certain places. However, the things Ive endured are a life lesson to me. You dont truly know the value of your country until youve gone through something like this. Its not about the money anymore, its about the experience – thats what makes the difference. Some brothers made some money, some didnt, some were left behind in the Sahara, while others drowned. On my way back, I saw people that had done 10 days in the Sahara with barely any food or water. There were a few dead among them. It was a sad thing to see. I left Mauritania for Europe, but I wasnt prepared for what I saw on the road. At the end of the day, we are responsible for everything that happens to us. They told me not to go, but I went anyway. Mans biggest problem is man himself.

838	Samer	Syrian Arab Republic	Saudi Arabia	M	M	close	890	20110	H	im	male	I left the most beautiful place in the world, Aleppo, in 2009 before the war started. My link to the Syrian community now is a network of friends and relatives. When we gather in a café or restaurant and exchange various stories about home—sharing our culture, past experiences, food, and speaking of places in Syria, it is like we relive joyful moments again in minute detail. On some unconscious level, it satisfies our home sickness to a certain degree. When you live and work in a country where there are a myriad of different nationalities, being a part of your home country expatriate community helps you fit in more quickly because there are always some of your co-nationals who have lived here longer than you and have therefore experience from which you can benefit. Some friends want to go to Europe or Australia or the United States and make a life, and if I had the chance to go now while the war is still going on, I would. Another friend suggested staying in Saudi and saving money rather than risking a life of unknowns. But I want to go home—Syria is somewhere I have a right to be, without living in fear that one day Saudi will no longer need foreign labor, or that another country I might move to will decide not to protect Syrians anymore. I think the major role of the Syrian expatriate community is rebuilding Syria when the war is over, which will be soon (I fervently hope). When the war is over, there will be a great demand for professional workers. We all need to go back and employ our skills, experience and specialties to meet the various needs after the war. And being home would be a relief.
839	Samir	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	male	Im originally from Syria. I left in 2015 at 19 years old, because I was a mechanical engineering student and my university was bombed several times. I wanted to know what freedom tasted like. First I went to Lebanon, and from there I took the Balkan path to Germany – the whole journey took six days. When I first got to Berlin I was struck by how massive the city is. Its a mix of modernism and dark history, like a party in a graveyard! But there is still a lot I miss about Syria: my family, the climate, the architecture, my university library, the fresh juice sellers, and my favourite bookstore in the old city. Right now my main goal is to carry out some scientific research, as a way of contributing to the country Im living in now. I also bring a liberal way of thinking, adding balance to the existing group of Syrians in the German society. After getting my post-graduate degree, I want to work on renewable energy sources in Syria, using German theoretical and practical experiences in the field. Nevertheless, going to the right university is my biggest challenge, and a step that Ive been working on since 2016. I know am so close now. My message to everyone in Syria is that everything has an end, bad times and good times, no matter who you are. Enjoy being alone. Don't be afraid of your own company. My definition of home is a place where you coexist with space for a long period of time, where you can see memories in every corner, and where you get that good feeling that comes with belonging.
840	Samo	Syrian Arab Republic	Portugal	M	E	far	890	22413	H	im	male	I landed in Portugal on June6, 2016. I came alone through the EU Relocation Program. I left my country when the situation became unbearable, although I had never imagined I would have to leave Syria one day. It did not make sense. I had a career in interior design, I had my family and friends there, and I already had a planned date for my wedding. Life was good and I enjoyed living in Aleppo. It was not until my bride to be died that I decided to risk everything and cross the Mediterranean. During the first attempt our boat capsized so we spent five hours adrift until we were finally rescued by the Turkish authorities. I could only reach a Greek island on my third attempt, in February 2016. It was such a disappointment to reach the Macedonian border and realize that it was closed. When I began looking for alternatives, I was told about the relocation program, in which we could pick 8 countries and be eventually sent to one. Like many other people in the same situation, my dream was to go to Northern Europe, to Norway. After a few weeks, I got the news that my application had been approved by Portugal. I remember reviewing my collection of stams from 225 countries – one of the few items I had carefully brought with me from Syria - and looking for any Portuguese stamp. I had none, so I took it as a good opportunity to get one. When I arrived in Portugal I felt really lonely. Speaking English helped me to make friends and communicate more easily. After two Portuguese courses I am now able to speak in Portuguese. Had I been told years ago that one day I would be speaking in Portuguese I would probably have laughed and thought it would be impossible. Today, I am surprised by the number of Portuguese words that are similar to Arabic, among those are sugar (açúcar – as-sukkar), rice (arroz – ar-ruz), or cotton (algodão – al-kutun). I miss working. I was an interior designer for 15 years in Aleppo. Nobody leaves their country to seek help. Everyone wants to work and be independent. I hope I will be able to do so in Lisbon one day. This year I had the chance to start studying architecture in a university in Lisbon. In spite of the difficulties of studying in Portuguese, this opportunity has been a great source of motivation. In order to fill my free time, I volunteer in homeless associations in Lisbon. I go there two times a week to help distribute food in Santa Apolónia, Rossio and Saldanha, with people who also need help and I take this as an opportunity to practice my Portuguese and meet new people too.
841	San	Cambodia	Thailand	I	I	close	1513	7189	E	im	female	I left Cambodia for Thailand when I was 29 in search of a better job, but also to escape my fragile situation at home. A well-connected friend who already lived in Bangkok told me to come here, assuring me that there was a job here lined up for me, so I took the bus from Pratabong with a group of friends until we reached the border of Thailand. In Cambodia I was earning half of what I earned when I arrived in Thailand. At home I used to make cookies and sell them at the market. My parents taught me how to cook them and I did it until they passed away. When I arrived here in the beginning I was doing unskilled labour, mostly cleaning. It wasnt until years later that I started cooking. I worked for 10 years for the same restaurant until I opened my own food stall. I have one daughter who is 10 years old and lives with her relatives, 40 km away from Bangkok. I take the bus every weekend to see her. She used to study here but I was too busy with work to properly take care of her, so I decided it was best she moved in with her father. I send her an allowance for her studies and clothes each month. I used to visit home once or twice a year but now I only go every two or three years because its too expensive to travel, and every time I go back to my hometown I have to spend a lot of money on presents for my relatives. I have six brothers and sisters, all married with lots of kids. I have my own business now so I dont think I would want to move back and my daughter is still studying so I wouldnt be able to leave her. Also, since she is Thai, she doesnt know the Cambodian dialect so she would have a hard time adapting. I would like to go back more often though only to visit, not to settle down. I miss Cambodia and my family especially, but I have to work. Although things are improving and Cambodia is developing a lot right now, I have been absorbed by the Thai culture. My life in Thailand is definitely better than the one I had in Cambodia. I love Bangkok, shopping, watching movies and especially Thai soap operas that make me cry.

When I moved to the new country it was a different feeling, it was an incredibly beautiful town and very lovely. I felt integrated easily, I believe thats thanks to my previous travels abroad for work in different countries covering stories of women; including Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Kenya, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. There were moments when I felt like a stranger, but I think it is normal, at the end of the day I come from another environmental background and thats the beautiful thing about being migrant; you see the world from other peoples eyes perspectives. It was easy task to manage the new mix of cultures, since I come from a country full of diversity, I always loved that, cultures are beautiful, and for me I got to eat delicious food thanks to that. What I miss most from back home is my social life and family. Yet, technology made our life easier, basically I feel like Im home thanks to that. Id say my home is everywhere; Im a citizen of the world. Every day, I bring a new perspective and try to set an example that a migrant is a source of positive energy and an added value of sustainable development. I have founded Womenpreneur, an initiative that bridges between women in MENA and European regions, we empower women to be active agents of changes, and through that platform those women to share their beautiful experiences. My mission in life is identifying, promoting and providing support for women and youth to be agents of change. I want to continue to be that bridge where migrants contribute to the development of their host and home countries."
843	Sana	Pakistan	Greece	I	E	far	1167	18117	H	im	female	Sana is a young man from Pakistan who, after spending 1.5 year in Greece, decided to go back to his country as a beneficiary of the Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration Programme, a core activity of IOM Greece. I come from a village not far from the city of Gujrat in Pakistan, but I used to live in Karachi, where I worked as a driver. I decided to migrate first to Saudi Arabia, where I spent 2.5 years but things didnt work out for me so I went back to Pakistan. I have heard so many stories about Greece: that its a beautiful country full of history, with great weather and nice people. I really wanted to come and so I did. I left 1.5 years ago from Pakistan. It took me 16 days to traverse Iran and Turkey, before crossing by boat to the island of Lesbos, in the midst of the refugee crisis. I used every means available to make the journey, I walked a lot. When leaving Pakistan, I thought it would be easy for me to get a job in Greece – although Ive heard of the financial crisis, I was confident that, despite the difficulties, Id find my way. I ended up in the island of Crete, in the region of Iraklion, where I took various jobs in agriculture, working in fields and farms. I had a good time there, people have been nice to me and although one hears stories about migrant workers being taken advantage of, that was not my case. I also loved Iraklion city and particularly the port, beautiful and alive. However, as time went by, I grew more and more homesick. My parents and my three siblings still live in our village and I want to be with them again. Im also really glad that I will be able to start my own business with the assistance of IOM Greece, as a part of their Reintegration programme. I will start a pharmacy with the help of my uncle, whos a pharmacist and he has trained me in the past. So, I feel optimistic about my future in Pakistan. You know, most Pakistanis feel very much at home in Greece – I hope I will be back some day!

Today, I can't say today I'm reacher than when I arrived at the US, but my six children, who all live in Guatemala, have university degrees and have a living wage which allows them to support their families. I came to this city in 1988. In Guatemala, the economic situation was difficult for a single woman without a higher level of education. To survive with six children, I had no choice but to migrate. The hardest thing was to leave them, to be separated from my family. I worked for a long time without papers, but I was lucky enough to meet my husband, an American citizen, who supported me in my naturalization procedures in the country. That gave me the opportunity to return to Guatemala to see my children again, but I decided to continue working in Los Angeles because the situation was still the same in my country. Even having documents, it is difficult to go see my children. Having documents does not mean that I can move when I want, because I must continue to earn my salary. At one point I was paying university studies for three of my children, which required a lot of economic investment. Now I see them every four years. I am a seamstress in the garment industry, and I think that those who migrate without papers are currently suffering a lot because their work dynamics are added to the fear of deportation. Migrants here get up early, work in a double shift, almost 16 hours a day; they also travel great distances. These situations should not occur. It is unfortunate that in our countries it is not possible to create better opportunities to achieve a dignified life and the development of families. The people of Guatemala make great economic contributions, both here and in their community, but it is unfortunate that they do not have permits, cannot have better wages. I did not want my children to become cheap labor for another country, but to be professionals and contribute to their country. With a profession it is possible, but if the governments themselves do not guarantee education, that is where the situation becomes difficult. New communication technologies have been great tools to feel my kids closer. The Internet was a godsend because in my time, in 1988, when I arrived in America, I could talk with them twice a year; I paid for the calls in several installments since each one was between $200 and $250. One of my sons works at a government institution and can afford Internet access from home.  Now we can communicate with video calls at a reasonable cost every night. Every afternoon, passing through this place (intersection of Bonnie Brae and 6th Street, Los Angeles, California), I take an atolito de elote. This reminds me of one of the greatest traditions that families have in Guatemala City, also eating an enchilada. It allows me to stay connected with my country and its people. It was worthwhile to migrate. If once again I had the opportunity to do it to support my children, I would do it again."
846	Sandra	Netherlands	Bulgaria	E	E	close	53334	10058	L	im	female	"I came to Bulgaria because I wanted to try something new after I graduated from university. I decided that I wanted to work abroad and I had already met a lot of very nice Bulgarian people in the Netherlands. Additionally, I have an East European background and I wanted to know what it is like to live in another part of Europe. My mother is from Ukraine and my dad from Syria. I lived in both countries and in Russia when I was younger but grew up in the Netherlands. When moving to a new place you expect everything to be different but there are always a few things that you assume as standard, that are the same in every place; but even those small ordinary things can turn out to be totally different. For example, in the Netherlands it is polite to take a decision right away and not wait too long. Here in Bulgaria I feel it is more polite to wait a little longer before answering anything. Also, you expect nonverbal language to be the same everywhere. So when nodding no you actually mean no and not as in Bulgaria when people nod no they actually mean to say yes. This has led to some funny moments here. Even though I know this is the Bulgarian way and I had visited Bulgaria before, sometimes when I order and the waitress nods no it takes me a few seconds to understand that she is actually saying yes to my order. In the beginning when I decided that I wanted to move here it was pretty easy. I took the decision and I continued my life in the Netherlands. Two weeks prior to my move, after I found a job and my ticket was booked, I started to become more nervous. I had to say goodbye to my friends and family, and I realized that I was leaving my life in the Netherlands behind me. I never regret moving, I think it adds a lot to your life to live somewhere new and unknown."

To do so, she first spent a month at the infamous Des Mille Collines Hotel which, in her words, no longer felt like a hotel: it was a shelter more than it was a hotel. They were eventually evacuated by peace-keepers and crossed the border to Uganda where they spent two weeks in a camp. Thanks to ties her mother had with Nuns who were on mission in Luxembourg, they managed to fly to Italy and then to Luxembourg where Sandrine now lives. Today she has been naturalized as Luxembourgish.  I am not a nationality, I am a person » says Sandrine who now spends her time training companies and organizations in a view to achieve greater cultural diversity among staff and to facilitate intercultural conversation between team members. She also volunteers for a renowned human rights NGO where she invests much of her time and energy and she is also pursuing a Masters degree in Luxembourg, having already completed a bachelors degree in philosophy. Sandrine is definitely a migrant. But as she puts it, she is also a woman, a professional, a volunteer and a student. Each migrant has a story to tell, a story that renders his/her experience unique ».
848	Sandy	Guatemala	United States	L	N	far	4332	63123	H	im	female	"After the experience of a very troubled marriage and a very complicated separation, I came to the United States with the purpose to work and raise my income to give education to my 7 year old son. Being a single parent in a rural community around Sanarate, El Progreso, is very complicated from an economic perspective, it became very difficult to earn money to support my son. Life in the US is difficult, not only because you dont know the people, the rules and the culture but the language. When you have your family close, everything is better, but I cannot go back because of my status. After three years, I have already a family in the United States, which has helped me to complement my life. I never imagined working in the area where I work, manicure and pedicure. The business is full with people from many nationalities; people with different characteristics and accents, but my personality has helped me win many customers and good tips, this allowed me to improve my family's income in Guatemala and especially for my child to go to school. What I like most about America is the diversity of areas and places where you can find decent work. Such opportunities are not in my place of origin. I miss Guatemalan food a lot. It is a very beautiful country, but when you have no money is very difficult to go visit touristic sites and learn. I wish I could have visited more places in my country. When I was 16 I migrated to the city, rented a room and found work in a textile factory. Somehow, when I came to New York, I was already familiar with the idea of adapting to new environments and urban areas. Adapting to new cultures, cities and people is very easy compared to how big it means having to leave your family to give them better economic opportunities."

With this knowledge Santoso migrated in the nineties to the country that he mainly knew from his parents' tales. He usually found work, but in the last few years before his return it became increasingly difficult due to the lack of a residence permit. Santoso stayed in the Netherlands for more than twenty years. In 2016 he returned to his homeland in Bandung, Indonesia. Initially, his plan was to start a restaurant. He had been working in the catering industry all his life. But he changed his mind and with the help of IOM's Return and Reintegration program, he decided to purchase a scooter to start a taxi company. In a city like Bandung, that has more than 2.5 million inhabitants, he has enough customers. Santoso works hard on his reintegration in Indonesia, but he hasn't forgotten the Netherlands. The transition was big. Now that he is back in Indonesia that feeling of being homesick sometimes comes back towards the Netherlands.
850	Sara	Iran	Australia	M	O	far	11183	55823	E	im	female	We will never forget the day we landed at Sydney airport. We packed our whole life in two pieces of luggage. Despite having no family and friends in Australia, we had so much hope and enthusiasm to build a better future. I spent 8 years of my childhood during the Iran & Iraq war, yet I believe migration was one of the most valuable and toughest experiences in my life. Starting our lives from scratch, demonstrating our skills and building trust in the new country was not that easy. Migration definitely broadens our horizons. Every day is about learning something new, especially in a multicultural country like Australia. We always remember those days when, as newly arrived migrants, my husband sent 100 job applications per week. He is a senior qualified engineer but just one company got back to him within a 6 month period. At the moment he is a successful manager in the second biggest mining company in Australia, and I currently have the privilege to assist other migrants in Australia & Pacific region. My dream is to assist more migrants on a global scale and see their success and happiness. We both strongly believe that when theres a will, there is a way.  Keep focusing on your goals and never forget happiness and hope, even if you are thousand kilometres away from home and family, even if you need to work so hard to learn the new language and culture. Statistics indicate that the majority of migrants become successful and productive in their new countries and that they actively contribute to build their second home for future generations.
851	Sara	Nigeria	Niger	A	A	close	2085	568	E	im	female	I left Nigeria to look for better opportunities to provide for my siblings and I. My mom is a cashier and my dad is a farmer, but they couldnt support us with their salaries. We often helped them out, but we werent making enough money for me to be able to continue my studies in business administration. When an acquaintance told me there might be work for me in Austria, I jumped on the opportunity. She told me how good Austria was so I figured I would just get there, find work and settle in. They told me the journey was easy so I decided to give it a go. When we finally made it to Niger, we got excited about getting closer to our dreams, but we never reached Libya. The only thing I saw on this trip was the desert. Our driver saw a few soldiers on the way and got scared so he abandoned us in the desert, taking all of our belongings with him: food, water, clothes and the 250,000 Francs CFA I had saved up for the trip. We spent the next four days without any food or water. There were 53 of us when we got stranded, but by the end there were only about 30 left. One by one, my fellow Nigerians died and we had to dig a humongous hole for all the bodies. Some of the migrants decided to go look for help, but I decided to stay. There is no one to help you in desert – there is nothing but death all around. They never came back. That place is like hell on earth. I tried to cover my head with a cardigan for the whole time, but it wasnt big enough to cover my face as well. I found some sauce which I put on my legs to protect them from the sun, but it only made it worse. I have burns everywhere. When I was there, in the middle of the desert, with the sun burning my skin, I thought that was the end. I kept praying to God to save me. I was so grateful when the Nigerien soldiers rescued us and took us to IOMs transit centre in Dirkou. I arrived at the centre with no bra or underwear – just a dress. There they treated our wounds, fed us and gave us water. At the centre, I called my family to let them know I was alive and coming back home. Once we reached Dirkou, 15 people decided to go back and risk their lives again. It was mostly women with children - I couldnt believe it. I am happy I was rescued, I am happy I was taken to IOMs transit centre, and Im even happy to go back now. I wouldnt advise anyone to take this journey - try to find work at home and make a life for yourself there.
852	Sara	Portugal	Belgium	E	E	close	22413	45028	E	im	female	I left my life and a job I loved in Lisbon, to accompany my husband to Brussels, where he is currently on military duty. Logistically speaking, moving was not hard for me. Everything was planned ahead and organized. However, that is not all one has to keep in mind. Back in Portugal I used to be a teacher, so I was used to having a lot of life and movement around me. I remember the first months in Belgium, when I was often overwhelmed and saddened by the constant silence around me. After a while however, it got better. After living in Brussels for a while, for the first time I felt that compared to Belgium, Portugal was a poor country. The standard of living here is much higher than back home, the buildings are nice and the architecture is beautiful. Then again, at home I am used to people helping each other randomly on streets, in Belgium people seem to bit a little bit more reserved. When talking to fellow artists and friends back in Portugal, I always tell them how much I enjoy living in Brussels. Truly, everything is available here. If you are looking for a place where they play free jazz, you will find one. If you want to discover new artistic expressions or even express yourself, there are a lot of avenues, a lot of possibilities and a lot of places to go to. Something funny here are the kisses. In Portugal we give two kisses and the people who only give one are seen as uptight. So here I always try to give two kisses and it can lead to funny situations. Its the small aspects of daily life that take a while to figure out and get used to – how to take the bus or where get a haircut. Most of all I miss the little things. I miss the sun, the beach and Portuguese coffee. I actually miss being able to go to places where you can drink coffee and have a piece of cake. In Belgium, it is usually one or the other. Looking back, I realize that I was always afraid to move when I was younger. Knowing how enriching the experience can be and has been for me, if I could do it all over again, I would move as soon as I had graduated.
853	Sara	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	female	Before you go on the boat, people tell you that you are going to die. So the first thing you think about when you get on that boat is dying, you don't think of anything else. My sister, Yusra and I were not afraid of dying. We knew we could reach Greece, we were professional swimmers back in Syria. I said to her 'if the boat capsizes dont try to help others, just come and swim with me. We cant help everybody, we are too many people.' But when the engine stopped and the boat started deflating, I felt that I cannot let the other 20 people drown and just save my own life. It wouldn't be fair. I thought it was my duty to jump in the water. And if I die and those 20 people are still alive, thats great. When I die people would remember me for this. But if I leave them I would feel bad with myself for the rest of my life. A friend of my dad who was with us jumped in the water. Then I followed. He told me to go back but I didnt do it. We needed to have much less weight on the boat and nobody else could swim. When I first got in water my whole body was shaking like before competition, when you know that all the other swimmers are so strong. I couldnt hear my mind, I just ignored it. I tried focusing on that moment, I didn't want to think about anything else. After a while my clothes started to really weigh me down. I asked my dads friend to cut off the legs of my trousers. I was getting really tired. It got difficult to breathe because I have asthma and I was getting a lot of salt water into my lungs. I was trying to stay awake. I knew that if I was not paying attention I would fall asleep and die. I was in the water for two hours already. It was getting dark and cold, the wind was blowing. I was freezing. I could not open my eyes anymore, they were full of salt water. The journey normally takes one hour. It took us three hours. When we finally arrived at the island it was almost midnight and I was exhausted. Until that moment I have always imagined that in such a situation I would only try to save my life. But at that very moment felt that life was bigger than me alone. All the people on that boat were part of me. When I finally got signal on my phone I was afraid to call my mom. I had lost my voice almost completely and I knew she would be worried. I couldnt send her a photo of myself either, I looked like I had been beaten up - I could hardly open my eyes from all the salt and my face was covered in bruises. I spoke to my dad. He was so proud of me. He said 'You are my man,' he didnt say 'You are my girl.' I felt that I had really achieved something big.
854	Sara and her family	Iraq	Greece	M	E	far	4146	18117	E	im	female	Sara is a little girl from Sinjar, Iraq. After spending one year in Greece, she relocated to Germany together with her family. We have arrived on March 2nd, 2016 on the island of Samos, recalls Samir, her father, just a few hours before boarding the plane to Germany. However, we left Iraq long ago. We come from Sinjar, a predominantly Yazidi city – we are Yazidi, too. In the summer of 2014, Sinjar fell to the ISIS offensive. Thousands of our people were massacred. I had no choice but to take my family away from danger, first in Kurdistan and a few weeks later to Turkey. I feel lucky, I didnt lose family members, thankfully. All I wanted was to secure a future for my children. Sara plays nearby with her brother, while her mother, Harby, grooms the youngest of the family, Samra. Sara is a lively girl with almond eyes. While staying at the Skaramagkas accommodation centre, on the outskirts of Athens, she got enrolled to the Greek elementary school where she took Greek and English classes. School is fantastic she says. I couldnt wait to go and every day, when I came back home, I was telling my parents every little detail of my day. My teachers are so nice, I love them very much and Im going to miss them. Samir listens, smiling. We were very happy to send her to school here in Greece, it made Sara so happy. And our experience in the country is very positive, we felt accepted by the Greeks. You know, we lost everything in Sinjar, I even left my dreams there. So, now that were finally going to Germany, all I can hope for is for a safe future for Sara and my other children. I wish they will be able to lead a normal life in peace and of course, to continue their education. All Yazidis wear a bracelet made of red and white thread, a talisman to protect them from the sun, disease and the evil spirits – a wide spread tradition in Greece and the Balkans, as well. When the bracelet falls off our wrists, we make a wish, says Sara as she waves goodbye before boarding the flight to Munich and a new beginning.

My daughter is deaf but her disease can be cured. We couldnt get a surgery in Afghanistan, so we took her to Iran. However, the amount we needed for the operation was unaffordable. Life of Afghans in Iran is not always easy, so we decided to leave for Turkey. We had gathered all our belongings and savings fort his journey. But there was no place for us in Turkey. So we decided to move on to Europe, and by asking around, a smuggler accepted to take us to Greece. The smuggler in Turkey told us to put all our belongings in a backpack and in a bag so it would not get wet. But the boat was overloaded so he threw our bag in the sea. By throwing this bag, we had just lost everything we had. My children dont even have clothes to wear anymore. Now we are stuck in Moria camp on a Lesbos Island, without a tent, and we havent even eaten since we arrived here two days ago. We only have this black net to protect us from.I dont know what. Meanwhile, my husband is trying to find a job so we can travel on to Athens. From there, Im not sure where we will go… I am afraid of what is going to happen to us, and I am worried about my children.
856	Sarah	Algeria	France	A	E	far	3368	38959	H	im	female	"I started boxing at the age of 14 but without really planning it. My mom was eager to engage me in physical activities outside of school because she believes in the educational value of sports. I went to inquire at the boxing hall in my city thinking they had classes for different sports, but they only offered boxing classes. I was tempted into taking a trial class and I really liked it; the ambiance, the game, the strategy, so I continued. When I started boxing women were still not allowed to compete in France. We could practice but we werent able to participate in competitions. Since then, female boxing has really developed. The French Boxing Federation has created a womens team and has put systems in place that allow us to reach the highest levels in this sport. I hope to be an example of courage and determination for aspiring athletes. Reaching an elite level in sports requires a lot of personal investment and courage and a strong support network. You need to have role models; sports stars that you can identify with and who can help you find your calling. I would be very happy if my journey in boxing could help encourage young athletes to follow their own paths to success. I would be thrilled to support athletic programmes for migrants and children of migrants. Its always a pleasure for me to share my passion for boxing and to teach the values we find in sports."

I thought I knew a lot about living in London, I had gone there on holiday, thought it was fantastic and then it turned out I had quite a distorted image. It was very difficult to meet people because of my working conditions. I returned to Brussels a year and a half later on the verge of depression. I went back to Brussels, and through work, I was sent to missions all over the world and I particularly liked South America, where I was finally granted a fixed position in Colombia. I fully realized I was going to a different continent where I didnt know anyone when I was on the plane with my two suitcases. I was leaving behind my family, a well-structured life with a lot of friends, a really nice social network, the coziness of my flat, and my day to day life and habits. When I got there, it felt like a smack in the face. Security wise it was very difficult for a single woman. You are advised to be extremely careful when using taxis, public transport, or walk alone when its dark, but its dark at 6 pm every single night of the year. The air pollution and the constant buzz is exhausting. But then one day, you notice that not everything must be negative. You become fascinated by the warmth of the people, the music, the colour, the exotic food, the art and culture of an amazing country. I realized that whenever you move to a new country, you have to change your mindset. You have to shift it in such a way that youre only looking at the positive things. I feel that every time you move, especially in my field, you will always miss something from before. So you have to constantly look forward and make the most of the new place youre living in. Of all the places Sarah has lived, she calls Brussels and Tenerife in the Canary Islands home. Those are two places where I can land blindfolded; smell the air and say Yes, Im home Home is really what you make of it, the places and the people you surround yourself with, the friends that become your family, the network that you create. At the end of the day, home is what you build around you."
858	Sarah	Canada	United Kingdom	N	E	far	43560	40718	E	im	female	I lived and worked in the UK for 11.5 years via 3 visas and naturalization. I created a job post before I left. I was born in Canada and had dual Canadian and American citizenship. After graduation from university, I moved to the US and worked in museums for 7 years. When I was offered the chance to move to London and work in a job that involved traveling to Africa to help increase records management capacity in governments, I leapt at it. Contrary to popular belief, most Canadians do not have English heritage and we do not get a free pass to live and work in the UK. I did not find out about (or perhaps they did not exist) working holiday visas until after I was no longer eligible by age. A long time Anglophile, I had always wanted to live in London, but I never expected to be able to do so. I stayed in the job that sponsored by original visa for 3 years and then returned to museum work by applying for what was then called a Highly Skilled Migrant Worker visa. After I had been in the country for 5 years, I applied for residency and then a year later for citizenship. I was lucky enough to have the points, (no MBA for me!), the salary level and the funds required for those applications. My first UK museum job was supported by grant funds that I helped to extend. The economic downturn meant that the public arts sector took a big hit. I was able to make a business case for a post that I then applied for and was offered after an open competition. I am very proud that although I later chose to leave the UK after over a decade there, I created a job post that adds value to the economy and may be filled by a non-immigrant or another immigrant. Without my immigration to the UK that job post would not exist. I am not the only immigrant to add value and contribute to the economy. In fact, it is the norm.
859	Sarah	South Sudan	South Sudan	A	A	close	1421	1421	E	hc	female	Sitting on a bed within a dilapidated church compound, Sarah is among the many former residents of the Malakal UN Protection of Civillians (PoC) site, who have moved back to Malakal town following ethnic fighting within the PoC. Like Sarah, nearly all the ethnic Dinkas have since left the PoC. Originally from Malakal Town, Sarah and her husband were farmers within the town where they grew an assortment of crops to sell in the local marketplace. My husband had a large plot of land where he would grow his crops while I had my own private garden at the house to feed my family. As soon as the war reached Malakal town in 2013 she fled with her family of eight to the UN PoC where they sought shelter. One day, an opportunity came for Sarah and her family escape to Juba through a chartered flight offered by a local oil company. The flight would require her and her family to travel out to the far away town of Paloich. Unfortunately for Sarah, she had lost her leg in 1995 in a car accident north of Khartoum and has been disabled since. Unable to make the long trek up to Paloich she made the difficult decision to stay behind, while her husband took their 6 children to Juba in hopes of a better life. It was a painful choice to make but I could not stop them because of me. I want my children to have a chance at having an education. I told them that I would be fine staying in the PoC where I would be looked after hoping that it would make them feel better about going. All that changed in late February following the ethnic clashes between rivalling groups. Being a member of the group largely believed to be responsible for the attack, Sarah had no choice but to leave, fearing revenge attacks on her. Now seeking refuge in the town, Sarah does not have access to the same level of assistance as she would normally get within the PoC. I still get in contact with my family regularly but they are also struggling in Juba. When you are outside of the PoC you have to pay for everything with money we often dont have. They are starting to contemplate on whether they want to come back to Malakal. It is difficult to make ends meet in Juba as well as in Malakal but at least they will be with me.

Back then I was young, 32 years old, and I was going to Greece to find a job and support my family financially. I had a good life in India, a decent job, a sufficient income. But my siblings were in a difficult position, so I decided to come to Greece and help them by sending them money. I was one of the best electricians in Athens and I was making good money. Things were different back then, since there were better job conditions. I worked really hard, I built a lot of houses, I made Greek friends and as a result, I managed to support my family. However, my family was far away. My initial plan was to stay in Greece for a short period of time, but since my family's needs were increasing, I ended up staying for more than 30 years. Earlier in 2018, I started thinking of my wife, our children, our dog, our jokes. A few months into the year, I had an accident and I was hospitalized in the public hospital of Herakleio, a big city on the island of Crete. I was feeling really weak and I was afraid for my life. So, I decided to return to my family. IOM, the UN Migration Agency, took care of everything. They issued my travel documents, and I had a special escort from Crete to India. Thanks to their Reintegration Assistance I will be able to do all necessary medical exams on time. IOM not only gave me the opportunity to see my family again, but I also managed to enhance my fragile medical situation. A new life has just started for me.

We arrived on the island of Samos and soon, we ended up at the northern frontier, at the makeshift camp of Idomeni. We spent three months there, it was really hard, we have really bad memories. Afterwards, we came to Athens, where we are until today. My family is from Deir ez-Zor, a beautiful city on the shores of the Euphrates River. I used to work at the city planning bureau. When I lost my husband to the war, I took the decision to get my children out of Syria. Weve been through unbelievable hardships since the day the war broke. We constantly changed cities, schools, friends, life and communities. We spent six years living like this. Now, all I want is to forget, to leave everything behind. The most important thing for me is the future of my children, after all, I left for their sake. My daughters are 16 and 18 years old and my son is 11. He is very keen on getting back to school. In Syria, he attended until the 5th grade and he got the chance to continue here at the Greek school for a while. And now the time has come to move to Croatia. Although my mother and my sister are permanent US residents, we were looking to settle to Switzerland, but it was not meant to be. At first, there were rumors that Croatia is not good for us, but then my brother reassured me that its a beautiful country and a very popular tourist destination, visited by people from all over the world. So, were happy to go there. I didnt expect to survive the war but life goes on, in the end. Now, we only wish to live like normal people, to enjoy our lives.

Guatemala welcomed us well, its a lovely country. But there was a bad period when we had to live in hotels for long stretches and there were critical days where we almost had to sleep in the street. We didnt have to do that thanks to the help of an Argentinian-Guatemalan womens association, reflects Sebastian. Every beginning is hard and ours was no exception, he continues. The challenges that his family faced were beaten with creativity, and by looking back at their Argentinian roots: We had to find means to survive so we took the decision to do it through our culture. Thats how, by selling empanadas, we started developing a business in Antigua Guatemala, where we lived. Guatemala welcomed him, helped his familys business thrive: I was able to study, something that would have been very difficult to do in my home country, said Sebastian. Now he has his own family in Guatemala, with a daughter. His experiences as a teenager provided him with a different vision of the world that has come in handy in his work, as he knows first-hand the challenges that children face when they migrate: Thats why I am very happy to be working for children migrating around Central America.
863	Sebastián	Honduras	Guatemala	L	L	close	2406	4332	E	im	male	"I realized that I no longer wanted to be part of the advertising industry in Honduras; I felt that to learn new things, I needed to go to new places. So I began formalities to leave for Canada; I had no concrete plans of what I was going to do once I got there. While working with an advertising agency in my birth country, I was constantly visiting different cities in Guatemala. I met several people and managed to establish many contacts, whom later opened the doors for me to settle in the Guatemalan capital. Before migrating to Guatemala I analyzed many issues: its advertising industry, the job opportunity the agency offered me, and the general context of the country. I thought it was an opportunity I could not miss. Unlike leaving for Canada, I would not be entering an adventure without knowing what to do, but rather I defined a plan for my professional growth. Although it is true that in Honduras there is a high climate of violence and unemployment, that wasnt the reason why I left the country. Instead, I was determined that if I ever wanted to worked in advertising again, Id do it from another country and with a more demanding challenge. A few days later, that opportunity knocked on my door. It was intimidating to think of the high competitiveness and talent that prevails in the advertising industry in Guatemala. The foreign community that has invaded this area compels me to try harder and to open my path competing against many others who also strive to excel. This multicultural platform has helped me grow even more than what I might have in Honduras. There is a high population of foreign nationals in Guatemala, especially in the advertising area. As people we always try to click with others. It was easy to establish that relationship with the chapines, because we are Central American brothers. On the other hand, I also found it easy to establish relationships with other foreigners, because they were going - or had gone - under the same settlement process I'm going through. Settling in a different country is not a decision you make lightly. Yes it's an adventure, but also a responsibility. Living in another country makes you part of it; you pay taxes, take part of the city´s development, you crop opportunities in its land, obey its laws. You have to respect where you are and those around you. You have to learn its history, its geography, learn about their culture and commit to the future of that country. In my new community I contribute with my job. Im part of the young force labor that drives the development of the local and national economy. I believe that whether youre working your dream job or not, young people must have a flame burning inside them, wanting to work and achieve personal and professional growth."
864	Sebastián	Paraguay	Paraguay	L	L	close	4950	4950	E	hc	male	Born in the district of Quyquyhó in Paraguarí state, Paraguay, Sebastián Leytte always wanted to find new horizons and grow. When I was young, Paraguay was always on my mind. I longed to know the capital of the country. So, at age fifteen, I got on a truck right to Asunción looking forward to studying and working. We were eleven siblings home and, being in Asunción was how I could help support that home, says Sebastian who did so for 25 years. During his staying in the capital, he joined the army and then he started to work in a hospital doing anything he could: he was a stretcher bearer, telephone operator, and also worked in a laboratory. I was never out of work, I can´t complain. However, my income was not enough so I decided to go to Buenos Aires. A city so many migrants went to during the twentieth century, looking to improve their life conditions and that of their loved ones. I started my journey on April 13 in 1962, on the famous Carlos Antonio Lopez train from Asunción to the city of Posadas where we got on another train to Buenos Aires. It took us three days to arrive there, but it didnt matter. When I travel, I feel such a joy and wariness for the unknown awaiting us. I feel excitement when searching for new horizons. But not everything was easy when he arrived in Buenos Aires. Sebastian, as many migrants at the time, arrived in the city without a stable job and documents for a legal stay, which pushed him to accept whatever job he was offered. I slept on the floor on a corner of a friends house because I didnt even have a bed. A month and a half after his arrival in Argentina he got a job in a carpenter´s shop where he found stability and worked as a carpenter for 14 years. It was during that time when, thanks to an amnesty granted by the government of Argentina, he got his Argentine residence and his citizenship. From the bottom of my heart, I can say that Argentina is my second country. In 1972, Sebastián married Selva Caballero with whom he still shares a home in the city of Capiatá, Paraguay. After getting married, they lived for three years in Buenos Aires and then, invited by his wife´s brother, returned to Paraguay due to the boom of a great hydro-electric power plant construction requiring a lot of workers, including experienced carpenters like Sebastián. His three-year work period there between 1977 and 1980 allowed him to buy a piece of land and build the house he still lives in today. In 1986, when he was 25 years old, Sebastián went back to Argentina due to change in legal currency. He worked for six months as a manufacturer of lift gates. Over the next few years he went back and forth between Paraguay and Argentina looking for better work. In 1992 Sebastián decided to try luck for the last time. I always pay attention to the news and by that time, the economy in Argentina dollarized and I thought it was my best chance to make earnings for my home. He returned to the capital, Buenos Aires. He felt homesick, and it was hard to find enough income, but he stayed a final three months before finally setting up in Asunción where he worked for another twenty years more until his retirement at age 68, in 2006. Thanks to the Multilateral Agreement on Social Security between Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, Sebastián got his retirement which could be estimated proportional to the time worked and the social security contributions made in each country where he worked.
865	Seda	Turkey	United Kingdom	M	E	far	8538	40718	E	im	female	Seda came to the UK in 2002 to improve her proficiency in English. I mostly struggled with cultural differences. My inexperience and lack of appreciation in different ways that people behave puzzled me for quite a while. In time I got used to having milk in tea, obsessing about recycling, and endlessly talking about the weather. I am proud of who I am and where I come from. Looking at what I have achieved over the years in the UK, people have shown me respect as well. They see me as a successful professional who has done it all while speaking a second language, living in different surroundings, and being part of a different culture. Like every single person who learnt English as a non-native, I struggled and got frustrated when I couldn't express myself. But thanks to the lovely people in my local Adult Education Centre, I found my voice eventually. Being a migrant in the UK has taught me to be strong when circumstances are less than ideal. Living here has shown me that the ways some people do things are not necessarily the only way of doing it. And that means learning to adapt. Migration means different things to different people. Depending on their circumstances, people are just trying to make life work for them in the way they hope to live it.
866	Sediq	Afghanistan	Japan	I	I	close	508	39990	H	im	male	"Sediq is from Mazar e Sharif, Afghanistan, and moved with his family to Kabul in 2010. A medical doctor by training, he had been working for the UN and other international organizations when he decided to apply for a scholarship to continue his medical studies. In 2014, after a long application process, Sediq received a scholarship to study public health in Kyoto, Japan. Although he had never lived outside Afghanistan before, Sediq was excited about the move. Id been interested in Japan for a long time – the Japanese culture, the Japanese attitude towards work. Japan in general has a good reputation in Afghanistan. Upon arriving in Japan, Sediq was struck by how different Kyoto was than what he had expected. Japan is a developed country, one of the top three economies in the world. I thought there would be 50, 100-story buildings! But Kyoto wasnt the way I thought it would be; its a beautiful old city with a lot of temples and historic sites. The cherry blossoms, clean air and relaxed lifestyle of Sediqs newly adopted city quickly won him over. Kyoto is a very beautiful city, I love it. Its my second home. Even now, I miss my small apartment and neighborhood, my classmates and professors. Sediqs family wasnt able to join him when he first arrived in Kyoto, so he had to adjust to life as a bachelor. This included cooking and cleaning for himself. I lived in a hostel with a lot of internationals. There was a shared kitchen, and it was very nice. Im not a good cook [laughs]. It was one of things I suffered a lot with! I had to adapt. It took me a month, but I slowly got better. Everywhere Sediq went in Japan, people were curious about his background and country. Likewise, when he visited home for the holidays, his family and friends had many questions about life in Japan. People hear about Afghanistan a lot – Afghanistan is on the news, whether its good or bad. When you say youre from Afghanistan, people are curious. They want to learn more about the real situation. When Im home visiting family, everywhere Im going people are interested in hearing about Japan. Especially about chopsticks! People ask, How can they eat with sticks! I brought a few pairs for my cousin as a gift. Sediq did not find Japanese culture too difficult to adapt to. In many ways, he says, it is similar to Afghan culture. However there were still things he missed at home. Japan is still part of Asia, and their culture is like ours. People are very respectful – the Japanese bow, and we put our hands on our hearts. They take their shoes off going inside peoples house, and we do the same. When they invite friends, we follow almost the same formalities. Traveling from ten or twenty poorest countries in the world to one of the most developed nations in the world, youre amazed with a lot of things. Yet you miss your friends, your family. You even miss the dust in Kabul! It takes time to be integrated in a different society. By seeing new parts of the world, Sediq believes, we get a new perspective that we can bring back to our home countries. I think its very necessary for us to travel and for us to see different people, different attitudes, different cultures, different ways of doing things. Its very important, especially in the particular situation of Afghanistan, to go outside and see other nations and come back. Almost 40 years of war has caused the country to suffer greatly, and people have kind of gotten used to that. They accept the abnormal as the normal. By going out, youre motivated again to not accept the way things are, but to change them."
867	Seiji	India	Libya	I	A	far	1931	4243	E	im	male	"I came to Libya in 2004. I work as a nurse supervisor; Im in charge of six sub-units under mine. It sounds like a lot, but I really enjoy this job and this service. My family moved with me here  two years after I began my stay. I have two daughters. They were only four and eight years old back then. Now, one of them is studying veterinary medicine. She likes pets a lot. The other one is still in high school. My husband is working here with me in the hospital. He works at the cafeteria. I believe in Gods will in my life. Its by his will that Im here, no matter the situation. That inlcudes the problems I am facing in work or the security situation in Libya. Its all by his will and this is why Im really enjoying my life. Back in 2014, my father died but I didnt go back. My mother is waiting for me, but I have not gone because of the ban on traveling to Libya from India. I believe, it's also because of Gods will. Whenever I deal with elder patients, I think of them as my own parents. I feel so happy when I help them. Im a bit different than others; my happiness really comes from my job. Since 2004, I have never taken leave or even sick leave. I come in before work starts and I finish everything in time. When I go home, I feel like Im dancing back to my place. This is my special happiness. I started studying nursing in 1992. I was on duty as student, when in 1993 I faced some personal difficulties. I fell down at the hospital and had a serious injury that took one year to heal. I was getting treatment and the doctors said I couldnt continue studying nursing, because I wasn't able to stand up for long periods. I saw my friends starting the new year, while I was still not healed. But one day, and its up to you to believe or not, I woke up completely healthy. This is my miracle in life, God healed me. For that, I decided to continue my studies. And for ten years, I worked in that same hospital. God can do everything in our lives. This is my destiny –Im here, able to walk, stand and work."

One time when I was three, I had asked him to bring me back a real life monkey, but he brought me a stuffed bunny he had bought for me during a transit at Zurich Airport. I took that bunny everywhere. When the war began, everything went so fast I could neither understand what was going on nor think about what I wanted to take with me when we fled. That's how I forgot my bunny when we left. My dad stayed behind, and I wrote him so many letters saying things like: Did you find my bunny? I miss you! I can't describe how I felt when I saw my father again three years later, in 1995. My whole body was trembling when I saw his face at the Airport in Zurich – and saw that he was holding my bunny.
869	Sekinat	Nigeria	Niger	A	A	close	2085	568	E	im	female	"I have four younger brothers and sisters, and a very sick mother. As the oldest, I feel its my responsibility to provide for my siblings. When a friend invited me to go to Libya, I thought I could try my luck as a fashion designer. This is what I studied back in Nigeria, but I never had money for a sewing machine. On our way there, I started blaming myself for choosing this road. I was told before I left that I was going to travel by plane. When we finally reached Agadez, I called my friend and told her that the road was terrible and that I couldnt do it anymore. She told me everything was going to be fine. When I saw that we were about to travel like goats, I finally understood that this how the whole journey was going to be. I called my mum and told her everything was fine; I didnt want to scare her. When we reached the desert, the driver dropped all forty of us there. We spent more than two weeks in the desert. We had nothing but milk. When they gave us water, it was petrol water; we had no choice but to drink it. People started getting very sick because of it. The driver finally came back and told us to get ready, but we had nothing to eat or drink and we were being told that there was still a week to go. We started our days with the sun on top of our heads and thats how we ended them. It was freezing cold at night and we had no blankets, nothing. One day, the driver dropped us off in another part of the desert and asked us for more money. I asked him how he expected us to have any money after two weeks in the middle of nowhere. He said he wouldnt take us unless we found the money. We started begging, telling him we wouldnt survive if he left us there. He finally took us up to the Libyan border. Thats when soldiers started shooting at the car; he told us to get out, and drove off with everything we had left. They dont care that you are a human being. They just abandon you there. The day the driver came to pick us up, I saw that I had been sleeping on a skeleton. It scared me to death. How could I had been sleeping on another human being?! Many of us died in the desert. You cant survive with any food or water. I have never seen anything like it: so many corpses in the desert, skeletons, fresh corpses. I am so grateful that I dont count myself among the dead. This road wasnt good for me, and its not good for anyone."
870	Sekou	Cote d'Ivoire	Italy	A	E	far	2318	31238	H	im	male	I am Ivorian, but I would rather define myself as a world citizen. After finishing my studies in Egypt, I started to work for the Ivorian Embassy in Rome until civil war broke out in 2002. After fifteen years of service, I left the diplomatic world and I got the refugee status. Now I work as radio speaker. Being a migrant is not always easy, especially for Africans. Considering Italys history of migration, Italians should be, above all, the first people to understand what being a migrant means. And yet, they often forget to try and put themselves in our shoes. For this reason, I promote intercultural projects at elementary schools. It is a great way to introduce little kids to the concept of cultural mixing and to make them understand that there is unspeakable beauty in the encounter of cultures.
871	Selena	Papua New Guinea	Papua New Guinea	I	I	close	2640	2640	E	hc	female	Selena is a local of one of the Carteret islands, a small cluster of islands located in the Pacific with a combined landmass of a little over 0.5km2. She was born on one of the tiny islands before moving to the nearby mainland where she did her studies. She was partway through her studies at the University of Technology in Lae when she was faced with the difficult decision to return home due to the fact that her family no longer had money to provide for her education. Despite having to return to her small island, life for Selena has been calm over the last several years. Life here on the island is so much simpler. Here, all we have to do is go fishing, harvest coconuts and other foods. Thats it. However, for Selena and many living on the Carteret islands, they are aware that this small pacific paradise will not last forever. The Carteret islands have been largely affected by climate change over the last several decades. In particular, the islands have been slowly shrinking due to costal erosion. When I was a little girl, this island was much bigger, the coast line stretched more than 20 meters into where the sea is today. Selena now lives with her grandchildren and husband on Heune – an island smaller than a football field. Originally, it was connected to a nearby island before costal erosion separated them in the 1960s. I knew that my home was shrinking and understood what was happening but many on the island did not. There were groups of people who came a long time ago to try and educate us on the greenhouse effect but many where still confused until IOM came and explained costal erosion to us. Many are afraid now that there wont be any more places for them to live. Some tell us we only have five more years left to live here and others have said as many as 10. Some people have already made the transition to the mainland including my children who live in the city of Buka. I know that when the day comes for us to move to the mainland that we will have to adapt. Life in the cities is different. Even life in rural areas on the mainland is different from here. Here, the land is very easy to grow fruits and vegetables on without much effort and difficulty. I had an aunt here who grew a banana tree a decade ago and it still stands today. Land on the mainland is much more difficult to grow food from. You must put much more hard work into getting the same results. As her home continues to get washed away in the sea, Selena knows that she will likely have to make the move in lifetime. We have to adapt, because we have no choice.
872	Selina	South Africa	Germany	A	E	far	5094	45909	H	im	female	My husband is from Berlin. We moved here in October 2014. Before that he stayed with me in Cape Town, but that wasnt really safe for him. Hes been mugged and it was not a good environment for him. As much as we loved Cape Town – there is just too much crime. So right after we got married, I decided, it was about time to move to Berlin. When I found out that I was pregnant we had to do everything really fast. I quit my job, packed and came to Germany. Its very nice here. It is interesting, but also very different. People here are not as warm as South Africans. But once you get to know them, you realise that they just take longer to open up to people. The seasons are extremely different, which is quite fascinating. I enjoy the contrast of the different seasons. But the winter, my goodness – its intense. It was very hard at the beginning, because you dont see the sun at all. But I loved my first experience with the snow. I literally stood on the balcony in my pyjama, like a child, to feel the snow touch my skin. I had left my whole family in South Africa. I havent had many friends, then I had my baby all before I had really settled in. Obviously my husband was there and his family, but being a mother here is very different. Getting the midwives and everything – that was good, but in South Africa you just dont have that. There you have your family and youre fine. The language isnt always easy. Germans really want you to learn their language and feel insulted if you dont. I completely understand, its their country and their language. But sometimes, I think they could be a bit more patient, with those of us who still learn German. I like Germany. Of course partly because my husband is here, but also the standard of living is way better. People here look after the environment, there is so many trees in the streets, and everything is nice and clean. And the recycling system - I love it. It makes me feel like such a good person! Selina and her little family are staying in Berlin for now. Because, as she says: Home is where your heart is.
873	Semhar	Eritrea	Germany	A	E	far	588	45909	H	im	female	My name is Semhar Abraham, I'm 27-years-old and from Kassel. I recently received my graduate degree in business law. My father is from Ethiopia and my mom is from Eritrea. In 1993 I arrived in Germany at the age of 5 and I have been living in Berlin for almost 5 years. When I think back to the time I first arrived in Germany, I mostly remember being very cold and that it was snowing. Home for me means family and friends. It's the place where I feel good, because I'm surrounded by people who love me. That's the case here in Germany, but also in the countries my parents come from. I have a set of coffee cups from Eritrea in my kitchen. In Eritrea, we have so called coffee ceremonies. You meet with your family or also with friends and spend time with each other, you talk and drink home roasted coffee from these cups. Here in Berlin, I drink an espresso from this cup almost every day. My grandparents were very important people for me. They are my role models, especially because they gave so much without ever demanding anything in return. They came to Germany as early as 30 years ago and then had the rest of the family join them. Back then, there was war in Ethiopia and Eritrea. That makes me a refugee child. Like the people now coming from Syria. I feel German, but at the same time also Ethiopian and Eritrean. The fact that you can see I'm from somewhere else sometimes causes problems. People don't treat you like a German, but like a migrant. However, those are isolated cases. Fortunately, I have rarely had bad experiences with racism. My philosophy is to ignore racist comments. I think you give them additional power if you pay too much attention to them.

It was the adventure that led me to Chad while I was in Libya trying to reach Europe. I am a public works engineer, but finding a job is a real problem, this is why I embarked on the journey that first brought me to Libya. Before the Arab Spring, I made my living easily in Libya without dreaming of going to Europe or arriving one day in Faya (Chad), since I worked with an Egyptian who treated me well. After the fall of Gaddafi, chaos ruptured; life was not the same anymore. I was kidnapped many times and shot 4 times; there everyone has a weapon even foreigners. Among the chaos, a Chadian told me that his uncle wanted to build a house. I thought that in Chad, the situation would be better, and I would be able to eventually go home; I was sick of the life I was living in Libya. We agreed on an amount of 5,653,000FCFA (USD 9,592) for a villa. Curiously, once we arrived in Faya things changed, and I paid the price. We have experienced suffering of all kinds and death threats. We have tried to contact the local authorities but to no avail. So I have to explain the situation to my friends. My only ambition is to go back to see my family. I lost everything and I will never start such an adventure again."

When I came to Ireland in 1997 it seemed like an old country, not a modern country. I saw old buildings and old houses, everything seemed very old and it reminded me of the 1980s in Romania. I didnt know much about Ireland when I came here first but I found the people supportive and helpful. If I was in a shop or a pub or the city centre you could ask for help people would point you in the right direction. I studied music in Romania and would have liked to study in the Royal Irish Academy of Music but my level of English was a barrier to entry at the time. But to be honest, from 2007 I found people started to become more and more prejudiced, and started to treat people differently than they had before. Around this time I began thinking about starting something to show the positive aspects of the Roma community and the Roma tradition. I wanted people to see past negative perceptions of the Roma people, and to show to the Irish that we are a positive people. When we opened Musicantia in 2013, we started the music school in Crosscare in Dublin and we had 35 students and 5 talented music teachers. The aim of Musicantia is to help young Roma and other young people to develop an interest in long-term education. It is our goal to encourage our students and young people to remain in full time education and avoid negative antisocial behaviours. I wanted to offer them the opportunity to interact with other communities through music and art, and attempt to break down cultural barriers while simultaneously combating the prejudice affecting Roma people. I no longer see myself as a migrant. I dont see myself moving again in the future to Romania or another country. This is my familys home and where my children are going to live, that is where Im going to live.

We hiked in the mountains for almost 18 hours over two nights. There was a lot of snow. Our smugglers told us to walk in the jungle at night. We would start at 5 PM and walk until 2-3 in the morning. What I miss most is when I was in school. I was able to learn and meet friends. It was a great time for me. I think education is freedom. All boys and girls have a right to education. Most girls in my hometown in Afghanistan only go to school till the age of 15. After that theyre married off. Im 15. Im afraid to go back there because of that. Drawing is therapeutic for me. I first started drawing when we got to Greece. I want to go to an open camp and draw buildings, but ultimately I hope to become a civil engineer and build things.
877	Seydou	Senegal	France	A	E	far	1458	38959	H	im	male	"After obtaining my high school diploma, I left Senegal to pursue geography studies in France. For me, Paris was the City of Light. I imagined the city while reading the great classics such as A Moveable feast by Hemingway or Notre-Dame de Paris by Hugo. I had such a romantic view of Paris; the reality was quite a shock when I first arrived! I am from Tambacounda, a city in the South-East of Senegal. It is one of the main cities of departure, from where thousands of migrants leave. My city lacks of infrastructures and work opportunities for the youth, and the temperature there rises up to 45°C.  People need to understand that living there is very difficult and that to build a future we need to leave, often begrudgingly. The remittances sent every month to those who stayed there allow them to survive. Migrants make my city. When I came to Paris, I had to start working immediately to fund my studies as I did not receive scholarship. I had to face discrimination in employment, ethnic profiling… But thanks to my education, and also because I paid attention never to be aggressive with people who were attacking me, people started looking at me in a more positive way. I think my attitude made people listen to me. At the end of the day, I feel at home here. I spent half of my life in France and my friends are here. My wife is French. Of course I miss from my country the human warmth, the sense of solidarity and sharing. When I go back to my country, I feel free. Being seen without any judgment, living without any social pressure, is a form of freedom. It feels good to melt into the crowd. If I had to read again the classics with the benefit of hindsight, I would definitively have a more critical eye."

He stands as head of the family, being the eldest of four siblings, after both his parents died. With few opportunities to work in his native village, he decided to migrate to Mauritania to take care of his family. He chose a village in the south east of the country, Bassiknou, where a large community of Malian migrants was already established. I have to admit, it was a leap of faith, Seydu said, I was young and I didnt know what to expect or if I would be strong enough. But I had to do it, he added. Seydu arrived in Bassinkou in 2011 with one dream: to open his own welding shop. I started doing small jobs here and there to scrape together the money to open my studio. I rented a room with no water, no electricity, for 15,000 Ouguiya a month (41 USD). It was not easy, but I was happy. I never felt the cold of loneliness because, since the beginning, locals treated me as one of them. Their secret is hospitality. Hospitality is a must here - like tea, three times a day! After two years of daily savings, he finally opened his own welding shop in 2013. He married a fellow Malian, Ibella, and they have two children. Seydu and his family have fully integrated in the local community. I am a lucky man, he said. He recently signed a contract with an international NGO operating in Bassiknou, which provides him with a steady income, allowing him to send money to relatives in Mali. My brothers and sisters have a house now in Mali, and our children will have a better future than us, he added, beaming with pride. I am doing well here. I would like to stay, at least until the political turmoil in my country calms down.

Soon after his arrival, Shabab realised that his dream of pursuing further studies and becoming financially stronger to support his family of six came with more complications than he had initially bargained for. Instead of attending university, Shabab found himself working as a newspaper distributor, often under exploitative conditions. Three years went by and the hope of building up a better life was fading by the day, until Shabab decided to take a decisive step and one which surely did not come easy: he decided to return to Pakistan. I saw my future being blocked there, which is why I started thinking about going back and starting everything from scratch, whether it be education or some business, whatever it is I want to do I wanted to do it in a proper and legal way. This is why I returned. In order to facilitate his reintegration in Pakistan, Shabab decided to participate in the RESTART' programme*. As the sole breadwinner of the family, it enabled Shabab to start a small textile shop in Lahore. He is currently earning enough to make ends meets and despite the many ups and downs that came with his migration experience, he is still hopeful that the future has bigger and better things in store for him. For the future I think this business is running well, and I will continue running it to support my family. I am thinking of getting further education, whether here or somewhere abroad, but this will take time, perhaps six months or a year. Lets see.   *Reintegration Assistance for Voluntary Returnees to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Russian Federation / the Chechen Republic project (co-funded by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund of the European Union). RESTART beneficiaries receive a EUR 500 cash grant and in-kind assistance of up to EUR 2,800 for pursuing income generating activities after their return.

881	Shadrach	Ghana	Mauritania	A	A	close	2206	1702	E	im	male	"There are migrants who escape war, and there are migrants who escape poverty. I am one of those, I saw poverty and I am fighting against it. This is how Shadrach explains why he left Ghana at the age of 27 to undertake the long journey that brought him to Mauritania. I do not want to survive, I want to live. That is why I left. I am a cobbler, I just need my needles and a bit more stuff and then I can do my work wherever I want. Shadrach first left Accra in 2001. He did not have a specific destination; he just wanted to find a place where to work and earn money to invest back in his country. I have to confess that I thought about reaching North Africa and then maybe Europe, but I never thought of crossing by boat; it is not worth it. For six years, he moved around West Africa and finally settled in Mauritania in 2007. Every time you enter a new country you don't know anybody, you have to find a place to sleep, a job, understand where things are and how they work. It is a big challenge. But if you have the chance to make a friend along the way, then everything becomes easier. In 2005, Shadrach met Aziz, a Ghanaian hairdresser. We shared the same ideas and the same wish for the future, so we decided to continue together. At the beginning of 2007, with enough money saved, they left for Saint Louis and from there, they crossed into Mauritania. Upon arrival Shadrach started to work as a garbage collector, but after a little while a friend offered him the possibility to work with him as a cobbler. They worked together for six months, until Shadrach found a job as housekeeper. I was really lucky. In Mauritania it is hard for foreigners to find a job. Each nationality has a special activity. Typically, Ghanaians and Nigerians are hairdressers, Malians are housekeepers, Senegalese wash cars and so on. So for me to find such a job was very fortunate. I got it thanks to a friend of mine who decided to return to Ghana and asked me if I wanted to replace him. This work has allowed me to put some money aside over the last eight years. I have been fighting for this capital for so many years in my life, now I finally have it. Whatever you do, its a matter of sacrifice. Your life depends on you, on how hard you work. If you make efforts at some point you get your reward."
882	Shafiq	Pakistan	Pakistan	I	I	close	1167	1167	E	hc	male	My name is Shafiq and I arrived in Greece from Pakistan in 2017. I worked for eight years at a gas station in Pakistan, but my income was very low, so I decided to leave for Europe. I ended up in Greece, hoping to earn enough to provide for my family in Pakistan. Despite finding work in the agriculture sector, my income was simply not enough to support my family and myself. I started to think more and more about my wife and our two children, so I decided to apply for IOMs Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration programme. Since I had experience working at a gas station, I asked IOM to assist me in setting up my own gas station upon my return to Pakistan. And my wish came true! Now I run my own business, and have purchased gas cylinders and air pumps. My income is around EUR 250 per month, which is enough to support my family. I am more than happy that I managed to return to my family. Being together with my family is the most important thing for me, leaving my home was the hardest decision I ever made. IOM helped me to leave behind all the hardships Ive been through and focus on my familys future. IOMs reintegration assistance is such an important support for those who decide to return to their homes and rebuild their lives.
883	Shahin	Iran	Hungary	M	E	far	11183	16129	E	im	male	I always say that Im a human from earth and my religion is humanity. I was a religious political activist in Iran, about to be executed for leaving Islam. While I fled from jail and death back home, I was also arrested when I arrived at the border between Romania and Hungary. I like Budapest. The people are nice and the weather is perfect. Finding a job is difficult though. You dont get any support, but people expect you to live and act as if youve always been here. Refugees are like newborn babies. You have to start over completely - learning to live in a new culture and abide by new rules. Its really important to learn to speak Hungarian, but most refugees dont have the time and support to learn it. While life is usually hard, for refugees its even harder. I miss my parents back home, but we stay in touch a lot, almost every day. The biggest challenge for refugees I think is finding a job and having enough money to sustain yourself. Luckily, I have a lot of experience with different things. Im a social behaviour analyst, so seeing how people interact from culture to culture is very interesting for me. I try to use my abilities as best I can to move forward. Im working toward becoming an official translator right now, but have many other plans as well. One of them is to open a restaurant. I think I can connect easily with people from different cultures and one of the things that connect people really well is eating! It creates a bridge between people unlike much else. Ive noticed Hungarians like sweets. I want to produce Persian cookies. Im sure everything will be okay, but I have to take things one step at a time. I have much to learn before I can do all of this.

We fled to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and things were very hard in the beginning. We had nothing and no one to rely on. Thank God people were very welcoming and supported us a lot. I have no academic degree, and when we first came to Erbil I immediately looked for work, but couldnt find any because of my lack of education. When my friend Gula asked me to join her, along with four other women, to start a bakery, I immediately said yes. We opened the bakery in August 2016; it felt like coming alive again after being dead. We thank God that the business is doing very well and we have been successful. We have so many customers coming to purchase our traditional bread that we had to bring in our family members to work with us. I am so happy to have a full-time job so that I can support my family, including my father and mother who are old and cannot work. I rented a house in Shaqlawa and started a new life here. Of course, it was difficult to lose everything we had back in Fallujah, but I was determined to get back on my feet despite our circumstances. Working is honorable and crying wouldnt get me anywhere. Thanks to this project, I can pay the rent and take care our daily needs. I ask my mother about what she needs, plus I can buy clothes for my children and make them smile. I have suffered a lot in my life and I dont want my children to see what I saw. They are very young! I will work hard so that they have a better life than I had. I also pay for my fathers medications. I would like to thank IOM, they truly saved my life. I was under huge psychological pressure and on the brink of total collapse. But thank God, IOM gave me new hope. I would also like to call on all the women who were forcibly displaced and tell them not to lose hope, and to keep searching for opportunities because there is always a way out from suffering."
885	Shakeel	Pakistan	Greece	I	E	far	1167	18117	H	im	male	Back in 2010, I decided to leave Pakistan and come to Greece. I wasnt unemployed or anything, but the smugglers managed to convince me that in Greece Id make a fortune in a couple of years time. Silly me, I fell for that and I embarked on my journey to Europe. The trip was far from easy. I would walk all night long and hide during the day. At the borders between Iran and Turkey, I got captured by some people who demanded €5,000 to let me go. Of course, I didnt have that much money with me and I wouldnt be able to find it even if I could ask for money from all my family and friends in Pakistan. So, one day whenI was alone in the room, I jumped from the 3rd floor of the building where they held me. I was saved. In total, it took me 25 days to complete the journey. I crossed the river Evros at the Greek-Turkish border and I was finally on Greek soil. A few years ago, I was strolling on a mountain at Heraklion, on the island of Crete and I stumbled upon a crying little puppy. It was a new-born, probably abandoned there to die by someone who didnt want it. I took it home with me and I named him Mino. He could fit in a teacup, thats how small he was! A couple of elderly Germans, my neighbors at the village of Moires, helped me with Minos vaccines and other obligations. They are so nice, I love them very much. Since that day, Mino and I have been inseparable. I take him with me to work, we play together and we sleep together. He even looks after me when I fall ill. I love my Mino! Many of my compatriots, when they return home from Europe, they bring laptops, TV sets and other electronic devices with them. But I dont care about all that. I only want to take Mino home with me. I couldnt leave him behind after all that weve been through together. I am not returning to Pakistan without him. Ive told my children that I am bringing Mino with me and they are so excited! I cant wait to return to Pakistan and build him a new dog house.
886	Shakeel and Mazhar	Pakistan	Greece	I	E	far	1167	18117	H	im	male	Shakeel and Mazhar are two young men from Pakistan who, about a year ago, left their country in the hope of getting a good job in Europe so that they could support their families back home. I took a ship from Karachi to Iran and then I had to walk to Tehran. From there, I mostly walked my way to Turkey. It took me 17 days to get to the island of Kos in Greece. It felt like forever, explains Mazhar, who left behind a 4-year-old daughter. Shakeel, from Lahore, had a similar journey. I was happy to get here but it was impossible to get a job, no matter how hard I tried, he adds. Mazhar was luckier, or at least thats what he thought. I got to work in the fields of Skala Lakonias (in the southern Peloponnese) but I never got paid for my labour. I ended up in Athens, I spent 3 months in the streets, homeless.Both men, with no job or place to stay, got increasingly desperate as they felt stranded in Greece with no means to go back home, until some of their compatriots talked to them about The implementation of Assisted Voluntary Return including Reintegration Measures (AVRR) of the IOM. Shakeel places his hand on his heart as he enthusiastically says Im so happy Im going back home, I can hardly wait! Thanks to the help of the IOM, not only I will be able to go back to my son in Pakistan but I will also get the financial aid to start a small farm. Both Shakeel and Mazhar are beneficiaries of the personalized reintegration plans, which are based on their specific needs. With the help of the reintegration programme, I will buy two cows together with my brother, says Mazhar, and hopefully, I will be able also to work as a boat builder, just like I used to do before coming to Europe.
887	Shakirat	Nigeria	Niger	A	A	close	2085	568	E	im	female	"I left Nigeria with a man I knew from back home. I didnt know him that well, but because I couldnt find a job back home I decided to follow him. I needed to survive; I needed to fend for myself. No one else was going to do it for me. When we left, I had no idea where we were going. When we reached Arlit in Niger, I couldnt find any work other than prostitution. Sometimes I made up to 20,000 CFA in a day, other times I didnt make anything. I had to give the brothel owner all the money I made. If I didnt make enough, she wouldnt give me anything to eat. Even when I did, sometimes she thought I was lying to her and wouldnt feed me. A few times she threatened me with prison until I told her we would go to prison together if that was the case. At some point, I had to start keeping some money to myself because I would otherwise starve. I sent my family money a few times, but I had to make 90,000 CFA per month just to cover the rent. With every passing month I was in more and more debt. I suffered tremendously. Sometimes people would have sex with me and pretend they werent satisfied so they would ask for their money back. Other women would give it back and advised me to do the same. I know its only 2,000 CFA, but that was hard-earned money for me. Once I refused to give it back, and the man beat me up and destroyed our room. We were 6 women sharing the same room. Not only did we hear each other, but we saw each other in the act all the time. Never in my life did I picture myself doing anything like this. I thought I would be working in a shop or as a maid. Had I known that this what was waiting for me on this route, I would have stayed home. I stayed in the brothel in Arlit for the next 8 months. Initially, I wanted to continue the journey, but once I heard about how terrible the route was I decided to go back. However, I didnt have any money for transportation. A police officer told me about IOM so I went to the transit centre and they helped me get to Agadez. We are very poor, but I am extremely happy to go back and see my child. My father is dead and so is my husband. My child needs me there. I like to think this experience has made me wiser. The more you live, the more you learn. However, I wouldnt wish this kind of suffering upon anyone, not even my worst enemy."
888	Shalu	India	India	I	I	close	1931	1931	E	hc	female	When I was 11 months old my parents divorced and I stayed with my father. I did not know where my mum was until I was 25 years old. I married for choice and I went to live with my husbands family. I got pregnant and I had a daughter but my husband and his family were not happy about it. They wanted a boy, and they started treating  me very badly. I then lost my second child. When I was pregnant for the third time my mum had found out that I was not safe and she contacted me. She was living in Norway and she wanted me to visit her but I was too ahead on my pregnancy and I could not travel, so I waited until delivery and then went to Norway with a tourist visa. In Norway I felt at home, my mother was there and there were also other relatives. I noticed that while in India people would have always found the time to chat, in Norway everybody seemed busy. However, they were happy. When my visa expired I applied for a refugee visa as both my daughters lives and my own one were at risk and I wanted to settle in Norway. However when my husband and his family were asked clarifications, they said they were waiting for our retour and they loved us very much. My request for a refugee visa was denied and I had to return to India. However I did not go back to my husband. IOM helped and supported me a lot: when I came back to India I did not even had food to eat. I studied, took a computer course and purchased a taxi. I am now taking driving classes to get a licence and I opened a tailoring unit. My dream is to continue my studies and make a brand with my tailoring products. I would like to give to the brand my mothers name and export my products abroad. I also already paid more than 90% of my own house thanks to IOM, my step fathers friend and my own savings, so now I am already saving money for my start up business in tailoring.
889	Shamshad	Afghanistan	Afghanistan	I	I	close	508	508	E	hc	male	Shamshad returned to Afghanistan in 2011. He initially left in 2008, when the security problems in his home province of Ghazni worsened, the then 17-year old decided to migrate to Europe with his older brother. After working in Iran for some time, we had made enough to pay a smuggler to take us to Greece. There, we again stayed for a few months to save up for the smuggling fee from Greece to Europe. Life in Greece as an irregular migrant worker wasnt bad, Shamshad recalled, but then one night, his brother was arrested by the police. He was brought to a detention centre and when I tried to find out what happened to my brother, they told me that he had committed suicide while in detention. I just dont believe that, I am sure the authorities lied to me, something must have happened to my brother while in detention, he said firmly. After that incident, he was determined to reach Europe as quickly as possible. He eventually made it to Norway but once there, he realized life wasnt what he had expected. Despite what the smugglers had told him, it wasnt easy at all to be granted asylum. After waiting for 1.5 years for a decision on his case, he was rejected twice and decided to return voluntarily to Afghanistan. With the help of IOM, I set up a shop to sell used parts for cars and motorcycles. I literally returned with nothing, and given the bad security situation in Ghazni, I also couldnt return home. If IOM hadnt helped me to set up a shop in Herat (a rather secure province at that time) I wouldnt have known what to do, said Shamshad. He is married now, and a father of two young children aged three and two. Although it isnt always easy to make ends meet due to the worsening security situation, he has no desire migrate again: If there is no specific threat on my life or the life of my family members, I will never migrate irregularly again. It just is such a huge waste of time and resources. He now hopes that IOM can support him with a small cash grant so that he can further expand his shop and improve his economic situation.
890	Shania	Afghanistan	United States	I	N	far	508	63123	H	im	female	In 1979, a war erupted in Afghanistan as the Soviet Union began fighting against resistance groups. Grassroots armies known as the Mujahideen had formed as the Afghans tried to claim their religious rights. They were supported by national and international aid from neighboring countries. Afghan civilians, afraid of the violence, started fleeing the country as refugees.   I was only three years old when my parents were put in a refugee detention center in the United States.  Rather than moving to a family facility in Texas, my parents left me with family that had already made it safely to America. I was too young to remember the process, but I have been told that it took a lot of time and it was hard because we didnt know what was happening. I know there were a lot of background checks, which were difficult and time consuming but necessary as a prevention mechanism. Im glad government reports show the attention to detail involved because I think thats the point: to make sure everyone feels safe.   I do remember feeling confused for a long time- not knowing when we would finally be safe. The first few months were challenging for my parents. They werent able to be with me and they had to answer a lot of questions in front of a lot of people over and over. I dont think people understood that they needed help: a place to live, a way to support themselves and their young child, or that they were scared. They needed hope. They went from one chaotic and scary experience to another.   This has affected me my entire life - I chose to devote my professional life to helping others. I volunteered and worked at shelters and crisis centers in high school and college, worked for child welfare systems and foster care providers, and with the federal government to help people get settled. Its hard being a refugee and an immigrant because there are mixed emotions - you feel lucky for being safe and having all of these opportunities, but you also experience rejection and discrimination. It has forced me to reevaluate my culture and identity. Sharing my story helps me balance my American upbringing with the positive parts of my diverse background.   This interview was conducted by Kynat Akram in Washington, DC. It is part of No Lost Generation-GW (NLG-GW), supported by the US Department of State, a student-led initiative to help those affected by the ongoing Syrian refugee crises which aims to shatter preconceived ideas and negative stereotypes.

I stayed here because my three children needed to go to school, and I didnt have anyone who could take care of them so I had to keep working here. But when the tsunami hit Sri Lanka ten years ago, it destroyed my house and I had to buy everything again. I havent been able to return home and see my family for six years now. Im 56 years old and Ive lived in Kuwait longer than I have in my own country. I started having sight problems a few years ago. As I could not see well, I couldnt work anymore. My sponsor didnt renew my contract, so I didnt have a residency permit anymore and could not afford a doctor. I went to my embassy, and they referred me to a shelter. The ladies working there helped me with everything. They were able to get me an eye transplant for one eye and a new lens for the other. And now I can see! Im planning to go back to Sri Lanka soon. Im really excited to see my grandchildren for the first time—not just to meet or hear them, but to actually see them!   Shanika was able to seek assistance and reside in a shelter run by the Government of Kuwait.
892	Sharon	Peru	Argentina	L	L	close	6163	8476	E	im	female	"July 1994, sometime at noon. I am with my older sister, Vane, and my cousin Angelita in the alley that faces my grandparents house in Cusco, Peru. That day, my parents, my sister and I moved to live in a small city in Ecuador called Riobamba. I was three years old, almost four, and Vane was 5. I wonder if any of us understood what was happening. The only thing I remember about that day is a scent. Vane and I had these little woven purses. I do not know if they were bought for the trip or not, but we carried them during our exodus. Those purses had a particular smell, a mix of strong odors: cookies, dirt, butter and dark flowers. It was not a sour scent, neither bitter. When, in Ecuador, I smelled those little purses I thought they smelled like Peru. Vane does remember. She tells me she knew what was happening and did not want to leave, because she did not want to move away from mama Hebe, our maternal grandmother. My sister always had a special connection with her. I guess because she is the first granddaughter. Or maybe because, although they are very different in many aspects, they feel like two of the same essence. Neither of them goes through life yelling; their voices fill with sugar when talking to strangers and seen them curse is beyond comic. It was different for my parents. They not only left family behind, but also friends. I do not usually think about what they felt that day, the few days we spent in Lima and Quito before going to Riobamba, or their first days there. Being Peruvian and living in Ecuador is something that, since I have memory, has been a reality in my life; like the fact that I use glasses or my curly hair. That is why I never thought there was a change. I never reacted to the fact that there was a day zero and maybe my parents remember it differently. In my house we barely have three photo albums. It seems my parents were not that fond of photography or enthusiastic about going to the studio to reveal photos. But that made the photos we do have become treasures. There are photos from life before Ecuador: their engagement party, my mothers bachelorette party, my parents marriage, and our first birthdays. Others of the first years in Riobamba: Alejandra, the third daughter or the Ecuadorian, one or another birthday and school events, travels inside the country and pictures with friends. The albums reveal the dichotomy of my life and my sisters: our family is Peru and in Ecuador, our friends. Migrants. I never thought of us that way. I associated the term with travelers who had a bad time in the host country, those who go through cold, loneliness, hunger and discrimination. Now I know we are migrants and that we were lucky, because we travelled in good conditions. My father had a job; in fact, that was the reason why we left. It offered benefits, like annual round-trip tickets to Peru for all the family. And, nevertheless, we were excited the few times we talked to them by phone. It was an event of colossal proportions. We all gathered around the phone and remained silent while one of us was talking. Until now I remember the emotion in my parents voice, that yelled when speaking, and my shy voice when it was my turn. Someone always cried, mama Flor or my mother. And there was always the big void that forged as soon as we hung up because, even though my fathers job was great and our house pretty, for a moment after we hung up, we were alone. Twenty-four years later were still in Ecuador, and from that loneliness there is only sadness left when we look at the pictures where we are missing. I am a daughter of migration, because the only way of living I know is by missing. In Ecuador I miss my family from Peru, and in Peru I miss my friends from Ecuador. I dream of having everything in the same place, so I can have lunch with my grandparents and dinner with my best friend on the same day. I wonder, how it would be like to present a boyfriend to my grandmother, or the relationship between my cousins and my friends, or hug an uncle for Fathers Day? Nevertheless, what I gained was two ways of understanding Spanish. To use farrear and tonear to refer to the same activity. Pronounce achachay in Kichwa or alalau in Quechua to say that it is cold. In my house Lomo saltado and seco de pollo are cooked, and Eva Ayllón and Paulina Tamayo are listened to. But sometimes being from two places may feel like you are not from any. In Ecuador I am the Peruvian, and in Peru the Ecuadorian; in any other country I am many, sometimes Ecuadorian, others Peruvian, and sometimes the long a rehearsed I was born in Peru but lived all my life in Ecuador. And even though some impertinent nationalists and well-intended nosey people keep asking which country I would pick, they will always be for me Peru and Ecuador, Ecuador and Peru, in the same proportion, my homes."
893	Shereen	Syrian Arab Republic	Estonia	M	E	far	890	23106	H	im	female	My husband Mustafa and I are from the Daria region in Syria, which suffered first from the war. We decided to go away from this region, moving from place to place within Syria. For 14 years before the war, I worked with orphans and Mustafa was studying. Because of this, he did not need to be part of the military. Soon the law changed. Whether he was a student or not, he was forced to be part of the military action. We saw over 3,000 people die in one day. This was hard, especially for our son. We left Syria and went to Lebanon. We tried to start our life there. There were many barriers that prohibited us from working. In the work place, it didnt matter whether we were there legally or illegally — because we are Syrians, the locals could come to our work any moment, take us outside and say we had to stop. Our son also suffered injustice at school. It was hard to get a residence permit. Lebanon wanted us to have a guarantor – a local resident, who could vouch for us in Lebanon. With no residence permit and most of our money lost, the Lebanese government put stamps in our passports that indicated we had to leave. That same evening, we left for Turkey. It was impossible to go back to Syria, it wasnt safe. We couldnt go to Egypt, where Mustafa has family, we werent welcome in Lebanon and we couldnt manage in Turkey. The pressure was great and the difficulties were real. We saw no other option but to go to Greece. There was no legal way to do so, smugglers were the only option. Life in Syria and this journey are different experiences. In Syria, we risked death or losing our child every day, this forced us to move. We began reading about Estonia to know more about this country, which now gives us hope and welcomes us. It is secure and quiet here. People are genuinely sympathetic. They understand what we have gone through. This is humbling and gives us hope that we can make it. From the expressions on the faces of some people, we see that they are worried about us being here. Once, when I was queuing at the bank, the cleaner started bothering me. I took some chocolate and gave a bit to my son and also to her. She started smiling and changed her attitude. Now, every time I now go outside, I take sweets with me. We hope our son succeeds in Estonia. We want to show our culture to the locals and learn more about theirs in turn. I am skilled at cooking tasty meals and making handcrafts. We hope to open a café. We have been helped and we want to give back to this society.
894	Shermane	Canada	Sri Lanka	N	I	far	43560	3768	L	im	female	Well. I can say that I moved for love. Once I finished my degree in my home country, Canada, I found myself at a crossroads. I had been in a long-distance relationship for two years with my boyfriend, who was born and raised in Sri Lanka.. I also wanted to figure out what to do after university. I felt I had the freedom to travel and would always have the option of coming back if I didnt like it. So, I took a big chance and moved to Sri Lanka! Since my parents are Sri Lankan, I used to visit quite often growing up. So luckily, I didnt feel much of a culture shock. Sri Lanka is an amazing place to live in terms of the weather, the culture and the food. The people are more relaxed – they work hard, but still somehow manage to find time to enjoy life – the island life. I do miss my parents and friends back in Canada. And I will admit, it took a while to get used to the way things work in Sri Lanka. I also didnt speak the language too well, but now I am quite good! I can easily navigate a ride in a tuk tuk! Though I initially moved for love, I found so many opportunities for myself. I found a great job and have gained amazing work experience. Ive really grown as a person too. All my life, I sought to understand my heritage and now I can say Ive truly found my identity. I discovered myself and a new home. The risk I took paid off. I am now married to the man I love! I had moved not knowing what to expect, but now I am happy to be here. It feels good to give back to my mother-country. It seems more people like me are coming back to Sri Lanka and this benefits everyone.

I decided to leave because I wanted to save my life and my family. Its really hard to talk about. Most of my friends are still stuck in a difficult situation in Afghanistan. I saved my life and the lives of my wife and my children but nothing can replace my original country. Its like your mother. Your mother cannot be replaced. I miss Afghanistan and I worry about what is going on there still. People are killed every day. I hope something will be changed. Now I live in Budapest with my family. I have refugee status which means I can be a permanent resident of Hungary for all my life. We were lucky because we got support from the Migration Service so we could start our simple life. I think migrants shouldnt rely on others to come out of their situations. If your life isnt safe you have to try to start a new life on your own. We did that. In the past 3 years my daughters learned Hungarian perfectly. They go to school and my wife works at a kindergarten. Were gradually integrating into society. Hungary is a nice country. Life is easy here. I really like the weather. Im a very emotional person, I dont like it when its always cloudy. When I came to Budapest and I was amazed by the old buildings. There are a lot of surprises everywhere, for every bridge, for every building, there is a very interesting history behind it. But there are some problems. Were a little bit different from other people and we feel some discrimination. But if people know you, that youre a normal person, their opinions can be changed very easily. There is a big issue with the Roma minority here. Peoples first reaction is that they assume that were Roma. And they show this. Its visible from their attitude that theyre not happy to see us. I knew about this issue before I came to Hungary and I used to be quite angry about this but after I moved here my opinion has changed and I can see that its a very difficult situation. Roma people are also sometimes hostile towards Hungarians. They have a dissagreement between each other and this can only be changed slowly. Its important to be polite and kind. This can change things so much. If you start speaking politely to someone that person can change even in just a few seconds. If you say bad things, naturally, you get back something bad. So do it for yourself. This is for your own benefit. I teach my children the same way. It doesnt matter where you come from I respect everyone as human beings.
896	Shireen	Egypt	United States	A	N	far	3609	63123	H	im	female	Growing up very poor in post-war Egypt, my fathers intellectual talent was his access to the United States, while for my mother – who got married to such a man – it was an adventure. My mother thought that it was going to be only a temporary stay until my father finishes his studies. When she came to the United States, my mother was able to have a little bit of freedom. Coming from a traditional Egyptian family, she had had almost no freedom under her father and her brothers watch. Being in a new and different place seemed exciting at that time. Nonethless, the initial years were very hard for her because she was here to be a companion for my father who was studying Economics and who was fluent in English. However, my mother didn't speak the language and was not able to work. It was very isolating. She got pregnant with me immediately after arriving here. It was a difficult pregnancy. She felt very vulnerable. I myself spent the earliest years of my life thinking we were going go back. As a little young child, I spoke Arabic first. I didn't speak English until later on. I remember sometimes looking out the window at the neighbors children playing and my mom would tell me that there was no point to go with them because we were supposed to go back. For a long time, I had the sense that I was not like them and that I wasn't at home. However, one day we figured out that we were going to stay here. We didnt have a long-term game plan or strategy. My parents initial strategy was then to assimilate and blend at all costs.
897	Shireen	Iran	Switzerland	M	E	far	11183	86919	H	im	female	I have been living in Switzerland for two years now. My family could only pay for my escape. Therefore, I am all alone here. It is very expensive to flee and my family wont be able to come to Switzerland. When I left home my father gave me a cell phone. This cell phone and the clothes I was wearing were the only things that I could take with me. My cell phone was the only way to get in contact with my family and to tell them that I have arrived well. It also gave me the feeling that I am not alone. It meant everything to me.
898	Shwe	Myanmar	Thailand	I	I	close	1292	7189	H	im	female	"My name, Shwe, means gold in Burmese. I was born in Mawlamyine State, Myanmar. My family and I moved from Myanmar to Ranong, Thailand. I was too young to know why we left Myanmar, but as I grew older I realized it was to escape our economic hardships.  I have lived in Ranong for the last 18 years and have no idea what my home country looks like now. I dont know what it ever looked like; I dont have any memories from Mawlamyine, not even memories in the form of stories. I never heard stories from my parents about life back in Burma, because growing up we never had spare time to spend together reminiscing. Everyone in my family would leave for work at dawn and return home at dusk. There werent any learning centers in Ranong for migrants like me, so I would attend classes taught by a migrant woman. Because she was undocumented, she would run out of the classroom and hide when the police would investigate the area. A few years later, some NGOs came to the community and created a legal migrant learning center, where I studied until the 6th grade. Due to financial difficulties in my family, I couldnt continue my studies. I started working at a plaza selling clothes. I worked there for about two years, then a pharmacy for about four years. Around that time, one of the foreigners I had met, Father John, established the Marist Asia Foundation (MAF) and with the help of one of my teachers from the migrant learning center, Teacher Ronald, I was able to continue my education. During my time at MAF, I took the Australian Catholic University (ACU) entrance exam and was selected to receive free education. This allowed me to receive my diploma. Now I work as an interpreter for the International Organization for Migration. This has been the best opportunity for me to give back to my own people. When I interpret for Burmese migrants, I feel useful because I can help them voice their difficulties and their experiences, but I also feel hopeless because I cant do more than interpret. The job of an interpreter isnt easy, especially when building trust with the person for whom youre interpreting is a prerequisite. It can be especially challenging for me to earn the trust of Buddhist Burmese migrants while I approach them wearing a hijab. It is up to me to earn their trust and to show them that even though we have some differences, we can coexist. Although I dont remember Myanmar, I still consider it home and miss it. However, I am grateful to Thailand for all the opportunities it has given me. I am indebted to the kindness of the Thai people, a people that have never discriminated against me in regard to my religion. Even though everything in Thailand is better compared to Myanmar—water, electricity, living condition, religious tolerance—I still have the dream of returning to Myanmar and helping bring change to my country and my people."
899	Siba	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	female	My name is Siba. I come from Suweida, a town in southwestern Syria. After many years of war, it became hard to lead a normal life so my family and I decided to move to Lebanon in 2014. We used to come here very often, when we could still move around freely. Lately, we were scared all the time and the sounds of the bombs became unbearable. Eventually, it was too dangerous to go out. In Syria, I was an electronics engineer—I used to work with all kinds of electronics. Unfortunately, since we arrived in Lebanon, I havent been able to work, but I havent asked for any assistance either. I didnt want it. My brothers and sisters are living in Canada, and we will be joining them. That will make life a bit easier. I will be able to offer a bright future to my children but also to myself. Both Nour and Jad want to be doctors. Canada gives them the opportunity to do what they dream of. For the moment, Jad is so excited to play sports again. He loves anything with a ball! Siba and her two children Nour and Jad will be resettled to Canada which will eventually take in 25,000 Syrian refugees from Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt.

My family arrived in Greece and we are now living at the accommodation center for migrants and refugees in Drama, northern Greece. I enjoy going to school and my favorite subject is English but I also want to keep learning Greek; I really like the Greek language. When I grow up, I want to be an interpreter. I dont have any Greek friends yet. But we go to school together every day and play ball during the breaks."
901	Silvia Plácido Bauer	Peru	Austria	L	E	far	6163	48106	H	im	female	My name is Silvia, I am Peruvian, and I was born in Pozuzo, Pasco. At home, my grandparents spoke to me in my mother tongue, Quechua. They always told me that if I understood Quechua it would be easier to learn any other language. They were right. It was very easy for me to learn German with my school teacher, Miss Delfina Randolf. I moved to Lima and there I lived 9 years with my mother, my brother Alejandro, and my dear Ari, my puppy. I studied Tourism and Hotelery and, like every Peruvian who wants to excel, I worked. I became a mother when I was very young, I was 18 years old. My son is one of my great reasons to be able to make every effort and move on. Years passed, and I decided to study a second career: Gastronomy. Currently, I am dedicated to gastronomy in Austria. I have been working in the kitchen of a hotel for 8 months, very close to the mountains in Tyrol. Here, they welcomed me as part of their family. I started helping decorate the dishes and washing the services. You get tired being in that area, but at the same time it is a great experience, because I was getting to know more about the business. I started to present new decoration and dessert options to my boss and she liked the idea. Now I am responsible for the desserts and I prepare a large part of them, always with a Peruvian touch. Now I'm saving, because I wish to go to Madrid and continue my training in high bakery. I want to start sending seeds from a tree called Kiri to my dad, Constantine. Kiri is known as the Empress Tree and has become popular for its CO2 consumption properties and rapid growth. My wish is that he sows them in Pozuzo and tell me how it grows. Being a migrant taught me to do my best, respecting the country that opened its doors to me. Always with a smile, always politely with everyone, because I think you represent your country wherever you go. It is sad to be away from my dear Peru and my dear family, but I thank God and life for all that I have achieved in this beautiful country that has become my new home.
902	Simona	Italy	Estonia	E	E	close	31238	23106	E	im	female	I was eight years old the first time I boarded a plane to travel alone out of my home island Sardinia. Since then, I have never stopped moving around. I visited Estonia the first time in 2004 when I took part of an international youth exchange. I made very good Estonian friends and I liked the country a lot. From the very first day of that trip I thought that one day I will come back for longer. In 2009, my university closed the program I was about to graduate from. I had to think of new priorities, goals and future for myself. In the same week, I got a call from an Estonian friend who proposed to me to move to Estonia for a year to work as a volunteer for an NGO dealing with youth mobility projects. I had one day to give the answer. I consulted my parents and after half an hour I decided I was going to leave everything behind and move to Estonia. I was supposed to stay in Tallinn for only one year, but then I met the person that today is my husband, I found a new job, I created a good network of friends, studied Estonian and really felt at home. So I never moved back to Sardinia. I was very lucky because I already had some Estonian friends before moving to Tallinn, but I have noticed that sometimes it can be very hard to integrate in the Estonian society. First I thought, it might be because of the language, but then I realized that it is the life in the city that keeps the barriers between people, foreigners or not. I know many foreigners who didn't speak a single word of Estonian, but went to live in little villages and they have integrated perfectly. Eventually and with time, they have also learned Estonian. In my view, if people have the chance to meet, talk and get to know each other in an informal way, this is the best way to integrate in a new environment and create communities where borders between locals and foreigners disappear. Estonians ask me often why I have decided to live in Estonia. I have many reasons, but now that I have been away for a while, I have come to the conclusion that I want to live in Estonia because I feel safe here to build a future and a family the way I wish. During the last five years, I have worked in the field of migration. I have met many people who have been forced to flee from their homes due to war or persecution. Some of them have lost everything and probably won't be able to go back home whenever they wish like I can. The reasons for migrating may be different, but in the end, we are all the same in our search for happiness and a stable and safe life.
903	Sirreh	Gambia	Liberia	A	A	close	757	491	E	im	female	I want to become a successful businesswoman and empower my fellow Gambian women. When I graduated from secondary school, my parents had a lot of hope in me. During those years, though, there were very limited employment opportunities in the country. I opened a cosmetics shop, but business was not lucrative, and I had many responsibilities. I was able to save a little from the business and embarked on the backway journey in April 2015, with the aim of bettering my life and my familys by reaching Europe. Indeed, it is not an easy route. My money finished when I got to Bamako, Mali, so my family had to send me up to GMD 70,000 (approximately USD 1,400) for me to get to Libya. In Libya, luckily, I was not sexually abused nor exploited, as others have experienced. However, I was imprisoned four times and my family paid roughly GMD 110,000 (approximately USD 2,000) for me to be freed. In prison, sometimes we went the whole day without drinking or eating. After four years in Libya, I really wanted to come home, but I had no money, no passport, nothing. I had no way out until I got in touch with IOM. Coming back home was the best option for me, because life in Libya was a total waste. The country was in chaos, and everyone lived in fear. Sometimes you get attacked from work and all the money you struggled to earn would be taken from you. I returned to The Gambia on 24 April 2019 and it was amazing to reunite with my family. A lot of resources were wasted on my journey, but everyone was happy to see me alive. Through my reintegration assistance, I started selling fashion merchandise, such as bags, shoes, and clothes. Sometimes, I sell secondhand goods and make more profit. I look forward to expanding my business by having a permanent shop where I can buy and sell goods, fashion merchandise, and cosmetics from different parts of the world.
904	Sister Aida	Lebanon	Chad	M	A	far	9310	679	L	im	female	I really appreciate Chadians, for their piety and hospitality whether Christian or Muslim, it is thanks to my migration to Chad, that I discovered this virtue. I am Aida, a religious sister, Lebanese migrant of the Sisters of the Holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and Director of the Centre Al-Mouna, an institution birthed from migration. I am originally from Mont Liban, of Jdeidet El Metn next to the capital of Beirut. Professionally, I am a social worker and community organizer. Before coming to Chad, I worked 22 years as a University professor and worked with CARITAS International in Lebanon with the Palestinian migrants displaced by the wars in the South of the country. For me, migration is a good thing, it allows us to change up the routine, discover new things and learn lessons, if we know how to take advantage of it. Also, at Centre Al-Mouna, we are an association that excepts everyone, without exception. Personally, I am pushing for Chadians to reach a level where ethnic and religious barriers dont stop us from accepting each other. My contribution, as a migrant, is to accept other migrants, as Chadians have accepted me, so we can live in love and pacifically, this is very important.
905	Smart	Sierra Leone	Niger	A	A	close	475	568	E	im	male	"My dad was 65 when he died. He woke up early every morning to go to work, and since he didnt have a car, every day was a struggle for him. As he got older, I tried to convince him to stop working. After I graduated in banking and finance, I tried finding a job in my field in Sierra Leone, but it proved to be impossible. I ended up teaching IT for a while at a school. I told my dad I would go to Europe, find a job and send them money. So I ended up going to Ghana to get a visa for Germany, but once rejected, I had to go back home. I told my dad I had friends in Ghana and that I wanted to go back to work with them. After a couple of days there, they called to tell me my dad had been taken to the hospital. My stepmom hadnt told me about his illness so I wouldnt worry. The day I got to know he was sick was the day I was told he had died. In Ghana, I met a family that offered me a job. In one years time, I had gained their trust so they asked me to move in, and help them take care of the house and their laundry business. I learned a lot from people in Ghana: how to talk, to say please, and to apologize. When I got home, my siblings told me I had changed. I taught them to be polite, and to have manners as well. When I was in Ghana, I used to watch the news, see all these people crossing the Mediterranean and thought I would never do it. But when I got back to Freetown and found out many of my friends had taken it, I decided to try as well. One friend in Italy encouraged me to do it; he told me I could make it. I thought this was my chance. I paid someone USD 2,500 to get me to Italy. Once the police found me, they put me in prison. I needed another USD 1,000 to go back home. My biggest regret is taking the route. I had a feeling I shouldnt have taken it. I lost all the money I had saved during my three years working in Ghana. Plus, the road is so dangerous because you have to go through the desert, there is no water, and there are thieves on the road. People are dying. I wouldnt try it again. I said to myself that my life was more precious than Italy. Since both of our parents died, all of my five siblings look up to me. When I was in Ghana, I used to send them money. I miss them all and my three-year-old daughter as well. None of my siblings knew I was going to take this route, except Junior. He is in highschool, studying finance as well. I want to take care of him. My biggest dream is to see them all happy."
906	Sofia	Georgia	Greece	I	E	far	3984	18117	E	im	female	My name is Sofia. I came to Greece in 2007, just to see it and eventually I stayed. I married a compatriot and we had children. I fell in love with the country. When I found out about the school bus escorts vacancy for the refugee children education programme, I immediately applied because it entailed working with children. I was not discouraged by the fact that it would be difficult to communicate with the children – since we dont speak the same language – as I believe that love is a universal language. Of course there were some difficulties at first, the children didnt speak Greek, I was trying to understand them and they were trying to understand me, we used signs and gestures. However, slowly, they learned, and I also learned a few words in their language. Gradually, it got easier. There were no real difficulties, I reckon. It is a job that you do only if you really want to and only if you love children. Its not important where the children come from. The fact that Im a migrant played a part in the way I bonded with the children however, the most important thing is that its been several years since my own children last lived with me, they are in Georgia. The primary school pupils are the same age as my daughters. I have two little girls. So, the presence of these children helped me a lot. I also got a lot of love from the parents. In the accommodation centre of Eleonas, where I started, I had 15 and 16 year-olds. Every day, I passed by each little house to pick them up for school and the parents always invited me in for a tea or a cup of coffee. Theyd often invite me to have dinner with them. I never had the chance to go but their invitations were such a nice gestures. It was hard when I left Eleonas to go to the accommodation centre of Schisto. It was a difficult transition for me and for the children alike. Id bump into them in the street or I visited them at Eleonas and they were so happy. Mama Sofia is what they called me. Imagine, a 15 year old tall boy calling you mama. In Eleonas, I had 18 children calling me mama. This was a sign of their trust. When talking with my daughters on Skype, I often showed them the students, and the children asked me about my daughters. They have learnt each other's names and were sending their love. On the last day of school, at Schisto, 5 or 6 girls cuddled around me and they were sobbing, while a little boy was waiting his turn to hug me. I tried to hold back my tears. They were running away and then running back towards me, it was a very emotional moment. You should have seen how they pulled and dragged me. They event wanted to give me the sandwich they were having. They begged me to stay at Schisto, they even found a place for me to stay! They said we will miss you, please come to visit us. I will never forget this little girl who never let me get close to her or kiss her. Cautiously, she started approaching me on her own and taking me by the hand. On the last day of school, she gave me so many kisses. I would like to say a big thank you to my colleagues. I made many new and very good friends. I have gained experience, Ive learnt so many things. Ive learnt that if you want to achieve something, with a little bit of hard work, you can do it. And we did it.
907	Sofia	Switzerland	Switzerland	E	E	close	86919	86919	E	hc	female	I was born in Geneva to parents working for the international organizations, so I consider myself a child of the United Nations. I was always exposed to music at home. When I was five years old, I saw a violinist play on TV and was fascinated. My mother thought it was only a phase until she saw me pretending to play violin with two wooden spoons. I joined the UN Orchestra when I was 15 years old. Music brings me joy. It is an important part of my everyday life and it brings another dimension to it. Being part of the orchestra helps me learn to interact with adults. I am well aware that in the orchestra, teenager or not, we all have to do our best. It takes me out of my teenage world, and my comfort zone. The United Nations Orchestra gives me the opportunity to be part of an effort to promote the ideals that the UN stands for and which I grew up with. For a young person like me, it is a privilege to have the chance to be part of something meaningful. We had the opportunity to go to South Korea last year during our Music for Peace tour. Playing at the demilitarized zone, connecting with the audience and being part of a meaningful cause was an extraordinary experience I will never forget. It moved me in ways that I did not expect. We could not understand each other with words but somehow, music helped us connect with locals. I remember that we had just arrived and were getting off the bus with our instruments when suddenly a group of small Korean children approached us, very curious about our instruments. They started to play with us and no matter the language barriers, we were just happy.

After my marriage, it was very difficult to take care of my children, although my husband tried to do small things, they just did not produce enough earnings to support our family. The anger and frustration forced me to leave for Faya, where I hoped to eventually make it to Europe. Here in Faya, I go door to door looking for clothes to wash, a small way to make a little bit of money. The two years that have passed in Faya, my life has not changed, thus I have decided to return to the family I left behind.

I found solace in music and initially trained on the piano before discovering my true talent as a singer. I pursued my passion for music by studying and gaining a BA Hons in Music and MA in Ethnomusicology. I returned to my Iranian roots by learning to play the tombak. My musical blend is the expression of a life torn between two cultures.
910	Sonja	United States	Chile	N	L	far	63123	13232	E	im	female	Nature, wine, seafood and breathtaking landscapes, Chile has it all and are some of the main reasons why my boyfriend and I chose to move here. In some aspects the move from America was easy since we both spoke Spanish. In other ways it was quite difficult. Moving from a small town in Virginia, United States of about 50,000 to Santiago, Chile was quite challenging. I had never lived in such a big city and it was overwhelming. Establishing connections with the community and making friends was much more difficult, given the sheer size of the city and the number of people living there. I moved to Chile with the aim of teaching English. However, since coming here I became interested in learning about migration and joined the International Organization for Migration to do an internship. My experience of moving to Chile has been greatly educational and enriching, but not always easy. The difficulties are not specific to Chile, but rather the general difficulties of finding ones own pace and making meaningful connections when one moves to a new place.
911	Sophal	Cambodia	Cambodia	I	I	close	1513	1513	E	hc	male	In 2015, I had an opportunity to migrate to Thailand for work which provided a higher salary and a position as an international staff member. I took the chance, believing it would be a remarkable experience and produce a better outcome for my family.  I remained in Thailand for 7 months. The first three months proved to be very difficult due to the language barrier. I couldnt communicate with people and I was not familiar with the food. The taste was very different from my home despite the fact that Cambodia and Thailand have quite similar cultures. Notwithstanding the challenges, I gained a lot from this experience. I learned about culture, lifestyle, and different standards of living. Through my work experience I expanded my professional knowledge beyond my expectation. I am now back in Cambodia, I endeavor to pass on those lessons learned to my own community. Migration to me is about learning and growing, and to share this experience with others.
912	Sophia	Yemen	Italy	M	E	far	937	31238	H	im	female	I am a free woman. I want to be Sophia, this is how I was born and who I want to be when I die. Sadly, this is also the reason why I had to leave my city in Yemen, where I was a working woman, driving my own car and who decided to divorce from her husband. Life in Yemen is not easy for an independent woman, and it became unbearable when I started receiving death threats. I arrived in Italy in 2013, and as soon as I was granted with an international protection status, I started to look into validating my degree. An officer working at the C.A.P.  (University Center for life-long learning) at the University of Bari, supported me throughout this process. Once my degree had been validated, I could also apply for a scholarship financed by the Italian Ministry of Interior to further my studies in intercultural communication. Learning the language was the first step that allowed me to feel part of Italian society, and it surely is the first step that all migrants should undertake in their new country. Language is empowering because, just like a bridge, it connects you with the 'other'. Language makes you more independent, and it inevitably allows you to access the culture. You actually start understanding your rights, and also duties, in your host country. Even if we might eventually go back, I think that, as refugees, we need to leave a positive mark on the country that hosts us. Women especially should not be intimidated or afraid to make choices and pursue their goals in life, although they feel they have the whole world against them. This is why I encourage women refugees to be supportive of other women and girls.
913	Souhaiel	Tunisia	Belgium	A	E	far	3318	45028	H	im	male	I come from Tunisia and I currently live in Brussels. I moved for the first time in 1970 when I was only nine months old with my family. My father worked in a textile company during nine years and when I was nine years old, we went back to Tunisia. Home to me is Tunisia and Malta as well, I moved there for about three years, maybe because it is close to Tunisia. It makes me feel like I am in the middle of people who look like me. We speak almost the same language, we share the same food and weather. If I were honest, Im only here in Belgium for professional reasons, without the work I would go back to Tunisia or look for another position in Malta. I miss the sea, the sun, my friends, and my language as well, I dont have the opportunity to speak Tunisian arabic here. I miss hearing the calls of the Mosque in the morning, the sound of our folkloric music and of course the food. The most interesting thing about migration is that you get to learn how other cultures are living and what they are doing on a daily basis. I am very curious about how they live their daily lives. When I go to a new country I see how people react, how they live outside, what their customs are. Its just being a little bit curious about the life of other people around you. Migrate? Yes, I would recommend it to acquire knowledge and to learn because migration is also about learning. We are learning from different cases. It is always very difficult to migrate, especially when you live alone without family. In my case, I came here in 1994, I was completely alone without any resources or funds, I had to work and stop my studies and it was very difficult. Several times I wanted to give up but I always found a new force inside me that made me stronger. There is also a lot of sacrifices to do, but we have to set our long term targets and objectives and try to reach them by following the reasonable rules and the best path in order to achieve them and get a better and decent life. In my time it was not easy at all, but I did not give up. At first I came here just to get a university degree and buy a car and then return back home, but now Ive been here for about 22 years and I do not regret it!
914	Souleyman	Gambia	Niger	A	A	close	757	568	E	im	male	"What is happening today in the Mediterranean is not about me and it is not about you. Its about thousands of Africans, especially young ones that are embarking on this route. Its about trying to save their lives. I happened to be one of them. Four months ago, if you had told me Id be living in such a place, surrounded by chaos and danger, I would have said youre crazy. But behind everything you see, there is a reason; whether you know it or not. When I was young, I was very ambitious. I had dreams - I wanted to become someone. When my parents divorced, I was a child and I became a burden to my family. In sixth grade, they told me I had to quit school and farm with them so we would have food to eat. I begged them to let me continue my studies, but they refused. I have met a lot of people with wasted talents because they couldnt afford education. In Africa, parents neglect your education, not because they dont care, but because here, it costs a fortune to be educated. When someone told me they were going to Europe, I told them not to go since its too dangerous. They called me a month later from Italy. You always hear stories about people dying, but the number of people who do make it is still high. So I thought of leaving too… but I couldnt afford the journey, not even after four years working within the same company. I was feeding my family and paying for my sisters school fees. I have a long way to go and I dont want to be doing the same job for the rest of my life. When I saved up to 2000 euros, I decided to try my luck. Every time I reached another city, I felt excited as I was getting closer to my destination. I was not used to these long journeys as The Gambia is small. It takes you 10 minutes to get from here to where you want to go. I had no idea it was going to be like this. But just like anybody else, I got cheated on the way. They asked me for money at every check point and I never received any receipts. The guy I had paid to take me stopped answering my calls one day. Ive lost everything I had. What can I do? Do you think I can go to the police today? Who would believe me? I dont even have papers. Someone recently approached me and offered me a place to stay in a house. He told me they had rice, I accepted. This has become my home for the past three months. We are 60 people all squeezed in a couple of dirty rooms. We help each other out; we give hope to each other because we all have the same goal in mind: reach Europe. There are people who work in IT, who are footballers, drivers, tailors, psychologists, doctors – all competent people. If we could put our skills to practice, we could make a difference. The smugglers always lie to you and postpone your departure; they blamed it on the government, on the military, and theres nothing you can do. When youve gained their trust, they send you to bus stations to recruit customers, and if the police catches you, youre the one who goes to jail. Youre a victim; a person at the wrong place at the wrong time. Thats why some people spend years on this route. They dont tell you what happens on the way. They only tell you to fear the sea. I saw boats often rescued; Ive seen boats which are small and overcrowded. Im scared to go back and Im scared to move forward - I fear for my future either way. If I go home now, they will think Im a coward; if I die, they will think Im a hero, but if I make it, everyone will be happy. If I went back now, they would blame me. They would say: Why didnt you give me the money instead, I would have crossed. We wasted all of this money on you. My family raised me so I can help them, not bring them down. Girls would mock me because I wasnt even strong enough for the journey; that I was scared of dying; that the guy next door made it to Italy and I couldnt. Depression, frustration, isolation, and loneliness would become my friends."

I couldnt afford to continue my studies either so I decided to go to Europe; I had been encouraged to go by friends who had all made it there, but it was never my original desire. By the time I reached Agadez in Niger, I had already started losing all hope. After spending almost two months on the road to Libya, I proceeded to Tripoli where I was supposed to take a boat and cross to Europe. At about 10pm on the night of the crossing, our boat broke down. A rescue boat came and took us back to shore and then to Griana prison; there were over 100 people there. They would give us one pot of milk and one piece of bread every day at midnight, then we wouldnt eat again for the next 24 hours. Every couple of days someone else would die. I spent almost three months there until they decided to relocate some of the people to another prison in Sabha, including me. I spent another four months in the second prison until my family paid a ransom. After I got out, I worked for four months until I saved enough to go to Tripoli again. That was my second attempt to go to Europe; we spent almost a month in the connection house in Tripoli until the weather was stable enough for us to cross. On our way, the water mixed with oil in the boat's engine, and it stopped. We were stranded at sea for four days. Some fishermen captured us and took us back to prison where I spent another four months. Once again the jailers made us call our families to ask for money in exchange for our release -- my parents told me that upon my release, I should go back to Gambia. Some of my friends didnt even have contact numbers for their families. They assumed that they would only get in touch with their families once they reached Europe. For these people it was impossible to get released because they had no one that could pay for them. If you dont pay, you dont get out. Finding food was a daily struggle: you need money, and in order to get money, you need to work. However, working is a risky business. On your way to work you can be robbed or, even worse, killed. One day on my way back to the ghetto with my friend, we were attacked; the assailants shot him dead. I took him back to the ghetto and someone managed to take his body to a hospital, where it lay for a week before they decided to bury him. After I attended his funeral with his younger brother, I called his parents to let them know what had happened, and they begged us to go back to Gambia. The things I have seen in Libya are a valuable life lesson for me. People are different - some lose their minds over the things they witness in Libya. I dont want my family or my country to lose me. Maybe I can become someone once Im back, and help my country develop, but I need to be alive in order for that to happen. My fellow brothers need to know that this route is one of sacrifice. You dont know how you will die, but chances are it will happen. We should stay in our country and feed on what we have.

Il sagit de milliers dAfricains, en particulier de jeunes migrants qui sengagent dans le périlleux voyage migratoire. Il faut sauver leurs vies. Je suis un migrant comme tous ces jeunes. Il y a quatre mois, si on mavait dit que jaurais vécu dans une situation si chaotique et si dangereuse, jaurais répondu : cest de la folie !. Cependant, il y a une explication à toute chose, que vous le sachiez ou non. Quand jétais jeune, jétais très ambitieux. Javais des rêves - je voulais devenir quelquun. Lorsque mes parents ont divorcé, jétais un enfant et du coup, je suis devenu un fardeau pour la famille. À ma sixième année à lécole, on mobligea à abandonner les études pour aller travailler dans les champs afin que nous puissions assurer la subsistance de la famille, sinon je deviendrais un problème pour la famille. Jai supplié mes parents de me laisser poursuivre mes études, malheureusement ils ont refusé. Jai rencontré beaucoup de gens dont les talents ont été gâchés, car nayant pas eu les moyens de payer leurs études. En Afrique, les parents négligent les études, pas parce quils ne sen soucient pas, mais parce quelles coûtent une fortune. Un jour, quelquun ma dit quil partait en Europe, je lui en ai déconseillé, car cest trop risqué. Un mois plus tard, il ma appelé depuis lItalie. Vous entendez toujours des histoires sur les personnes qui meurent, mais le nombre de personnes qui réussissent est plus important. Alors, jai envisagé de partir moi aussi… mais je navais pas largent requis pour payer le voyage, pas même après quatre années de travail dans la même entreprise. Jétais le soutien de ma famille et je payais les frais de scolarité de ma sœur. Jai beaucoup de responsabilités qui mattendent et je ne veux pas passer le reste de ma vie à faire le même boulot. Alors, lorsque jai eu 2000 euros déconomies, jai décidé de tenter ma chance. Jétais content chaque fois que jarrivais dans une ville, car cela montrait que je mapprochais de plus en plus de ma destination. Je nétais pas habitué aux longs voyages en tant ressortissant de la Gambie, petit pays où lon peut se déplacer dun lieu à un autre en quelques minutes. Je nimaginais pas que nous serions dans un tel pétrin. Jai été trompé comme tous les autres migrants. À chaque poste de contrôle, ils mont demandé de largent sans jamais me donner un seul reçu ou justificatif de paiement. Le passeur que jai payé pour soccuper de mon voyage ne répond plus à mes appels. Jai perdu tout ce que javais. Quest-ce que je peux faire maintenant ? Pensez-vous que je peux aller à la police aujourdhui ? Qui va me croire ? Je nai même pas de papiers. Récemment, un homme est venu me proposer de maccueillir dans ce ghetto. Il ma indiqué dit quil y avait de la nourriture, notamment du riz à manger. Jai accepté son assistance. Je vis dans cet endroit depuis trois mois. Nous sommes 60 personnes entassées dans quelques chambres insalubres. Nous nous entre-aidons ; nous nous encourageons mutuellement parce que nous avons tous le même objectif : rejoindre lEurope. Il y a ici des informaticiens, des footballeurs, des chauffeurs, des couturiers, des psychologues, des médecins – chaque individu avec des compétences dans un domaine. Si nous parvenions à mettre en pratique nos compétences, cela pourrait beaucoup nous aider. Les passeurs ne disent jamais la vérité et ne cessent de reporter notre date de départ. Ils accusent le gouvernement, larmée, et on ny peut rien. Lorsquils vous font confiance, ils vous envoient aux gares routières pour recruter des clients, et si la police vous attrape, vous partez seuls en prison. En fait, vous nêtes quune victime ; une personne au mauvais endroit au mauvais moment. Cest pourquoi certaines personnes passent des années sur cette route. Ils ne vous disent pas ce qui se passe au cours du voyage. Ils vous disent seulement de vous méfier de la mer. Jai vu des embarcations souvent secourues ; jen ai vu aussi de petites dimensions surchargées de migrants. Actuellement, jai peur de rentrer chez moi et jai également peur de poursuivre le voyage - je crains pour mon avenir de toute façon. Si je rentre chez moi maintenant, ils penseront que je suis un lâche. Si je meurs, ils diront que je suis un héros. Et, si je parviens à rejoindre lEurope, tout le monde sera content. Si je rentrais au pays, mes parents me blâmeraient. Certains diront : Pourquoi tu me nas pas donné largent ? Jaurais réussi à rejoindre lEurope. Nous avons gaspillé tout cet argent pour toi. Mes parents mont élevé afin que je puisse les aider, pas pour les décevoir. Mêmes les filles se moqueraient de moi parce que je nai pas été assez brave pour arriver à destination ; parce que jai eu peur de mourir ; que le voisin est arrivé en Italie et moi je nai pas pu le faire. Je serais déprimé, frustré, isolé et solitaire »."
917	Stefan	Germany	Germany	E	E	close	45909	45909	E	hc	male	My uncle was a very cosmopolitan person who traveled a lot throughout the world. Through my interactions with him, I got a sense of what it is like to be in other countries. This awakened my interest in the world. Since childhood, I have always been very inquisitive, flexible and open. I always took pleasure in getting to know other people and other countries. I've lived in 21 countries and I worked as a corporate consultant. I have one main principle: I always try to meet people on equal terms. I also have no difficulties dealing with high-ranking people like a sheik, an emir, a chairperson of the board or a multimillionaire. They are first and foremost people and I try to meet them as such and to seek a dialog with them. After my foreign assignments, I enjoy coming back here, I look forward to seeing my family and Bavaria. I also appreciate the change of the seasons. We have to be open to the people coming here from foreign countries. But it's not a one-sided thing. Both sides have to do their part. This implies that they learn the language, that they want to become integrated into this culture group and that they adopt certain rules of conduct. We should support these people if they fulfill our requirements. But it would be unacceptable if these people came here and just made demands. There has to be a mutual give and take. Just taking and not giving anything in return does not be allowed to work.

But because of the limited opportunities, he applied in other countries in Europe. I could move to any country at the time, but the UK was my best option. It didnt take a long time to get a job with his qualifications and 13 years of experience. To be honest, I didnt struggle in UK, maybe I was too lucky. I found a job, my wife could come along, I bought a flat, and Ive worked in big companies. But once you leave home, you are pretty much ready to go anywhere. Being in the UK is a very pleasant experience for us at the moment. But, I cannot tell you that I will stay here forever. There are things I do not like. I dont feel there is a real integration or interaction between foreigners. There is a relationship between the different peoples, but so far, every person seems to support people from their own country because of this lack of integration. On the other hand, everyone is respectful of one another; no one bothers anyone else. Nobody seems to be racist, and foreigners can find good opportunities in many companies. Of course, there are negatives and positives, but I should say there are more positives in the UK, which is why I am happy here."

People say about New York - if you can make it there you can make it anywhere. Personally, I think that's London. Have amazing friends all over the world and have travelled to discover places and cultures. Had the chance to contribute to raising money for various charities and will always be passionate about Sustainability and Climate Change. I support and promote small businesses, botanical gardens, art, independent thinkers. My amazing friends and relatives have shaped me into who I am: runner, diver, climber, professional self mocker, Londoner, fighter, traveller, day dreamer, social justice promoter. Don't think I have done enough yet, there is always so much more we can do to influence people's lives for the best and promote quality of life.
920	Stéphanie	France	Germany	E	E	close	38959	45909	E	im	female	I grew up in France close to Geneva, in a relatively international atmosphere. During my time there I met people from different cultural backgrounds, and it led me to be curious about other countries! At first my English was not too good, but after years of practicing I felt ready enough to travel the world. After an Erasmus exchange at the University of Munich when I was 24 years old, I decided 6 years ago to migrate to Germany to have more opportunities and live in the best city in the world. Now I work in Bavaria: I speak German too, and I love my adoptive culture — it feels like home! I'm thankful to the European Union for contributing to this experience by making my Erasmus exchange possible, and I'm so thankful to Germany for being a great host not only to me, but also to millions of people with bigger, more serious needs. Being a migrant was a choice for me and I wish it could be the same for others too, but in most cases it is a matter of survival. I would like to show my respect and my support to all who try to get a better future in another country!

The judge said since my dad had escaped from prison, I should go to jail in his place. That is when my mother decided to organize a way for me to escape, since the government was planning to send me to prison for 5 years. I felt I was already dead, explained the 17-year old. Stevens mother chose to send him to Brazil because in the previous years there had been many political refugees from DR Congo in Europe and when some of them were sent back to the African country, they were killed or sent to prison. Stevens mother wanted to send him to a country far away from DR Congo to make sure he would be safe. I arrived in Brazil like a cat in a bag, without my family, said Steven who was sent to Caritas, a faith-based humanitarian organization, when he arrived in São Paulo in 2014. Steve now speaks Portuguese fluently and is finishing high school in Brazil. He is also one of the 14 teachers of the project Abraço Cultural, where, besides cultural workshops, migrants are teaching English, Spanish, Arabic and French with a cultural perspective. This initiative aims to deconstruct the prejudice and stereotypes against migrants and to help them better engage with Brazilian society. Even though the global perception is that Brazil is a laid back country with a considerable mixture of different ethnicities, prejudice against migrants is an issue. Steven says that he is glad to have the chance to be part of Abraço Cultural, but that life in Brazil is still not so easy for a migrant. I will be happy in Brazil, when I organize myself. Right now I am not organized yet. I still live in a shelter. I talk often with my mom on the phone and she always say she's fine, but I know that in reality things are not going well there. I'm worried about my family.

We want the right to education for all children, regardless of their status; Because a country that wants to grow must have people to build it. Because school is where we begin to love justice. Because school is a way to freedom. Because we do not want to be victims, but students. Because school means meeting friends, who become a second family. Because as girls we have the chance to get the same education as boys. Because we want all children to go to school like we can, to have freedom of expression and a second chance, as we have had thanks to our professors. Because education will help us conquer our dreams. Because effort, hard work and patience are key ingredients for a successful life. Because school will allow us to provide a better life for our families. Because we learn new languages, new cultures. Because we hope we will be able to create our own businesses. Because it is a right many young people do not have access to. Because we learn to live together and respect one another and this will serve us all our lives. Because education is an essential tool. Because yesterday we were different, today we are different, and tomorrow we will be different, thanks to education. But essentially because an educated person is a free person, with the power to choose their own future career, to defend their thoughts and rights, and to gain their independence, we want more schools and the right to education for all children. We are 200 young migrants, eager to achieve our dreams. Find their testimonies on Educatingthefuture.ch. Educating the Future is an initiative from the students of Geneva schools (ACPO and Espace Entreprise) to celebrate the International Day of Democracy when 200 young migrants between the ages of 15 and 19 go to the UN to discover the role of international Geneva and converse with international officials."

I wanted to take a ship from Turkey to Greece, but we kept getting caught by the coast guard in Greece and sent back to Turkey. I tried five times – once, the boat overturned and sank. From all the things I took with me, only this cell phone is left. My mother bought it just before I fled Afghanistan – she spent 3.000 Afghani (about £34) on it. That's half of my family's monthly income. The phone was the only way I could let my family know where I was on my journey and that I was OK. My mother was very worried, so a call from time to time helped to calm her down. The phone also made me feel safer and less lonely.

I was happy in Lahore and I had a job but my reason for coming was to be with my husband. He is a very well-educated person, so we wanted him to find a good job, which he could not find in Pakistan. Once he got an offer from a company here, he moved to give us a better life. Libyan culture is not super different to Pakistani culture, as its a Muslim country. Im Christian and I wear the Hijab to keep a low profile and mix in with society. My family in-law has been living here forever, so once I arrived I already had a support system. They know everything about Libya. My husband always liked Libya – he grew up here with his brothers. He was going back and forth to Pakistan. His father died here, in fact, and my mother in law is still here. She used to work as a nurse too. Some people here, in the Tripoli Medical Centre, face problems with communication because they dont speak Arabic. But since I speak Urdu, its easier for me to communicate with the society. I like my job here. Im working in the same role as I did in Pakistan, but my salary here is better than it was there. For now, we are planning to stay here for another four or five years. My children are studying in the Pakistani school in Tripoli and they have Libyan classmates. Actually, my two children speak better Arabic than me. They have the Libyan accent. Were planning to go back to Pakistan to visit, as I miss my parents. I havent seen them since I left. I also have a promise to keep to my children. We will be taking them to Murree – a beautiful landscape area of mountains. They always wanted to go there, but my husband was in Libya, so I kept telling them once your father is back we will go all together. At first, I didnt want to come to Libya because the services for children are better in Pakistan, but I wanted to stay with my husband. My children are happy here.

In the 1990s, tens of thousands of ethnic Nepalese fled violence and persecution in neighbouring Bhutan. Almost 100,000 have been resettled by IOM, mainly to the USA, but also to Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway. Suman and her two daughters now call the City of Angels - Los Angeles – home. One of their cousins left Nepal some years back and is running a small but thriving beauty parlour. We met them on the day they were due to leave – full of nerves, chatter and excitement. Their future is bright. They all speak excellent English, honed by years of teaching the language to fellow refugees in unofficial schools. The girls are full of chatter about LA, the studies they want to pursue, but the mothers face, though smiling, betrays a deep sadness. As soon as I get my green card and enough money I will come back and visit Bhutan. Ive not been there for 20 years; my daughters were born here as refugees, but I love my country. I love Bhutan. She left, she says, because of the threat of rape in a time of conflict. As a young woman she saw the sexual violence meted out by soldiers on her peers. She doesnt want to say much, but her daughters are proud independent women, and they interject: She told us what happened. Women were tied up in trees and repeatedly raped. She hid in the roofspace to avoid it. Life as a refugee has been hard. They would bully us, says Numa. Theyd say we smell and eat worms, but it all stopped three years ago when we went into the resettlement programme. They thought they might get some benefits if they were nicer to us. Their plans for America are grounded in realism. Its not going to be easy. We will have to work hard, says Suman. But you know, you just know when you hear them talk and you see their faces, that they are going to be OK. They have been waiting years for this, the day of departure. Their last staging post is the IOM transit centre in Kathmandu – the last link in a chain of self and guided preparation in everything from how to get a job to how to fasten an aeroplane safety belt"
926	Sumitra	Pakistan	India	I	I	close	1167	1931	E	im	female	"I was born in Kashmir as the fourth of seven siblings and educated in Lahore, now Pakistan, where my dad had been posted as an engineer. I was a Masters student at the time of the communal riots in Lahore and I had to be escorted to the examination hall during my final exam. I still remember the sound of the gunshots, concentrating was very difficult and we were all frightened. However I had studied very hard and I was determined in taking my exams. On an evening of April 1947 we were all evacuated from Lahore to Shimla, in the Indian State of Himachal Pradesh. No one wanted to leave: Lahore was beautiful. It was a vibrant city and a very famous centre for education, and in Shimla there was no college. I will never forget Lahore. Till I die it will always be in my memories. We then moved from Shimla, at that time the Summer Capital of the Indian government, to Delhi. Life in Delhi at the beginning was difficult, we lived in a refugees colony that the government had set up for people who were forced to leave what is now Pakistan. But life is about attitude, you tend to forget about the difficulties and you remember the nice things, not the miseries. In Delhi I went back to my education and pursued a Masters in Political Science which helped me in finding a job. The government had set up a Ministry of Rehabilitation for the people who had been affected by the partition and I was called to manage the unit in charge of rehabilitating the partition women. The unit provided women with sewing machines and tailoring training and with time got very popular. However at the beginning I had no work experience, to the point that I could even ask for basic tools for the women at the Minister himself. Once I even told to a colleague that he should have not touched his mustache when talking to me (in India a man touching and curling his mustaches is an offensive sign: it implies that the person the man is talking to his servant). Next day the man came to work completely shaved! I was so embarrassed. I did not mean to make him feeling bad. But I have always been very naughty. Then I learned, as you do in life and at work. The unit for the women rehabilitation grew and became very successful. When eventually the Ministry of Rehabilitation was to be closed and people had being settled, I moved to the Ministry of Commerce. I then married at the age of 54, on February 5th 1973. I was not the marrying type; I did not want to get tied down but my husband waited so long. He was a medical doctor in the army. His medical profession fascinated me; I felt he was the perfect doctor. He is now 103 and I am 97 and we are still very happy together."

I arrived with the expectation of meeting a long lost cousin, the kind that everyone has in their family. I migrated because of the economic situation that we had in Argentina that left me unable to support my sons education. The impression that I had once we arrived in Guatemala was charming, I arrived a few days before Easter and I didnt understand the religious passion that the Holy Week meant because we dont have that in Argentina. We have two or three days of Holy Week, but we dont have that fervour that Guatemala has. I remember that once we went sightseeing and I saw some people with costumes, so I asked my cousin if it was for a carnival because back in Argentina we only dress up for carnivals, but she told me that the people were dressed like that because of the processions for Holy Week. Another time, we were out walking around the neighbourhood and I kept hearing people clapping. The clapping was constant and at different times of the day, so I told my cousin that people in Guatemala always seem happy and partying because they were always clapping but she told me it wasnt the case. The clapping was because people were making corn tortillas. Susana also found differences with the food and the peculiarities of the Guatemalan people. Argentinians are used to grilled meat and empanadas, that is fundamental for us, but its not the case here. So I had to get used to tortillas and beans. Also, Argentinians are more straight-forward when it comes to saying what we think, Guatemalans are more diplomatic in that sense. Nowadays, Susana works with the Guatemalan government as the Director of the Art Archives. For me, my work is priceless. As an Argentinian, I feel privileged to be able to work in a place like this. Not just because Im helping this country with my work, but because in here we have Guatemalan art archives. This is an important place to be and, to top it off, I am working in something that I love.

I hope the knowledge they gain will help them be productive individuals. had always dreamt of going abroad in the hope of bettering my future. My plan was to get some welding materials when I travel, develop myself and come back to my country. I wanted to be anywhere in Europe, but Belgium had always been my first choice. Finally, on 4 December 2015, I left The Gambia with five of my friends, but we lost contact when we got Libya. I heard from another friend that they made it to Italy, but I am yet to hear from any of them. Our journey was a long one— from Banjul, to Mali, to Burkina Faso and to Niamey, Niger. We spent five days in the dessert before finally reaching Libya. Libya was difficult. We were indoors for four months without being able to go out, as we feared the war. I decided this was not sustainable and went out to find a job. I was in Libya for way longer than expected—a year and three months— because, every time I wanted to leave, my boss successfully pleaded with me to stay. I stayed in Libya harnessing my skills in welding, but living in Europe, not Libya, was the reason I left my country. I finally decided to try my luck at sea. Unfortunately, when the boat was about to leave, they left me and two others on shore because the boat was already full, they claimed. As a result, we were captured and taken to prison. IOM visited us one day and informed us that they could assist us to return to our countries. I decided I was ready to come back home, since crossing to Italy seemed very difficult and risky. When I came back home, my dad got sick. There was a lot of talking—everyone was wondering if I brought a disease with me from abroad. Thankfully, I received my reintegration support shortly after I came back and opened my own welding shop. My customer base varies because of the quality and efficiency of services that I deliver. People from different places will come for my service. We all know how business can sometimes be dull, but my plan is to expand this business when I have the required materials.

I spent 6 years doing this here in Estonia. For various reasons, I returned to Russia. While in Russia, I longed to return, because I love the sea in Estonia and the countrys aesthetic beauty. I felt there were many opportunities as an artist for me in Estonia. Consequently, I returned in the beginning of millennium. By then Estonia was an independent republic with borders and I had a travel passport. I had sold my house in Russia to begin my artist career in Estonia. Soon after I was told my specialty was no longer needed. I began looking for ways to make a living in Estonia using my talents. During the numerous years that I have been here I have been sewing, drawing, teaching, colour consulting, doing art therapy, sketching Feng Shui interior design projects for architects, caring for animals, babysitting and of course doing my own art. Challenging times pushed and I pushed back, forcing me to find ways to manage. Since my specialty is silk painting, I developed my own technique of painting on leather. Using this medium I drew thousands of pictures of Tallinn. For this reason I always say I should be recognized as a special citizen of Estonia. A good time for me was when I worked together with architects on Feng Shui and landscape projects. Much of my work is in private collections in Russia, Estonia, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and the United States I am especially proud of one work I did with Chinese symbolism. My client had heard a legend that said during a great fire in one Chinese village all houses but one burned down. The house that remained had an image of a dragon on its wall. My client also wanted a dragon on his wall. I made a silk painting with a dragon and 15 other symbols, all of the creatures on the picture have diamonds as their eyes. Another of my works, which I find very special, is a panagia of Virgin Mary. It was a gift for a family in Bulgaria. The family took the icon to their church to ask for a blessing. I am still astounded that the priest changed into his sacred garb before blessing the icon. I am an artist. I didnt advertise myself or my work, my clients found me. To this day all of my clients are pleased with my work. We have even become friends. Yet, it has always been like this, an artist cannot support himself – she either provides for a family or focuses on art. I am a typical artist. It is impossible to earn and live off of my art. I now need to leave Estonia, so I am waiting for the completion of my paperwork. I am moving back to Russia, where I hope I can own a private workspace, focus on my art and hopefully one day visit India, China and Hong Kong.
930	Syed	Bangladesh	Portugal	I	E	far	2001	22413	H	im	male	"Mãe (mother) is my favourite word in Portuguese. When I arrived in Portugal, I once saw a very young girl shouting mãe repeatedly to her mother, with a particular sound that I had never heard before. I was immediately curious about the meaning of that word. I come from Bangladesh and my mother tongue is Bengali, a language which is very dear to me. I find Portuguese to be very beautiful too, with very distinct sounds and qualities. I was born in Bangladesh and I had many artistic hobbies growing up. When I got married, my family and children became my utmost priority. I have always done everything to provide them with the best possible education. I first moved to Qatar to find new job prospects and worked there as a banker. Despite the opportunity and the years I spent there, I was never happy. My health also deteriorated considerably. I then moved to England, but I couldn't meet the requirements to remain there legally. At that time my younger brother was working in the fields here in Portugal so I decided to move to Lisbon to look for new opportunities. Coming to Lisbon three years ago completely changed my life. As someone who suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, I strongly benefitted from Portugals healthy food (especially grilled fish!), the quality of its drinking water and its weather. I now exercise more and have a healthier lifestyle. I also feel safer here. It is easier to be a migrant in Lisbon, because everything you may need is located in the city center. This makes it easier for those who do not speak Portuguese well yet. My greatest challenge here has been finding a job. I am learning Portuguese and have already completed two courses. My understanding of the language has improved but I still need to practice speaking with others. I also find it difficult to be away from family. I especially miss my mother, my daughter and my son. I am happy that they are both attending university in Bangladesh studying accountancy, but I fear for their safety there. I also miss visiting my father's grave. Visiting our loved-ones graves regularly and praying for them is a tradition in Bangladesh; graves are always located close to our houses. Overall, I have enjoyed my Portuguese experience here so far. I find Portuguese people to be very similar to Bangladeshis, especially the older people. Seniors always smile to me. They do not seem to care for age or race, and they just greet everyone. It is a lovely habit that all generations should practice!"
931	Sylla	Guinea	Niger	A	A	close	1179	568	E	im	male	When I heard that my friends made it to Europe I went to the bank and took all my money out. I paid 500 Euros in advance to people who promised to take me there, and left 500 with my grandmother. She planned to send it to me once I arrived in Libya to pay to cross the sea to Italy. There are check points throughout the journey where you have to pay to pass through otherwise they put you in prison. However, once I reached Sabha, Libya, I was arrested. We were five of us Guinean men in the room. They tied us and started accusing us of being from Boko Haram. We told them that we were not, and they took us into a huge camp. The communication was difficult because we did not understand Arabic and they did not understand French, so we used our hands. They asked us for 1,000 Dinars, which is 650,00 Euros, but we told them that was too much. So they started beating us up with sticks for hours and hours. I had no option but to call my grandmother and ask for more money. She told me that I had lost my mind, that it was too much, and she started to cry. But in the end she had to send the money to free me. I had eventually made it all the way to the border of the sea. We were to leave on those rubber dinghies, but I was somehow confident as I had read that the Pope Francis had said that the authorities in Italy would not let Lampedusa become a cemetery. But the person I had paid to cross the sea told us to wait in the bush and never came back.  He abandoned us. I want to write about everything that happened to me … everything! I love to write and tell stories. I did not have the chance to go to the university, but I did go to a professional school. I am a cameraman, so I will go back to my country and try to find a job there. At the end, we are the ones who have to find a solution in our country. I will work there and one day I will go to Europe in a legal way.
932	Sylvie	France	Switzerland	E	E	close	38959	86919	E	im	female	I moved away from France to study abroad and work before my travels brought me to Switzerland. I've been working with migrants for 15 years, first as a teacher of the French language, then as a professional coach trying to help migrants find jobs. In the past few years I have worked as a facilitator of inclusive and interactive activities: to help migrants connect socially, culturally, professionally and emotionally while finding a place in their new country. My advice to everyone moving to a new country: observe what is going on, be openminded, ask questions, be curious and find people who have the same hobbies as you in order to connect on a fun level. We are all migrants, by choice or by force. We are all human beings. But I don't like the word integration, I prefer inclusion. We all have to work to be a part of the society you live in, give and receive, contribute. Migration is an opportunity to learn from one another, to broaden our horizons and to connect with people from all over the world. By being curious, we can learn a lot from everyone that we encounter. If we removed all the labels, no one would necessarily know who is a migrant and who is a local. Everyone is rich from their life experience — sharing them and listening to others is how we all grow and become better people.
933	Sylwia	Poland	Germany	E	E	close	15764	45909	E	im	female	I started my professional life just a few years after the democratic transition in Poland. It was a great time. Everything was open, everything was new, everything grew and became better from day to day. But I was too young and inexperienced to understand what was going on. I never planned to emigrate in order to work abroad, there was no reason for it. I had a comfortable life and all the amenities of the new upper class. After nine years in an international company, I wanted a change. Again, I found a very good position. Shortly before I was supposed to start the new job, I was told that this department would be transferred from Warsaw to Munich on short-notice. I was given one week to decide whether I still wanted to accept the job. It was a very difficult week for me. Finally, I decided to take the job and move to Munich. Then I came to Germany and found a lot of differences to Poland. In Poland people fight against each other at their workplace, in Germany, there is more cooperation. I like that very much. There is also a big difference regarding the lifestyle. Here, people pay attention to a good work-life-balance. After the office hours, you leave work and engage in many different leisure activities. On Sunday, all the shops are closed and it's all about recreation. In Warsaw, the shops are open on Sundays, but since I also worked on Sundays, I had hardly any time to do the shopping. I was very afraid about coming here. Due to historic events, we were always told how evil Germans are. In magazines I read that the Germans think the Polish steal cars, are prostitutes, wanted as cleaning ladies or as cheap personnel in retirement homes. I was worried that I would also be treated this way. But as surprise, I was cordially received and everybody was nice to me. With my colleagues, it felt like a family - not only in the workplace, but also in our free time. I enjoyed that very much. We had a lot of fun.
934	Taffan	Iraq	Sweden	M	E	far	4146	53575	H	im	female	"I was a toddler when I first came to Sweden. I left my home of Kurdistan Iraq when the Iraqi forces launched the Anfal Campaign against the Kurds. Our towns and villages were attacked by chemical weapons, and many women and children were sent to camps where they lived in appalling conditions. I lost both my uncle and grandmother as a result of this. As the war continued my parents decided that Kurdistan Iraq was no longer an ideal place to raise a family in peace. My father, a Peshmerga -the Kurdish word for someone who faces death- worked and saved so we could move to Europe. He knew smugglers and people who would illegally get us across borders. With their help we eventually arrived in Sweden. My childhood in Sweden included everything a child could ask for after having witnessed the conflict of war. Our frequent family trips to Kurdistan allowed us to remain familiar with our mother tongue, our traditions, our history, and never forget our roots. However, each time I visited Kurdistan I experienced the significant division of genders. I found it very strange to see how dominant the men were and how big their role was in Kurdish society. I made the decision to return to Kurdistan a few years ago to work on the issue of womens rights, despite the fact that the war with ISIS had just broken. I knew that I had to reach out to young girls here. I realized quickly that human rights were lacking and I could impact and influence people my age. Despite all the obstacles, my determination was not weakened and today I proudly run my own foundation, I work at refugee camps, I lecture about womens and refugees rights and I share stories of women who have been former sex slaves to ISIS; I finance integration projects in Sweden and much more. I have simply found my passion in life. The kids in my class used to make fun of me for being Kurdish and previously a refugee. I often heard things such as Go back to where you came from, wherever that is now as it is not on the map. Or You are stateless, Kurdistan does not exist so you do not exist. Or even There is no such thing as Kurdistan, you are an Iraqi whether you want to admit it or not. I was eventually bullied to the point where I changed schools or classes. This caused me to question my identity and it paved the way for me to start denying my own background. I love and have always loved my life in Sweden. I owe this country so much and all that I have today is due to the fact that they took me and my family in when we were fleeing a war. Having lived in two different countries with very different cultural and traditional backgrounds, I have learnt to accept cultural diversity and how to communicate effectively with people from all over the world. My country is the earth, and I am a citizen of the world. Kurdistan is home to me because its where I was born, but so is Sweden and so many other places on earth. I have been fortunate enough to travel a lot with my work and have been to amazing parts of the world. Each country has given me things in terms of knowledge and experiences, that have molded me to the person I am today. Home to me is a certain feeling. To me it means safety, it means knowing that wherever I am in the world, whatever money, food, or possessions I have to my name, I have a place to return to. Home, to me, means Im never really lost.   Taffan is a Social Entrepreneur and Lecturer, and a One Young World Ambassador."
935	Tággidi	Brazil	Ireland	L	E	far	6797	86251	H	im	female	Finding work in Dublin as a young Brazilian can be extremely challenging, says Tággidi as she takes a sip from her cappuccino. Its even more difficult if youre considered old, she adds. The São Paulo native, who looks younger than her 34 years, says she has struggled to find employment since she moved to Ireland last September to learn English. Ive applied for everything: sales assistant, au pair, childminder, babysitter, nanny, in pubs, waitress, staff, deli, anything. Ive lost count. I dont know how many CVs I handed out. Tággidi says some au pair agencies arent interested in women over 30. She briefly worked for a family as child minder, but left after 10 days when she realised how low the salary was. Ive looked for au pair jobs and had good interviews but once I ask them to pay me what the Government says is the legal amount, they say no. Most of the time families will pay €100-€150 a week. Tággidi soon realised the key to finding work in Ireland was knowing people in the industry. She also learned that childminding and waitressing werent the only employment opportunities available to young Brazilian women.

It took a few months till I arrived in Switzerland. Most of the time I was walking. Sometimes we had to cross a river by a rubber boat. I only took these three photos with me. Every single one stands for a certain time in my life before my escape, that I like to remember. If I could I would have taken more things with me, but it was impossible.
937	Takuya	Japan	Switzerland	I	E	far	39990	86919	E	im	male	I left Osaka for Colombo in Sri Lanka when I was 31 to take a 3-month IOM assignment as an architect on shelter construction for Tsunami victims. Colombo was so noisy! Taxi drivers were honking all the time. I was not really used to that. Music was part of my life since a very young age: when I was 11, my mother suggested I learn an instrument which would enrich my life. I picked up the flute as we could find a teacher in the neighborhood at that time. I stopped playing the flute after joining IOM in 2005 since I couldnt enjoy playing the flute in a stressful environment. When I moved to Geneva from Haiti and heard about this Orchestra, I strongly felt a need to play flute again. I feel I am creating something together with the others and playing in an orchestra makes me feel livable. Im based in Geneva, surrounded by people from all over the world and living in such a dynamic relentless environment. Here, we need to speak up for ourselves while in Japan, the silence is beauty and we always avoid giving our opinions until we are asked to. I discovered that in an international environment, if you keep silent, you will be ignored. Music is what helps me keep quiet and calm down, especially when I come back from the field.
938	Tala	Syrian Arab Republic	Iraq	M	M	close	890	4146	E	im	female	From Damascus, Tala and her family arrived in Erbil, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, on 16 April 2013. She describes herself as a migrant, and not a refugee, because her family made a collective decision to seek a better life elsewhere. Her family decided to leave Damascus as the conditions in Syria grew more dangerous and life there became more difficult. Her father, while on a business trip to Erbil, decided that the Kurdistan Region of Iraq would be the safest place for Tala, her mother, her two brothers and young sister. I used to study to become a pharmacist, and saw myself becoming a pharmacist. Then, everything changed. Tala came home one night to find her street blocked off by police, firefighters and soldiers. Unable to reach her family, she feared for the worst. Shelling was approaching their area, so her father encouraged her family to leave Syria within the week. The people here in Erbil were really nice to us, she said. They wanted to help us with everything. At first I was depressed, not knowing what to do with my life, but I think Ive coped well. After witnessing the plight of refugees from Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine in her home country of Syria, Tala was inspired to work with those forced from their homes in Iraq. It seemed a natural fit for her – she had worked with refugees in Syria during the 2006 war in Lebanon. Tala joined IOM Iraqs health team to assist in delivering primary health care and tuberculosis treatment for displaced Syrians and Iraqis. She also supported the construction of a health clinic in Shekhan camp, in northern Iraq. She picked this camp as it didnt have any primary health services and the host community around the camp also lacked health clinics and hospitals. It gave me so much joy to know I was able to help people in such a way, she said. Tala would like to keep working in the humanitarian sector. She misses her old life in Syria, and intends to move someday to Beirut, where she sees life as similar to Damascus before the war. Its very hard, being a migrant, she said. I dont have as many options as I had in Syria. You can live your life and think everything is fine, and then theres suddenly a moment where you have to leave.
939	Tanja	Germany	United Kingdom	E	E	close	45909	40718	E	im	female	I was born in Germany and have been living in the UK for six years now. Prior to coming to the UK I lived in New Zealand to do my PhD. My connection with – and deep love for – the UK, however, goes back longer than my arrival in early 2009. I first visited the UK when I was 12 years old and immediately liked it. Its fair to say that I am particularly fond of Scotland, a connection that dates back over 15 years when I first came to Edinburgh to start my voluntary social year, working at a home for people with special needs. I liked it so much that I came back a few years later to continue working there, while also studying at Edinburgh University thanks to an Erasmus scholarship. I would describe myself as an expat German, affinity Scot and European at heart. With a bit of Aotearoa in it to boot. I am deeply concerned about the current political goings on in the UK. Simply put: I am appalled by how the main political parties have jumped upon the populist Ukip bandwagon. What concerns me most is the unacceptable level of hypocrisy in the debate. The tenor appears to be that migration is a problem, but really only with respect to some people. And in any case, it only seems to work one way. So while it is, for instance, a problem for EU migrants to move freely to Britain, it is of course (or so the debate goes) perfectly fine for British people to enjoy the benefits of free movement and retire in Spain or France. Or, for a more personal example: I can no longer count the number of people who have told me but we dont mean you when speaking in ill-chosen terms about immigrants from the EU and elsewhere. Well, thats wrong: I am an immigrant from the EU. And so you are talking about me. What worries me is that migration and, by extension, the EU, has become what I would call an all-purpose easy answer: easily employed in diverse situations to explain, and seemingly offer a solution, to significant problems facing Britain today. From the overburdened NHS to the benefit system and concerns over unemployment, many a politician has begun to default to a response that directly or indirectly relates the issue in question to migrants from Europe. In most of these cases there simply is no evidence to support such claims. It certainly is my firm belief that the majority of the problems Britain faces today have nothing to do with increased levels of migration. Rather, they are the direct result of consecutive years of systematic undermining of both the welfare state and social services – and, by extension, the very fabric of British society. British people have migrated around the world for hundreds of years, have benefited from opportunities abroad, and have made positive and some not so positive contributions in many countries overseas. As a migration historian that much I know for sure. Those employing populist anti-immigration rhetoric would do well reading up on that history. In Britain itself immigrants have made incredibly rich contributions. Let's celebrate these contributions and look at the positive impact immigrants have made. Without it the UK would not be the culturally rich and diverse country it is - and should remain.
940	Tavish	Sri Lanka	Netherlands	I	E	far	3768	53334	H	im	male	Tavish migrated from Sri Lanka to Germany in 1992 and then moved to the Netherlands in 2000, trying to follow his two sisters' footsteps who successfully applied for Asylum. Eleven reception centers and one administrative detention facility later, he's still here. Still with no papers. If I wouldn't have gone to Belgium for two months in 2006, I would have had a residence permit by now, Tavish explains. In 2007, the Netherlands decided to put into effect an amnesty provision legalizing a large group of rejected asylum seekers who had been in the country for a considerable amount of time. Tavish met all the criteria but one: he was not in the country uninterruptedly for more than six years. I was so close to a legal life, Tavish says with a soft voice. He pays regular visits to his two sisters who live in different parts of the country. He increasingly depends on them financially, since it became harder to find a job in the informal economy. In his early fifties, he sometimes feels the pressure to make up his mind: continue life under the radar or start anew in Sri Lanka. I could try to make use of my experience and start my own small Chinese restaurant,  Tavish says. And my mother is almost eighty years old now, so. It was hard to lose my father a few years ago and not being able to attend his funeral.
941	Tayfun	Turkey	United Kingdom	M	E	far	8538	40718	E	im	male	"Tayfun was born in a very small town called Milas in Turkey in 1980. He studied to be a building technician, but he couldnt find a job in the construction industry. You dont have many opportunities in a small town, so I worked in various jobs including travel and automotive industries. Sometimes life forces you to do the things which you didnt dream of, but these days make you stronger. Moreover, it encourages me for new challenges and I decided to move to UK. Two reasons pushed him to leave. Firstly, he saw the country as Wonderland. I remember the pictures of the UK in our English book in primary school. The bridges, the old Victorian houses, the green fields… I had many dreams about these pictures while I was a child. The second reason was that he knew someone who could provide him a job. He believed he could be more productive somewhere else in the world, comparing to Turkey. He left his wife behind and moved to London in 2008. He began to work in a laundromat, where he could work for 5 years because of his visa status. Although he didnt like to work there, he thought it was his only chance to stay in the country. He forced himself not to give up because he already had sacrificed so many other things in life. It wasnt easy to handle all the conditions here, but I promised myself not to go back until I reach my targets. I left my wife behind; I wasnt at the hospital when my daughter was born. After two years, he brought his wife and daughter. At that time, he was really feeling the strain of these extra responsibilities, but he knew he couldnt risk anything. After 5 years, he looked for jobs in a construction company and he began to work. Because of his previous studies, he was quickly promoted within a company, and now he has his own business in the UK. There are very big companies or very small business in construction. But the UK needs mid-level construction support and I want to be one of the leading persons for that. It doesnt matter where you are staying; the feeling of contribution is what matters."
942	Tayyib	Germany	Germany	E	E	close	45909	45909	E	hc	unisex	I am German-Turkish. My grandparents came to Germany in the 1960s as guest workers from Turkey to Germany. For me there was never a question: Am I German or Turkish? Im both. I like both countries. That does not mean that Im happy with all developments within them. Migration is perfectly normal in a globalised world. The world is entangled, for example through the markets. When I did a semester abroad in Hong Kong, I realised that, too. Many colleagues had two backgrounds. There are intercultural marriages, children with different backgrounds. This brings diversity, enriches us, economically, culturally and politically. My mother always made a point of how we had to be good role models, and should not taint the reputation of the German-Turkish community. I think thats right and understandable, but somehow its also sad that I had to behave differently due to my background. The difficulty to see diversity as an enrichment, usually ceases with contacts. I think it would be important to have even more young people spending a part of their education abroad, and not only university students. We as people of different backgrounds can build bridges. For example I am active in advancing German-Turkish dialogue. The relationships arent great on all levels, even though were closely linked: 3 Million people of Turkish descent live in Germany, many Germans spend their holidays in Turkey and we have very close economic ties, however, on the societal level, there is very little contact. I was raised bilingually, and would do that with my children too. Language always created trust. I am astonished when somebody asks us German-Turkish people to integrate ourselves - here, in our home country. I am under the impression that a lot of the debates surrounding integration are dramatized and do not consider the reality of life of the people. But in our democratic system we should speak with people, not about them. I am convinced that my bi-cultural background is helping me understand other cultures and recognise differences more easily. After all, I grew up knowing that there is not only one way of doing things. I hope for Germany that people will be encouraged to use their potentials. Particularly people with a migrational background who have a lot to give to society, the state and the economy. If you live between two societies, you are open-minded and ready to enhance innovation.
943	Temple run	Sierra Leone	Libya	A	A	close	475	4243	H	im	n	Race for Life: Healing Trafficking Survivors in Sierra Leone through Awareness Raising Each year, thousands of young Sierra Leoneans go on temple run to escape poverty and chronic underemployment. They use the services of fraudulent agents who require them to pay big money for fake job or study abroad opportunities. Inspired from the popular mobile phone game, the idiomatic expression temple run describes the risky journey young Sierra Leoneans — some of them victims of trafficking — take through the desert and the sea. In the game, the player endlessly runs, defying various obstacles to escape demons nipping at their heels. There is no end to the journey — except for death — but along the way, the player collects gold coins, that is, if they survive. In 2015, Mariam was a hotel manager in Freetown, Sierra Leones vibrant capital city. She earned 600 000 Leones per month, about 100 USD back then, barely enough to take care of herself and her infant son. One day, she heard from a friend about someone who could give [her] a good job abroad. At the time, I did not know the tactics used by traffickers, she says. They ask desperate youths to give huge sums of money in return for a one-way ticket to a better life, she added. When the opportunity to leave Sierra Leone knocked on her door, she seized it. To fundraise for her journey, Mariam took a 2,500 USD loan from a micro-financing institution. She gave the entire sum to the agent who promised to take her to Australia. She hoped to work for some time and then come back to Sierra Leone to take her son, so they would live together in Australia. Later, Mariam realized she had been duped, and that she had been sold to a family in Kuwait. In Kuwait, Mariam worked without salary for nine months before being sold to another family where the master tried to rape her several times. Eventually, Mariam ran away and sought help from the Sierra Leonean embassy which helped her to return home. Four years later, Mariam, 33, is back in Sierra Leone. As one of the seven outreach staff of the Freetown-based Advocacy Network against Irregular Migration (ANAIM), she has shared her story with many Sierra Leoneans to raise awareness on this risk of falling in the hands of unscrupulous dream merchants. For her, sharing some of the most difficult moments of her life with her peers is a form of healing. Even though sometimes it is difficult, every time I think about my experience, I want to share it with my colleagues who may be tempted to temple run, Mariam says. A Complex and Troubling Issue Apart from the annual report of the US Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, there is little data available on human trafficking practices in Sierra Leone. Evidence of the phenomenon is often hard to come by because of the shame and stigma survivors, especially women face, as well as the difficulty of reporting on such a sensitive topic. Reported cases are hardly prosecuted because the victims often have to travel from remote regions to the capital city to testify at their own cost. Coincidentally, there has been no conviction for trafficking or trafficking-related offenses since 2011. Human trafficking in Sierra Leone is driven by unemployment and underemployment among the countrys youths. More than fifteen years after the civil war destroyed the countrys economy, Sierra Leone has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in Africa. Despite visible economic growth in the past decades, many young Sierra Leoneans are out of work, or like Mariam, they earn barely enough to meet their needs. Families fractured by the 2013–2016 Ebola crisis still struggle to put food on the table and send children to school. The crisis forced the closure of several iron ore mines — Sierra Leones primary export commodity, and the dissolution of many businesses that were suppliers to the mining operations. When an opportunity, especially to go abroad, is presented, most young people seize it because they presume they do not have a better alternative, says Sanusi Tejan Savage, Head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Office in Sierra Leone. The ambiguity of human trafficking also means that sometimes, people do not know that they are being trafficked, or that what they are doing is a form of trafficking. Sending a child from a rural town to live and work with a next-of-kin in an urban or work-intensive area is common practice for many families, explains Savage. What we see as a form of child trafficking, families see it as a way to increase their income, he adds. Raising Awareness When she returned to Sierra Leone, Mariam joined the Advocacy Network against Irregular Migration, an association formed by a returned migrant, Sheku Bangura, who had attempted unsuccessfully to reach Europe through Libya. In the premises of the association located in the Eastern area of Freetown, registration certificates and pictures from past outreach events hang on the wall. More than 1,400 Sierra Leoneans including survivors of trafficking stranded in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, have returned with IOMs assistance since November 2017 in the framework of the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration. Sheku was one of them. After six difficult months in Libya, he gave up on his dream to travel to Europe and decided to return home in an IOM chartered flight from Tripoli. He founded ANAIM with his reintegration grant, hoping to help other young Sierra Leoneans not fall into the trap of deceitful smugglers and traffickers. Since its founding, the ANAIM has become a safe space where returned migrants and survivors of human trafficking can hope to find support. The association is self-funded so Sheku pays for all the expenses related to outreach activities from his salary as a teacher. We went through similar experiences, so we rely on each other for both moral, emotional and sometimes material support, Sheku explains. Being part of the association helped me get through difficult times, admits Mariam. I hope my story will inspire others and help change their minds. In Sierra Leone, IOM strengthens the technical capacity of identified governmental, non-governmental and civil society partners to help survivors of human trafficking.

I am thinking of opening a shop in my ward and work only here in my native town as there is no shop.  All my friends are working here. It costs about 20 Lakhs (around $1,500 USD). I will still need to learn for about a year before I am fully competent. My father doesnt like my transitioning. In front of my father I have to appear like a man. My mother accepts me. Here the teacher explains everything in detail and I also used to work at my friends shop before I attended the training where I learnt some basic knowledge on how to dye and straighten hair, but here I can learn more detailed techniques. I can also use some of the techniques I learn here for my transition. If I wear like a lady I look more beautiful. Here there are not many people who have transitioned but in Yangon, (Myanmars largest capital city) there are some famous people who have fully transitioned.
945	Thant	Myanmar	Myanmar	I	I	close	1292	1292	E	hc	male	Since my childhood, I had wanted to be a medical doctor who could save the lives of people and promote health education, especially for vulnerable people. Soon after graduating from university I worked in an international organization as a medical doctor where I was posted in Rakhine State assisting with emergency rescue during a period of conflict. During this time I became very interested in public health. Working in Bogale for IOM has been a great experience. We work well coordinating with the township health department to improve maternal and child health, to raise community awareness of health issues and in building the capacity of auxiliary mid-wives, community health workers and village health tract committees. Part of this role includes mainstreaming gender issues into health policy. Im proud to serve the community through my work. I think we need to look beyond the numbers of maternal deaths. Its so sad that many family members may be left without care of a mother or a wife. It encourages me to be a part of the maternal and child health project to support womens lives through health care. Providing training to volunteer health workers was a real highlight as they are people from community who want to make a difference. Having the chance to work closely with these people, to learn from their experiences and to understand the strength of their communities was really powerful. It also gave me a chance to motivate them to learn about health related activities but also to empower the women to contribute to their communities. I believe that in most professional settings in Myanmar men have fewer barriers to succeed than women. In our culture, most people think that men are more trustful and have stronger leadership and decision making skills. But I believe that it depends on the individual, not on gender. I think, in Myanmar, we still need to improve womens rights. In all sectors, if there are equal rights for all human beings such as equality of income, opportunities and conditions, it will lead to development of the country. I think in Myanmar, its easier for a man to get a job than a woman, so in a family, women become dependent financially on the man and can lead to less equality. It becomes a tradition in Myanmar, not everywhere, but especially in rural areas. In this respect I think women must empower themselves so that we are not vulnerable.
946	Thao	Viet Nam	United States	I	N	far	2786	63123	H	im	female	When I first came here I was in fourth grade, I didn't speak any English and I felt I didn't belong to my school and to any new places. I was homesick for a while until after two years or so, said Thao, who arrived in the United States with her parents and brother in 2008 from Vietnam where she was born. My dad used to work for the United States Army Force at the time of the Vietnam War. They [the United States] offered him to come here after the war because he served in their army, but he first didn't want to. After he got married and he had me and my brother, he realized that we didn't have enough money to afford the school over there so we had to come here for better opportunities and a better life, she said. Thaos goal is to pursue a career as a psychologist, to learn about people's behavior. By then she will become a United States citizen. I am going to take the citizenship test next summer, she said with a big smile on her face. When I came here I learned about new morals, and I have learned more about life than when I was in Vietnam. When I was in Vietnam, I felt I was trapped into something, it was hard. Here it is freer and you can do whatever you want and speak up for yourself. I knew none of that in Vietnam, said Thao as she stood among a large crowd asking for justice and equality for all individuals regardless of citizenship and race at the National Mall in Washington,
947	The People of Magnem Care Center	Papua New Guinea	Papua New Guinea	I	I	close	2640	2640	E	hc	n	Within eyeshot of the active volcanic island of Manam is the Magnem Care Centre, found along the mainland shore. Those living at the Care Centers consist of Abaria, Boakure, Dugulaba and Warisi communities who originally inhabited the island of Manam. Our home was a beautiful place. The island itself was not very big. You could walk around it in a single day. The former residents of Manam Island can trace back their heritage on the island as far back as 1515 when the island was first discovered and was already inhabited. We have a strong connection with this place. Our parents and ancestors lived their entire lives there and we were supposed to do the same. Life for all of Manams inhabitants drastically changed in 2005 when the islands volcano erupted on a scale never seen before. In the past, whenever the volcano erupted, the lava and ash fall would come out of only one of its two openings. That meant that only half of the island would be affected so communities would escape to the other side until it was safe to return. Then one day, in 2005, the volcano erupted so violently that both openings spewed lava and ash which covered the entire island. Everyone had to leave. Since then, a number of communities from the island were relocated to various Care Centers consisting of borrowed land allocated for the newly arriving IDPs. Despite the relocation assistance that they had received, they arrived to an under developed centre. We were dropped off in the rain and there were no tarpaulins set up. Nothing was prepared. We had to build shelters in the rain on the first day. We used to grow coconuts, breadfruit, mangoes, lemons, chestnuts, taro, bananas, cassava, and fish. Back on Manam, we had everything we needed to live and prosper. If we wanted to build houses, we could use the bamboo that was available, if we wanted to cook meals, we harvested the fruits from our gardens and fish from the sea for food. But now, we cant do many of these things and its not enough to support our growing communities. Sometimes, we cannot grow enough food here for everyone so we have to travel further out and steal from gardens and plants that do not belong to us. We dont want to do this but we have no choice. Tensions have slowly risen over the last decade between the various IDPs of Manam islands and nearby host communities. Often these tensions can turn into violent clashes. Everything is different now. We can no longer live in our normal ways. Instead of harvesting our food to eat, we sometimes have to sell it for money because our coconuts are more valuable being sold than consumed. Our women and young men have started to leave the care centers to look for work deeper in the mainland. Many say they do it because they want to find other ways to survive and contribute to the community. I was just a baby when I was on the island so I only really remember growing up here. My parents tell me about how life was like back on the island but I dont think we will ever go back. I want to go out and find a job. I want to be able to provide for myself. As the community continues to strive to make ends meet while living on borrowed land through whatever means necessary, it is clear that the lives of former residents of Manam Island have been forever changed by its powerful and devastating volcano.
948	The Returnees of Manam Island	Papua New Guinea	Papua New Guinea	I	I	close	2640	2640	E	hc	n	"While all of the former residents of Manam Island fled the powerful eruption of the islands volcano in 2005 only a select few had dared to return to the island. Over the past decade, several communities had tried to adjust to the various living conditions at the Care Centers found in Madang. As most have managed to survive the various lifestyle changes they encountered at these sites, a select few have made the conscious decision to leave the sites and return to their active volcanic homeland. This place will always be our home. says Michael, a resident from Baliau, one of two communities that have since returned to the active island. Like the others, the community of Baliau had lived in one of the Care Centers for years trying to survive and encountered the similar hardships as those in Mangem and Potdsdam Care Centers. Those issues included rising tension with nearby host communities for essential resources. Six years after the eruption of the Manem Island Volcano, tensions between the people of Baliau and host communities reached a breaking point resulting in violence including the death of six people, of which four were from Baliau. The deaths proved to be the turning point for the community and what followed was the long transition returning to their home and rebuilding their lives in the ashes of their old ones. Upon arrival their homeland bared little resemblance to what they left behind. Everything was covered in ash, especially the gardens. You could grow nothing on it. It took us an entire year to clear up the land and remove the volcanic ash and rock before we can start growing foods again. In addition to their struggles in tilling the land, the community of Baliau arrived to the island also to find that public services including schools were completely abandoned. Even though we face even worse hardships here than before the eruption, we respect this land as well as the land of the other communities who have not returned back home. Despite being one of the few communities to have returned to Manam, the community has not actually expanded its territory to use land formerly used by neighbouring communities. We were taught not to use what does not belong to us. This is one of the reasons why we had to leave the mainland. The community tries to regain a semblance of normality in the face of all such hardships; however, it is undeniable that the community continues to exist within dangerous proximity to an active volcano as it continues to spew out large plumes visible from the mainland, a haunting reminder of the threat they face. We often feel some small rumbling and see the large smoke coming from the top but we are no longer nervous. We have no other land; we have seen what happens trying to live on what does not belong to us. Knowing that we have no other option anymore, we will accept our fate if it erupts again."
949	Théophile	Democratic Republic of the Congo	Democratic Republic of the Congo	A	A	close	506	506	E	hc	male	My name is Théophile, I was supported by a Belgian professor who lived in Kinshasa at the time when I lost my parents. I was living with my brother but he did not have the means to support both of us. When the Professor returned to Belgium, he asked me to come there. I lived and studied in Brussels. After school, I decided that it was not necessary to stay there too long because I could not find a job. Having received an offer of employment here in DRC, I decided to go back and so far it has been good. Belgium is my second home, but I think there are difficulties there for both new African migrants and those who have already been integrated. Migration is a normal thing. Today when I go to Europe as an African, I can bring what others do not. Therefore, we should not put up a lot of barriers. The barriers that people put up are used mainly to protect their own interests, but I think we must all have integration. When the Belgians came to the Congo in the past, many of them did not want to go back. It was a political situation that had pushed them away. I think that today we have to promote the free movement of persons.
950	Thom	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	male	I left my home country of the United States to become an international student in Dublin, Ireland in 1999. I was 25 years old. I thought it would be an exciting experience and deepen my studies. I moved to Britain in 2001 completing my PhD by 2004. I have worked full-time in the UK since. I had a wonderful time as a student and thoroughly enjoy my work in the UK. I miss three things in no particular order: Philly cheesesteaks, French vanilla coffee and Dunkin Donuts' cinnamon rolls. I miss family and friends even more. Integration is too often seen as a one-way street where all the responsibility or blame falls on migrants. I want to see a shift in opinion that accepts that it takes two to integrate - with responsibilities on new members and their communities alike. I've made numerous errors getting wrong what things are called in Britain. When asked to buy some tomato sauce, I brought home a bottle of, well, tomato sauce like Ragu. I found out that in the North East of England 'tomato sauce' means 'ketchup' (and sauce for pasta dishes is called 'pasta sauce'). I persuaded no one when I pointed out that ketchup says ketchup and the jar of Ragu in my hands did say 'tomato sauce'. Strange! At first, I didn't think the leap would too great from the US to Ireland and from Ireland to the UK. An easy mistake for someone to make who hadn't done it. Now that I've lived in all three countries I better appreciate their differences. They can be hard to anticipate - even where there is a common language, similar common law tradition, etc. My original plan was to succeed as an academic following a traditional academic pathway. This changed because of my first-hand experiences as a migrant. Navigating my way through visa applications was a mess. Few seemed to have any clear understanding of the rules. While everyone in the media seems to think there are few regulations, the truth is there is a tsunami of rules that seemed designed to keep people out by tricking them on some technicality. It's no way to run an immigration system fit for purpose. I'm strongly committed to becoming a visible voice for migrants, as someone who made it through to becoming a British citizen, to counter misinformation and expose myths, but also to drive necessary and long overdue changes that will make the system work much better. I think I bring skills and experiences from my field that enrich and develop my workplaces and communities. Knowing how things can work elsewhere is useful for showing new possibilities that may not be apparent to others. I worry about what the current president-elect will do. America is not the open society and land of opportunity it once was. I see the UK as much more of that kind of place. My home is here in Britain, not in the USA.
951	Thu	Thailand	Myanmar	I	I	close	7189	1292	L	im	female	"Around a week by foot, quips Thu, describing how long his journey from Myanmar to Thailand took. Like many others fleeing violence in Myanmar, Thu narrates a journey of climbing mountains and navigating jungles to reach Thailand from the Tanintharyi region, just across the border. As a teenager with his mother, he found the Tham Hin refugee camp in 2007, via a friends suggestion. The camp hosts thousands of ethnic Karen and Burmese refugees, many of whom have been living there for a decade. Thu explains that a never-ending spiral of violence and poverty were the main reasons he left Myanmar. At Tham Hin, he finally had the opportunity to do what he had always wanted to—study. Enrolling in vocational school, he picked up engineering skills that were sought-after in the community. This landed him a job with an international organization in Thailand, which recruited him to maintain security and janitorial services in its Tham Hin office. Comparing his life in Myanmar to his life now, he says Thailand is much better and more peaceful. After having settled in the camp, Thu eventually met his wife, who works as a part-time tailor for the residents of Tham Hin. They are expecting a child, he announces with a grin on his face, happy that the community library for children is right beside their home. In October 2016, a family of six refugees returned from Tham Hin to Myanmar—the first voluntary repatriation to be endorsed by both countries governments. As part of his job, Thu assisted the family in their preparations for moving. Although, Thu says firmly that he does not wish to follow suit and return to Myanmar. Instead, he hopes to be resettled to a third country; specifically, the United States, where his mother has been living the past two years. When asked what he hopes for his future and that of the camp, Thu pauses to think, then proceeds to say good luck—a simple, yet very meaningful answer for the residents of Tham Hin."
952	Thuan	Viet Nam	United States	I	N	far	2786	63123	H	im	male	It was in 1979 that Thuan left on a refugee boat from Vietnam, a country torn by a two-decade long war. On the 60-meter boat were 10-year old Thuan, his mother, a young brother, and about 370 other people, with no life jackets. When they landed in Malaysia, Thuan and his family were rejected as refugees. Unwilling to go back to war-ravaged Vietnam, Thuans mother decided to take her two kids on another boat, to the island of Letung in Indonesia, where they spent 10 months. The young Thuan used to swim to the nearby town to buy candies. His mother would then sell those candies in the refugee colony to earn bread for her kids. We used to make 10 cents of profit a day, and that would be a luxury. We could buy fresh fish, recalls Thuan, who is now the chief technology officer of Uber. Going back to the story of how he made it out of Vietnam, Thuan says there was just a 50:50 chance of survival in those boat journeys across oceans. During the journeys, Thuan and his family were pirated twice. We would not panic. In fact we would be calm and surrender ourselves. Thats the way a startup journey is. Even if you lose all one day, you can build all over again if you retain your calm. After landing in Indonesia, Thuans mother applied for asylum in the US. The familys application was approved and they landed in Maryland, where his mother worked as a ledger keeper at a gas station during day. In evening, she would work as a grocery packer at a supermarket. Thuan was enrolled in a school in the US. On weekends he would work at a car wash station. He used to wear donated clothes and shoes. I remember wearing girl socks for almost two years in oblivion, until someone pointed. Thuan was admitted to a bachelors program of computer science at MIT in 1986, and graduated in 1991, when the internet was just emerging. I strongly encourage aspiring entrepreneurs to educate themselves, even if they dont wish to graduate. College education opens doors for you, he says.
953	Thys	South Africa	Belarus	A	E	far	5094	6377	E	im	male	Thys and his wife Antonette moved from South Africa to Belarus in 1994 as Christian missionaries. They didnt realize at first what post-Soviet country they would move to. But they happened to get to a missionary camp in a small town of Kobrin. Later on Thys and his wife moved to Pruzhany, where they live now. We came here without knowing a single word of Russian. We didnt have a cultural shock because we were living in a camp with Americans and Germans who helped us integrate a lot. I can say that we were put in favorable conditions to get adapted to a new country. Therefore, our move to Belarus wasnt a nightmare for us, but rather an exciting adventure. When we first arrived, I didnt notice any huge differences between South African cuisine and Belarusian cuisine. My wife did. For example, unlike most Belarusians we dont eat our meal with bread. At home we often used to grill steaks on fire, and here we try to keep this tradition but the weather doesnt always allow it. South Africa has an ideal climate, but after years here I have changed my attitude and now I think that 10 degrees below zero is also a good weather! Since 2000, we have our own farm with 250 sheep and pigs. We also had a café called Africa for a few years. But running this type of business wasnt our cup of tea and we decided to close it, although we had received great support from the local authorities. We speak English, Russian and Afrikaans. We talk to each other in Afrikaans, but then we switch to Russian, without even noticing it. I can now say that Belarus is my home. I believe that your home is where you dont feel like a guest, but rather like you belong. Nobody has treated us like foreigners here. On the contrary it is me who always tries to remind myself that I am a foreigner in this country and it is my duty to integrate into the society where I live.  Why do people migrate? I think there should be a serious reason for migration. In our case it was a Christian mission. Moving to another country out of curiosity, I think, is not wise. Anyway, the world has already become a small place.

This is a place where I have never imagined that I would live, and so far it has been an experience I will never forget. I was so excited to come here because it was a professional and personal challenge. Everything was new for me: house, job, environment, etc. Before coming I had tried to imagine how it would be, but it is better than I ever thought. I have been working for IOM for almost 10 years. I have spent a year in Niger working as a Resource Management Officer. Before that I was in the Philippines. There, the culture, climate and food are similar to Thailand, but here everything is so different. One of the main obstacles I have faced here is the language. Yet, there are other ways to communicate, and I am connected with people not only by language. They are kind and generous and they know that I am still learning French and that I cannot speak it yet, so they make a great effort to understand and help me. But there is a benefit in the fact that I do not speak French, because then they must practice their English. I feel proud to work with my Nigerien colleagues. Some of them have never been in another country and I have the chance to share with them different perspectives from abroad. I also learn a lot from them, for they are happy to share things with me. I have been to two weddings to which they invited me. It is so different and interesting. First we go to the brides house, then to the grooms house and in the evening there is a party. The girls and women of the brides family dress up with dresses made out of tissues with the same pattern. Next they want to take me to a Tabaski, a traditional ceremony with the sacrifice of goats or sheep.

I abandoned my studies after level CM1, due to a lack of financial resources; my parents are from the countryside and their financial situation could not permit me to continue my education. Many of my friends spoke about the gold mines in Chad, so I thought to myself it would be good to at least take a chance. So, I crossed the border by foot to work in the mines. Despite the harsh conditions, I persevered because my future depended on it. After two weeks, the military arrived and told us we must disperse, and I returned empty-handed. Now, I hope to restart my studies, and one day become a nurse to save lives."

Ive completed each of my degrees in a different country, and found this not only to enrich my studies but also the way I learn, think, and see the people around me. This journey one day brought me to Switzerland where I now live and work. Ive found myself saying a few times this is the place I will stay - but I seem to remember saying that in a few other countries as well. To me being a migrant means being a citizen of the world; my experiences around the world contribute to the person I am, and I bring my unique mindset to each new place that I go. I sincerely hope that I am able to make a small impact on the mindset of others who are constantly impacting my own, and I hope things are clearer and brighter for the world that lays ahead of us. The more I interact with friends and new acquaintances here, the more I realize the world is much smaller than we realize. And we therefore all have a lot in common."

The money to go to South Africa came from my uncle. I asked them to gived me the money to go to university instead but they said no, that I should first come and work in order to support the others. On my way, I spent one month in Kenya and Tanzania, and then eight months in prison in Malawi because I had entered the country illegally. I would not migrate again because I saw many problems like hunger; some of the people died during the journey and I do not want to go in such a way. Irregular migration is not recommended. Even my elder brother wanted to migrate to South Africa but because of my experience, he has decided not to go. I am raising awareness in the community regarding the bad aspects of migration. IOM helped me return to Ethiopia in December 2017. They helped me with transportation right up to my hometown, and gave me clothes. When I came back, I opened a shop to sell things like soft drinks, soap and pasta. The sign outside my shop says 'No credit this week' because I lost money by giving people credit. In my area, there was no such shop like this before, if people wanted soft drinks they would have to go to the city. So by looking at what was missing here, I selected this business. Since there are no similar shops around here I will expand this business to other cities like Hosanna and become a wholesale distributor. *Tigists father helped him rent accommodation and start the shop; through the EUTF he will receive soft drinks for distribution."

I was born in Germany and despite all the comforts of living in a place I knew well, with people I knew, I decided to discover new horizons and moved first to Greece, Britain and Belgium. In Brussels, I met my future wife who was visiting from the Netherlands where she was based at the time. As she is Slovenian, we got married in Piran, Slovenia and we had 13 different nationalities at our wedding. I feel I belong to Brussels now. I am a strong supporter of the European project - I have even focused my career around it- and I enjoy the cosmopolitan nature of the city. My experience has been made easy by one of the EU's greatest achievements; the freedom of movement. This gave me the privilege to share lifestyles from Belgium, Greece, Britain, Slovenia and Germany - an experience that made me who I am and for which I'm immensely grateful. I cannot imagine what most migrants have to endure to get a chance of what I took for granted for a very long time. Should my wife and I have children, we wish for them that they have even more freedom in a more open society, meet people from different backgrounds, have more opportunities to live and work anywhere their skills are needed and where they want to live. Move freely and come together, thats what I wish people could do."

In Madagascar, I was not able to provide for my family. In 1999, hearing about an opportunity to work in Mauritius I decided to take the plunge. Moving abroad seemed like the only option, but even that required some money, including paying for my passport and a medical certificate fees. My family contributed by selling some of their possessions in order to give me the chance to go to Mauritius. Ever since then, giving back has been my main goal. I am now employed at Wensum Company, a high-end Mauritian textile manufacturer producing upmarket suits distributed through boutique shops worldwide that dress celebrities such as Prince Harry of Wales. I learned Mauritian Creole and a little English, because it was a necessity in order to work properly. I used to live in a dorm close to the company site with other Malagasy employees before moving with my husband to a separate house. In 2008, I became pregnant with my son. I named him Messi in honor of the famous Argentinean football player. My whole family in Madagascar is passionate about football. My son is a fast learner and is gifted in languages and music, I am very proud of him and my new born little girl. In 2013, not having returned to Madagascar since my departure, I requested leave to visit my family. My father passed away two days after my arrival. It was terribly sad but I needed to be strong for my family. As a migrant, I think you should always look to the future, seize opportunities abroad, but never forget your family. Giving back to the ones you love and who helped you definitely comes first.

My parents met in Tamu – a turbulent town on the Myanmar-India border in 1986 – and later married. Marriage between different ethnic groups was rare at the time, but my parents defied convention. I was born in Tamu in 1993, and spent the first nine years of my life there. We had 14 dogs at our house, which I later learned were there to protect us from the thieves that regularly tried to break in. I often heard gunfire as a child – fighting between the local rebel group Manipur and the Border Security Force – but I didnt realize that was unusual. Life in Tamu was all I knew. I still cherish the childhood I had there. When I was nine, my parents decided that it was too dangerous to stay in Tamu. My father travelled to Yangon, the capital of Myanmar. He found a house and sent for the rest of our family to join him there. Since the day we left for Yangon, I have never returned to Tamu, and there are many aspects of it – my friends, our home and local delicacies – that I still miss. Once in Yangon, my two sisters and I became immersed in our studies. My parents had high expectations of us, and I had promised them from a young age that I would eventually pursue a doctorate. This was especially important to my mother, who never had the opportunity to go to university. In 2009, my mother, grandmother and eldest sister moved to Bangkok, Thailand. I joined them one year later to pursue my dream of higher education. My father stayed behind Yangon (he doesnt like travelling), and its hard being away from him. I try to talk to him every day; my sisters, mom, grandmother and I take turns going back so that he doesnt get lonely. I studied Thai when I arrived in Bangkok. It wasnt easy, but Ive found that being able to communicate has helped me adapt to our new home and better understand Thailands culture. Im also volunteering at the Bangkok Art & Cultural Centre, where my knowledge of Myanmar, Nepali and Chinese, English and Thai comes in handy! There are lots of differences between life in Yangon and Bangkok, the most notable being electricity. When I left Yangon, there were still regular power cuts. It was incredible arriving in Bangkok and finding that there was always electricity at home. Looking ahead, Im hoping to work for a few years before beginning my doctorate. I havent decided where to go yet, but I might return to Yangon, so I can spend time with my father. Im also considering studying in the United States, but my mom told me that I can only go if one of my sisters goes with me. I feel blessed to have already had the opportunity to live and learn in two different countries, and excited for the journey the future holds."

His craftsmanship is evident from looking around the area where he lives with his wife and children, like the handmade, intricately woven wood and grass chicken coup.

I am looking forward to the new part of the work, which will be making furniture, said Toak, while sitting in a handmade bamboo chair, a prototype for the ones he will make for camp residents in the coming months, along with beds.

962	Tony	Syrian Arab Republic	Canada	M	N	far	890	43560	H	im	male	"Im Tony, and this is my wife Maha and son Habib. Before the war, everything was normal in Syria. I worked in a church-restaurant for over ten years and life was good. We were surrounded by family and friends. That was when people still liked and trusted each other. Then the bombs began to fall. And then to make matters worse, Daesh came to Syria. They dont differentiate between Muslims and Christians—they just kill and destroy whomever they dont like. So, Maha and I fled to Lebanon after we got married four years ago. Maha hasnt been able to see her family in several years. All the roads have been cut off—things are really bad there. Her family has never even seen Habib. Life in Lebanon has been hard because working here is difficult. We are really looking forward to the peace and security that Canada can offer. Were really happy to be going, and weve heard Canadians are really nice. Even though our families are still in Syria, we are ready to make a life in Canada, one that will give Habib the opportunity to live in a safe, stable place. Maha and I want Canadians to know that we are like them; we can work and be productive too. All we want is a peaceful life."
963	Tony	Syrian Arab Republic	Croatia	M	E	far	890	13934	H	im	male	Tony fled Syria in 2011 because he did not want to join the army and participate in the conflicts. He departed to Lebanon where he spent a few years but the living conditions were not satisfying, in 2015 he decided to leave to try reach Europe. He embarked on a plane to Turkey but got imprisoned upon arrival. After spending six days in jail he was transferred to a camp. He managed to leave Turkey after ten days and was smuggled in a boat to Macedonia. Tony fought to survive and reach the Macedonian coast when the boat turned over mid sea, he lost all his belongings but saved his life.  After walking a whole night he arrived to the borders of Serbia and pushed through his journey to Croatia. Tony rested for a few days in Croatia then left again to Hungary and then to Austria where he asked for asylum. Unfortunately, his request was refused and he was deported back to Croatia in April 2016. He didn't lose hope and to no despair applied for asylum in Croatia and is currently waiting for his second interview, hoping to settle in the country and seek his second chance at life.
964	Torbjorn	Norway	United Kingdom	E	E	close	66871	40718	E	im	male	I was born in Oslo, Norway in 1971 and came to the UK in 1993 to take my first degree at Imperial College, London. I continued to do a PhD at Bristol University and then became a Computer Science Lecturer at the University of South Wales and later the University of Plymouth. I have helped hundreds of students get degrees and jobs by teaching modules on computer technologies and software development. I have been the manager for a range of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. I have helped develop new computing programs in several UK universities. In 2004 I founded the Cognitive Robotics Research Centre at the University of South Wales and I have helped bring millions of Euros worth of research funding to the UK from Europe. I have published conference and journal articles in international fora and represented the UK at international conferences. I have supervised research students and helped transfer cutting edge technology from UK universities to UK industry. In 1996 I met my English wife and in 1999 we got married. Together we have raised three children, two dogs and countless cats and chickens.
965	Tran Thi	Viet Nam	United Kingdom	I	E	far	2786	40718	H	im	female	I came to Germany when I was 14 years old. My mum and brother had already been there for 4 years when my dad and I could finally join them. I will always remember the day I had to wave my mother goodbye at the airport. It was heart-breaking! But four years later, we had our happy family reunion. I have always dreamed of becoming a successful woman. And Germany made it happen. Although it was difficult to integrate and adapt at the beginning, mostly because of the language barrier and the numerous uncomfortable questions people asked me that made me feel like a social misfit - So, you are immigrant? Why did your parents come here? Do you now have German citizenship? Do you feel more German or Vietnamese? - I have worked hard to integrate into the society and I am now studying electrical engineering in a German university. My family is extremely loving and supportive. I am glad they taught me great values. Thanks to them, I give and share without expecting in return. It doesn't matter where you are from or where you live because true love should come from the heart and has no border. If you ask me whether I feel more German or Vietnamese, I will answer I just feel loved. It took me a while but now I am proud to say: I am a migrant.
966	Turpal	Russian Federation	Russian Federation	O	O	close	10166	10166	E	hc	male	In July 2015, after having spent 10 months in Austria, Turpal decided to voluntarily return from Austria to his hometown Grozny in the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation. I had the necessary work experience. From the very start, this business provided me with a steady source of income. Currently I am doing small renovations in my parents house and making a separate room for myself. I would like to get married and become totally independent from my parents. Turpal was also very keen on acquiring further education. He visited a business training organized by IOM and received financial support for attending a book keeping course. But Turpals thirst for knowledge was not yet quenched– he used a part of the EUR 500 cash grant to travel to Pyatigorsk in order to enroll in university for a distance learning course in Information Systems and Technologies. Turpal has no doubts that his decision to return to the Chechen Republic was the right one. When I was in Austria I missed my parents, relatives and friends the most. Now I understand that Grozny is my home. Once he had decided to return, Turpal registered for IOMs reintegration project RESTART'*. Turpal decided to invest his reintegration assistance in purchasing necessary tools for a tire fitting shop. *Reintegration Assistance for Voluntary Returnees to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Russian Federation/Chechen Republic, (co-funded by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund of the European Union). Within the framework of this project, he received a EUR 500 cash grant and in-kind assistance of around EUR 2,800 for income generating activities.
967	Usman	Uzbekistan	Russian Federation	I	O	far	1724	10166	H	im	male	My name is Usman. Currently, I live and work in Moscow. I was born in Uzbekistan and moved with my family to Russia about three years ago. I came to Moscow because I wanted to have more opportunities for personal development. Here, there are many more possibilities than back home, so here I am. All my life I wanted to start a business which would make people happier. In Moscow, I managed to do exactly that and opened a small zoo for kids. In the beginning, it was not easy.  When I was trying to get my business off the ground, I had to deal with fraudsters who tried to cheat me. At the same time, I met a lot of good people, who sincerely tried to help me. One of them was a Russian lady. She helped me with opening and registering my current business. By bringing somebody else into the business, I knew that I was taking some risks. However, I saw that this person also sincerely wanted to create a place where families with kids could come and spend time having fun and interacting with animals. Quite soon, she became my real business partner. I trusted my heart and took some risks.  Now, I know that it was the right decision and it helped me to make my dream come true. Moscow is a very big city. There are a lot of newcomers, migrants from other countries, and people from other parts of Russia as well. There are a lot of languages spoken in Moscow, Russian and English seem to be the most popular. I feel very comfortable and safe in Moscow and I freely communicate with people who live here. When my kids grow up, they will go to school here in Moscow and will have the opportunity to get a good education.  As for myself, in the future, I see myself as a happy and successful person. I have met a lot of people of different nationalities in my life. I believe there are no bad nationalities, but just bad people. It is not fair to judge the whole nation by the actions of one person. Therefore, when anyone says that migrants from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan are bad, this is simply a prejudice. It may be a result of cultural misunderstanding. We need to try to get to know more about each other, to better understand each other. We all should try to trust each other and not be afraid of people whose nationality or culture is different from our own. My personal life experience tells me that the world is built on mutual trust and kindness, no matter where you live and no matter which nationalities are the people around you.

968	Vadim	Ukraine	United States	E	N	far	3557	63123	H	im	male	Its a human instinct to make judgments on everything we dont know. The lack of interactions makes us have presumptions that aren't true.   I was born in Ukraine, Odessa in 1977. I enjoyed the last drops of Soviet education as a musician and young child interested in physics and math. It took me a long time to decide what to do in life considering the big difference between my two passions for music and physics. So I studied physics at the University of Odessa and music at the Conservatory at the same time. Then came the 90s when peoples savings turned into nothing. My father had dedicated his life as an engineer developing different infrastructures for the Soviet Union and suddenly he realized he had no money to feed us. Were a Jewish family that experienced some anti-semitism. Personally  I faced it minimally as a child but I dont consider myself a victim. My father though, faced it for many years. In 1995, my family applied for a German visa as refugees. Germany, at the time, was accepting two main migrant streams: those ethnic Germans sent to Kazakhstan by the Soviet Union  and Ukrainian/Russian Jewish migrants. We were the latter. I was 17 when I came to Germany. Although it wasnt really my decision as I was following my family, I was still very excited to go to Germany and was given the opportunity to tour the country as a young composer. My parents didnt really want me to go to a music school at first but my mums colleagues – she was also a composer and pianist – discovered me and asked me to come and study at the conservatory. I currently live in New York. I teach jazz, piano and composition in Boston Massachusetts. I travel all over the world with my music. On one hand I feel at home in the United States, but I also consider Germany my home. Sometimes I cant even believe I became the person I am today. I grew up as a Russian speaking Ukrainian Jew, and I still check every single morning the news to see whats going on in Ukraine and Russia. My cultural identity hasnt really changed. This makes me think that of course I am a migrant, Im a result of the different travel experiences and different life experiences I faced. We form our ideas from different pespectives not always having a firm foundation for them. Similarly, people think about migrants based on their judgments without the necessary evidence. I suppose its a human instinct to make judgments on everything we know and dont know. With migration being a broad topic, the lack of information and interactions makes us have presumptions about migrants that arent necessarily true.
969	Valdis	Latvia	Estonia	E	E	close	17871	23106	E	im	male	In 2007 I came to Estonia to study. I usually dont refer to those years as being here permanently, because it was more like visiting here from Latvia. I planned on playing pool professionally and eventually moving to Germany and devoting myself to my hobby. That stopped being the plan after I met the woman of my dreams, to whom I proposed to two months after we started dating. I got a job right after that and a year later we had our son. Everything completely changed within a year. I can say that since 2010 I have been permanently living in Estonia. After getting married and becoming a father, Ive experienced a lot of personal growth. Today little remains from my old personality and I can proudly say that I have developed a lot of new, good traits. I feel a somewhat better sense of belonging here in Estonia. This country has provided me with everything an individual can wish for to live a happy and prosperous life – education, family, job, social security, inclusion. Culturally and socially the difference between Latvians and Estonians is not very big. I think this society is more accepting of me because we come from a similar historical background, where we share the pain and sorrow of the past and freedom from the present. In small countries, like Latvia and Estonia, this is a pivotal point that unites people. As a foreigner I had experienced discomfort when I went on a student exchange program to Cyprus. I was living in a neighbourhood where foreigners were not commonly seen so the people gazed at me wherever I went. But that was just in the beginning because they had never seen me before. Then I really understood what people may feel when they are pointed out because of their different cultural background, race, behavior or because they have a physical disability. This feeling of exclusion and alienation sticks around and the sense of not feeling welcome remains. Back then I was in someone else's shoes and that reaffirmed my approach towards people - no matter how you look, behave or speak, its about being humane and understanding. Treat another human being as you would like to be treated. We dont even realise what an impact media has on our views and lives. Studies abroad here in Estonia and my current job have convinced me that its important to listen to peoples stories who have been around as opposed to feeding off the mainstream media propaganda. The fact that someone leaves their comfort zone, their own home and moves to another country shows that she/he is already open to new experiences and new challenges. Its up to the local community to show these people a sense of belonging and acceptance. I work for Transferwise and its amazing that we have people from all over the world working in one place, for one cause.
970	Valentine	Belgium	Germany	E	E	close	45028	45909	E	im	male	I came to Germany for work – after I graduated, it was very difficult to find a job in Belgium. But I had a Masters degree and two internships under my belt, so I thought it was unfair to work again as an unpaid intern. The compromise with myself was only to do that if I could gain more than just added work experience in my own field of expertise. Berlin was a good option: Here I could improve my German and English, get a scholarship and work in my field. I really like it here, but I dont think Ill stay forever. Life is at the same time beautiful and hard here - everything is relatively cheap, but also wages are very low. There are many people, especially in the cultural sector, who think it normal to work for free, and many people who take advantage of that. Also I dont think that, as a non-native speaker of German, Ill be able to have a proper career here. What I always found really attractive here is the freedom. Everyone can be who they want. But sometimes I feel German culture is too individualistic. I have learned from that a little bit to put myself first more often, and that was an important lesson, but sometimes I still find it hard to live like that. It is sad that consideration and friendliness are so rare. At the end of the day, I believe that my ideas of living in a community are just very different. I am and will always be Belgian. That is my story and my background. But on another, very personal level, it was important for me to be away from home for a while. Berlin was and still is the perfect place for me, to cut my own path. For that Im very grateful.
971	Valeria	México	United Kingdom	L	E	far	8326	40718	E	im	female	"I arrived to the UK initially to carry out a post-graduate degree in 2001, but I decided to proceed with my doctoral studies. During that time I met my current husband, and we got married a few years later. I came to Britain because I was curious to learn about the country and experience its diversity and toleration, something that I didnt experience as a child in the United States. I really enjoyed my years as a student, and I would like others to have the same opportunity that I had. I decided to stay in the UK because this country offered me freedom of expression and mobility, as well as many opportunities to stimulate my thoughts and learn new ways of understanding the world. As a professional I have had opportunity to engage with the British local government community and understand the devolution process that Britain has undergone since 2000. In particular, I have been interested in studying how local government in the UK changes as it incorporates new processes of citizen participation in its decision-making. British media and academic curricula generally portray the levels of violence in Mexico and Central America, and the topic of Latin Americas role in the process of globalization and democracy is generally overlooked. This is why I teach my students about it; I think that discussing the history and culture of Mexico and other countries in Latin America provides students with a more well-rounded understanding of the world, and how our society can learn about human rights and social movements against poverty, inequality, and exclusion from the Southern part of the globe."
972	Vanessa	Portugal	Belgium	E	E	close	22413	45028	E	im	female	Moving in and out of different countries has been part of my history in so many ways because I have parents with multi-cultural backgrounds and have had the opportunity to explore different cultural identities. It has really shaped how I see the world. When you think about Angola, Portugal, and Brazil, they are countries that all speak Portuguese, so you might assume that there is not much of a cultural change between them. However, there are different rules in each culture that challenge how we see things. Sometimes people think that if you were born in one place you have to fit into a certain identity. It is difficult when people ask me, Where are you from? and I say Portugal. And then they ask, Where are you really from? You do not need to belong or be attached to one place in order to have identity. Our identities are a mix of many things, apart from where we were born or where we grew up. Its hard for me to say that my identity is Portuguese or Angolan or Brazilian, because of course I feel strongly connected to them all. Moving to the UK for university was actually one of the biggest changes for me because, culturally speaking, because it is very different from any of the countries I had lived in before. My father took me there and I remembered I cried and said I didnt want to go. Every time I move, I cry. Im not always sure if I will adapt, or if I will even lose a little bit of my identity. Despite this, I feel like every time I have moved I have been able to write a new story - by meeting new people, by challenging my way of living. You really end up finding home in so many places, because it is a feeling and not a place. Right now I am about to leave Brussels, and in many ways I am sad because I have made friends who made me feel at home. That being said, its important when you go to a new city for one day, a month, or even move there, that you step out of your way of doing things. Sometimes we assume that other cultures exist in a completely different galaxy than ours, which I dont think is true. There is always something you can do. Have a meal with someone new and, for a second, put yourself in that persons shoes. Its a mistake to consider yourself open-minded just by being in a different region without trying on a new perspective.
973	Vani	Fiji	Kuwait	O	M	far	5013	24809	E	im	female	I was born and raised in the rural parts of the beautiful island of Fiji, where we mostly depended on root crops and fishing as our main sources of income.  Fiji is a multi-racial and multi-cultural society with the most developed economy in the Pacific thanks to an abundance of forest and mineral resources.  But I wanted to move to an urban area to continue my studies and to try to get a job. Due to the high cost of living, I decided to come to Kuwait with the help of my younger brother who was already living here. I joined a security company in 2014 as a female guard based with a UN agency. And Im still working here now! The last two years have been both very challenging and really interesting to me. Meeting new people, adapting to a new lifestyle and different climate as well as visiting new places have been great experiences, but they have also been difficult. Ive tried to understand the diverse customs and traditions. What I love here is how they show their affection in unique daily greetings with a handshake and a kiss on both cheeks. Still holding tight to their religion, men and women regularly get together in social settings, which I find fascinating. But I have to admit that biggest challenge for me was coming from a country of green forests and tropical climate to the desert life! All in all, I have been happy here in Kuwait, especially knowing that I am able to support my family back home.

Even though he is working long hours in a very hard environment, Vara makes it a point to spend one and a half hour exercising every day. He is also watching his food and is on a diet. In India, Vara was. quite chubby, he says, amused. Behind this hard work, Vara has one goal: to contribute financially to his family at home, and support his wife and two children. He talks endearingly about his household back in Tamil Nadu where they have a small plantation behind his house. They planted mango tree, guava tree, tomatoes and some flowers. But none of these are for sale; it was a hobby that he and his wife shared. Varas life in Singapore is good. The people there are so good to him that it provides a good environment that makes him happy. And when he is happy, Vara thinks of his family and is able to carry out his job well."
975	Victor	France	France	E	E	close	38959	38959	E	hc	male	This year, for the first time, the Refugee Cultural Festival was organised in Geneva, Switzerland. I was happy to take part in the planning and execution of the first edition. For a long time, I have thought that locals could do more to help refugees and migrants by learning to be curious about others and creating social spaces where everyone can express themselves freely. This is what our festival tried to promote and encourage. I'm currently back in my home country, but travel has taken me to many places around the world, including Canada where I used to live. I therefore understand the ways in which migration and, in some cases, asylum can change one's life outlook. Ultimately, everyone wants to fit in regardless of their background or the circumstances that caused them to relocate — that's what integration is about. Those who move should do their best to stay curious and openminded, but those in the receiving country should spend less time looking at the differences and more time trying to find the similarities between all of us. We are all cut from the same cloth, for we are all humans no matter our differences.
976	Víctor Hugo Abanto Guadiamos	Peru	Spain	L	E	far	6163	27409	E	im	male	My name is Víctor Abanto and I was born in the city of Trujillo, in the department of La Libertad, Peru. I studied Biological Sciences in the specialty of Fisheries Biology and graduated in 2014 from the National University of Trujillo. A year later, I specialized in Integral Management Systems and development in ISO Standards. Thanks to the motivation from my teachers and family, I developed my thesis on a project evaluating Andean lagoons in our country. Years later, I was able to work in important entities and programs, always aiming at the improvement and progress of my country. I migrated because I fell in love. When I traveled to Spain, I met my wife, Yennyfer. Today, we live in the city of Madrid, Spain, and we have a beautiful daughter. I was able to homologate my degree in Marine Biology and was able to finish a masters in public administration. I work in an International Consulting and Engineering company and, recently, I was admitted to the Master of Sanitary Biology or Biotechnology at the Complutense University of Madrid. What I miss the most about Peru is its Gastronomy, its music, the human warmth of our people, my family and my friends. In the future, I hope to be able to share with my country all the experience that I gained, since I know that we are in a period in which our beloved Peru needs better professionals. The love I feel for my country makes me want to be able to contribute for a better social and economic development.
977	Victoria	Spain	United Kingdom	E	E	close	27409	40718	E	im	female	I came to the UK from Madrid 14 years ago, I'd been a Creative Director of a top ad agency in Madrid and London is the where the world's best advertising is done. When I arrived my English was not good. I visited a headhunter and explained I wanted to get a job in a good London Ad Agency. She was impressed with my portfolio but suggested I took a plane straight back to Madrid, no one hires foreigners in the London ad scene, plus your English isn't great, plus you're a woman, so there's little to no chance anyone will hire you. Maybe because I'm a Latin, we don't give up easily. I persisted. Within a few years I was working in an boutique creative ad agency set up by a former director and Creative Director from Saatchi & Saatchi, Chris Arnold. After a merger I became Creative Director of BLAC Advertising. 6 years ago Chris and I formed our own ad agency, Creative Orchestra. We've worked for lots of well known clients - Diageo, IKEA, Sainsbury's, King of Shaves, AOL, NUS, Total, and many more. But we also cultivate young creatives and take people from all over the world (and a good few Spanish) - last count we've had 22 different nationalities pass through here, probably more than any other ad agency in London. Aside to the agency we started up a not-for-profit organisation Quality of Spain that cultivates links between Spain and the UK.
978	Vladimir Petkovic	Bosnia and Herzegovina	Switzerland	E	E	close	6035	86919	H	im	male	In 1976, an energetic and exuberant 41-year-old Bosnian Croat named Miroslav Blažević was appointed as manager of the Switzerland national team. Back then, the ethnic composition of the central Europeans was largely homogenous with the coming decades bringing about waves of immigration and significantly altering the demographics of the nation known for its cheese, mountains and watches. Having failed to qualify for the 1978 World Cup, Blažević departed his post and returned to his native Yugoslavia where he later led a newly-independent Croatia to third place at the 1998 World Cup in France. Almost 42 years have passed since Blaževićs appointment, and the man now commanding the touchline for the Swiss is another Bosnian Croat in 54-year-old Vladimir Petković. The social worker turned football manager left his hometown, Sarajevo, three decades ago and his life since then evoked the Dino Merlin hit, Moj Je Život Švicarska (My Life is Switzerland). Born in Sarajevo in 1963, his parents jobs as teachers meant Petkovićs early years were spent living on the outskirts of the historical city, firstly in picturesque Vrelo Bosne and then the neighbourhood of Hadžici. A technical-gifted, towering midfielder, he progressed his way through the youth academy of FK Sarajevo – one of the citys two big football institutions alongside Željezničar. Having broken into the first-team aged 18, he completed his year of mandatory military service before returning to the club following the sale of their supremely-talented attacking midfielder Safet Sušić to Paris Saint-Germain. With first-team opportunities limited, Petković spent a short time in the second tier with Rudar Prijedor, where his reputation as a goalscoring midfielder was enhanced. Upon his return to the capital, he played a peripheral role for the Bordo-bijeli, who claimed their second championship crown under the tutelage of Boško Antić. Although traditionally perceived to be the club of Sarajevos Bosniak aristocratic class, their supporter base was largely made up of inhabitants from the citys central neighbourhoods and, at the time, was largely multi-ethnic.
979	Waseem	Syrian Arab Republic	Turkey	M	M	close	890	8538	H	im	male	Waseem is a 13 year old boy from Aleppo. An adult living in the body of a young boy, the experiences in Syria have forced him to mature years beyond his actual age. Originally from a small town in Aleppo where he lived with his parents and six siblings, he remembers the early days of the war, when it came to his home. I was sleeping at the time when a loud explosion woke me up. I went outside to see what was happening and when I opened the door I saw a dead child on the street and a plane circling in the air. All of a sudden it dropped a bomb near our house killing my neighbour, he recounts. It wasnt long before my school was bombed. After that, none of us could go to school anymore so we stayed out on the streets because we had nothing to do and we were also scared of being bombed next. With no school, Waseem decided to work as a child labourer for nearly a year selling snacks like popcorn to provide for his family. We stayed in our home for some time. As the war raged on, it became harder to find things like food and petrol. People started to use benzene to fuel their cars because it was all that was available. One day a plane dropped a bomb that hit our building and blew up the store on the first floor which had containers full of benzene which all caught on fire. My dad was on the balcony when the building collapsed and he fell and was burned to death. I was taken to the hospital to treat the open gash on my hand but the hospital had almost no supplies. They had to stich my hand with no anaesthetics. Despite these horrors he has endured, he remains calm and unnerved in his demeanour. I saw a lot of children become orphans during that time. I just got used to seeing my family and friends die. After coming to Turkey with his family in 2013, he worked for nearly three years in a local bakery to help make ends meet. At first I started cleaning the floors and helping to keep the place clean but slowly they started teaching me how to bake bread and by the end I was working as a professional baker. Sometimes I would even bake at home for my mom, brothers and sisters. They loved my pizzas and breads! Waseem is now enrolled at the community centre run by Syrian Social Gathering (SSG) which provides him free education and a chance to finish his studies alongside thousands of other refugee children who have had their studies interrupted by the ongoing war. Even though he now is beginning to have a life resembling normalcy, he does not feel at home in Turkey. I might be here in Turkey but my heart still lies in Syria where I left it behind. I just cant forget and move on from what is happening there. I know it in my heart that I have to return at some point. I want to become a doctor or architect to help rebuild my country.

My family still lives in Damascus, but sadly I have not been able to see them since 2011. It is hard to be away from my country and not being able to go back; Syria is my homeland. Its where I was born and raised and I wish to be buried. In 2009 I moved to Cairo, Egypt and lived there until 2014. Since then, I live in the United Kingdom. I'm glad I successfully studied and worked in the field I am most passionate about, at the time when my country and my people are in need of people like me to articulate their issues and raise awareness about their cause. I have been invited to speak on different occasions this year about the refugee crisis, as Syrian refugees were the main subject of my thesis. The Syrian community in the UK helped me a lot to complete my research, giving me access to refugees, community leaders and Syrian professionals in international humanitarian organizations. Due to the effects of the Syrian conflict on human mobility, half of the population has been displaced, and those who were successfully in fleeing the war atrocities that included war crimes and crimes against humanity, are now in need to have their voices heard and rights respected. Despite the difficulties faced by Syrians everywhere, they are able to prove their abilities and contribute to the development of host societies. As part of the Syrian community in UK, I can say that we are all sharing the burden and the responsibility towards our country."

My formative were spent during Chinas 10-year long Cultural Revolution when my parents were sent to two labor camps several hundred kilometers away from me and from each other. I was one of the millions of Chinese set-down youth for three years, working as a peasant in a remote mountain rural area, where the room temperature inside our place was -10 Celsius! Afterward, I started college then entered one of Chinas top universities, Peking University (PKU) for my Masters degree, and was retained as a faculty member there for three years. Trained by a University of Maryland PhD degree holder, I got familiar with the American way of research and teaching. Despite having no formal spoken English training, I was assigned by my department to accompany foreign visiting professors and their families to interpret and/or take them sightseeing. On March 1, 1988, I crossed the Pacific for the first time (and it was the second ever time I was inside an airplane!) when I became a junior visiting scholar in Lincoln, Nebraska (NE), leaving behind my ailing father and newly-wed husband. I had not planned at all to become an immigrant, let alone a naturalized citizen of another country. The plan then was to finish my visiting period, go back to PKU to teach, reunite with my folks and start a family in order to live happily ever after in Beijing. From day 1, I knew I was a relatively privileged migrant, despite landing in the United States with only US$40 in my pocket and not knowing anyone in NE (at least I thought so). As a visiting scholar, I was guaranteed a $6,500 stipend for a year so I never had to worry about where my next meal or rent came from. However, it did not mean life as an international migrant was easy, above and beyond leaving family behind. Instead I faced many challenges, some I took on on my own to go out of my comfort zone and to explore the United States as a geographer, others involved heartbreaking betrayals by colleague or those close to me. Within a month of my arrival, against everyones advice I gave a guest lecture to a big undergraduate class, then rode with a few graduate students to the Grand Canyon and Phoenix for my first ever Association of American Geographers annual meeting – since then I have been to 27 of them and the national organization has renamed as American Association of Geographers – a sign of internationalization. I decided to stay and get my PhD degree, then work as a professor in the United States instead of in China. Through trials and tribulations, including a few regrets at some critical life junctures, I became who I am today, and I have no regret at all for the path I have plowed and the journey I have taken: I have been a professor of Asian Pacific American Studies and Geography at two US universities in the past 20 years, achieving my life goal of serving as a bridge across the Pacific – by teaching Americans about what outside the United States and teaching international students about the United States, mentoring the next generation of human bridges; researching and publishing about international migration, the triumph and human sacrifice; and serving my colleagues, university, profession, my home and adopted home countries and beyond. As a woman, racial minority, and a non-native English speaking immigrant, I have so far served as a cultural ambassador for my adopted country as a senior Fulbright scholar to two other countries in recent 10 years: Canada and India respectively. That speaks to the truth that diversity is the strength of a country, not a weakness. For me, home is where people I love and who love me live, and where I feel am just another human being, not someone to be stared at or discriminated against. I am only one out of the 257.7 million international migrants who live and work outside our country of origin. Our collective experiences demonstrate, when facing determined human beings, physical barriers cannot stop them, evident in the historical Chinese 5,500mi/8,850km-long Great Wall could not have prevented northern invaders to rule China for a few dynasties, or in recent history that the fortified Berlin Wall did not prevent people seeking freedom. More barriers to human success exist within our minds – the fear of difference or losing dominance in ones own neighborhood or country. Only open-mindedness can overcome such barriers to realize human beings are so much more alike in our emotions and experiences than our differences in appearance, skin color, eye shape, language, culture, ideological or religious beliefs, and truth and knowledge will be the best tool in such a process. The right mindset and actions would realize how international migrants are assets not liabilities whereas diversity is to be celebrated not just tolerated. After all, like everything else, people are born then die, countries rise or fall, and we only have this common earth that we all share among ourselves and with future generations."
982	Wendy	United States	United Kingdom	N	E	far	63123	40718	E	im	female	I first came to the UK 20 years ago as a PhD student to do research with the man who is now my husband. Nine years ago we got married in a castle in Northumberland – quite a thrill for this American woman. I love my new country. I am a Lecturer in Oral Biology at Newcastle University, teaching tooth anatomy and histology to dental students and an Honorary Research Fellow at Durham University, doing research in dental anthropology. Science is a global endeavor and the UK would suffer tremendously if immigrants didnt come here to do research and teach in our universities. I became a British citizen in 2010, primarily so that I could vote. As we say in my country of origin, No taxation without representation. I am proud to be British but in 2014, I learned that I am not equal to other British citizens when my son tried to visit me, was locked up in a cell at Heathrow overnight and returned to the USA the next day. Despite speaking to us several times on the phone, the UK Border Force told us that he had been denied entry because he had no reason to return to the USA. My son had lost his job and we had hoped his visit would give him a period of time to think about what he wanted to do for the rest of his life, not sneak him into a country permanently in which he could not work nor have medical care. Around the same time, a former student of mine had come over to do a postgraduate degree, had fallen in love, gotten married and had to return to the USA because her husband, although employed, did not make enough money for her to remain. Her potential to earn a living here was not taken into account. This policy discriminates against British citizens born and raised in this country by preventing them from living with their own spouses. The policies enacted in this country that prevent families from being together are inhumane and I hope that my participation in the I am an immigrant poster campaign will help people to recognise that immigrants make positive contributions to British society and that we are unique human beings, not a collective to be vilified. Lets celebrate immigration because it is good for all of us!

984	Xavier	El Salvador	United States	L	N	far	3799	63123	H	im	male	For me, the American dream is not to have a house or a lot of money. For me, the dream is to do what I like, work on what I like and live from it. Two and a half years ago, I came to America in search of an opportunity for professional development in the scientific field. That was the first time that Ive travelled by airplane and the ride was like doing a Masters in Improvisation. To think on what you left behind, but above all, to think about the unknown that I would have to face, and to begin a process of adaptation to many new things. For my country, I brought two coffee makers, my personal computer and some clothes. Now, looking back, I can say that, by my thirties, all my life fit in three suitcases. Thats when I started as an intern in a study program that allowed me to continue my training in California. I participated as a volunteer in a research program at UCLA, and then I moved to New York to work with the Salvadoran Renal Foundation. And now, Im starting a new phase in Boston, working as a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. I feel privileged to work in what I like, as a researcher of the medicine branch that I like. I am sure that this alignment of events does not happen very often. I miss my family and pupusas, although here there are a lot of Salvadorans and, of course there are pupusas, they dont taste the same. I also miss coffee. Every time a friend comes from El Salvador, I ask them to bring me some. There are some very good coffees, but the Salvadoran coffee is always better. Someday I hope to help the people in El Salvador, to continue to do research to help improve health conditions in the country and to manage cooperation agreements that benefit the Salvadoran communities.
985	Xavier	France	France	E	E	close	38959	38959	E	hc	male	"Migrating has had a significant impact on my life and made me the person I am. My journey began at the age of two, when I went through my first involuntary migration from Casablanca in Morocco – where I was born – to Douala and then Yaoundé in Cameroon. From there, my family and I flew to Paris in France. This was my second involuntary migration. As a young adult, after moving across France, of my own will, from one city to another, I chose to move to Geneva in Switzerland to work for an NGO Aide et Action Internationale whose mission is to change the world through education. If you ask me what I have learnt from these experiences, here is my answer: resilience and adaptability. From a very young age, I have understood that migrating also implied leaving behind loved ones, adventures, smells and sensations that still live in me. I remember being carried on my Cameroonian nannys back; I remember the touch of her skin, her smell and her voice when she was singing. All this made me a member of the African community. I remember picking a banana and eating it with its skin; running barefooted on the red earth, driving on uneven surfaces to go to Kribi beach… I had to let that life go. Through those migrations, I discovered that movement is life and that each individual has to adapt to their environment; which I did, fearlessly and out of interest and curiosity. Human mobility is precious for it fosters diversity, curiosity and open-mindedness. Change is our greatest wealth and it does not cost a dime. I had the chance to travel from country to country, town to town, and to change companies and careers in a carefree and confident way. Neither my place of birth, nor my background or studies prepared me for the life I had. Only my capacity to adapt and accept change took me where I am now. And its not over yet. I am going to turn 60 and I am leaving Geneva to go work for Handicap International in Lyon, France. I live each day with a quenchless curiosity and desire to learn."
986	Xavier Michael	Micronesia	United States	I	N	far	3500	63123	H	im	male	As he sits under a gazebo chewing betel nut, Xavier Michael, who grew up on the remote island of Falalop in Yap State, (part of the Federated States of Micronesia FSM) quite literally wears his migrant past. His bottom half is draped in a native thu, contrasting with the American sports tank top that covers his chest. At the age of 30, Michael left his home in the FSM for the first time after being accepted into the Job Corps program in Sacramento, California.  The first thing I noticed was lots of lights. Very nice, he said, gesturing a landing plane with his hand.  Michael had left FSM in search of adventure and a chance at new skills that would help him support his family. He left with an open-mind, despite being warned of the potential perils that he would face abroad. I heard that this school was just for high school dropouts,  tough people. But when I got there, none of that was correct, Michael reminisced. Besides a cousin that lived in San Jose, Michael knew no one in the place he would call home for the next year and seven months. I heard if you make friends, youre free. If you dont make friends, youre gonna get homesick. He wasted no time setting out to make friends. A soft-spoken man with a gentle demeanor, Michael stepped far out of his comfort zone, making an effort to introduce himself to everyone he met. I have a lot of friends now. Mexican friends, Chinese friends, Vietnamese friends, black American friends, white American friends, and actually now we even still write each other, he explained. During his year-long stint at the Job Corps, Michael studied painting and maintenance. When hed finished the program, he found employment as a handyman for a Korean landlord in Sacramento. He felt that he was treated well and appreciated the good wages and working conditions of the US. After seven months of working and saving his money, Michael returned to Falalop to take care of his parents. His new friends presented him souvenirs before his departure, many of which hes kept to this day. However, its a single memory that forged the most profound impact on Michael during his time abroad. Michaels voice swelled with pride as he spoke of it. The most memorable thing was the Golden Gate Bridge. When I saw it, I was happy, so, so happy because I knew when I came back here my family and friends would see it in a lot of shows on TV and I could say Ive been there,  he smiled.
987	Xiangwei	China	Estonia	I	E	far	10229	23106	E	im	male	"I am from China, from one big Chinese city with the population of eight million. While I was in China I didnt know anything about Estonia, I had heard very little about it. All three Baltic States were mixed up in my mind; I knew that they are located near Russian Federation and are former Soviet Union countries. I was a very active person as a student in China and I didnt like when there were too much control over the society. I participated in Beijing demonstration, but unfortunately freedom never came to China and also the Soviet Union collapsed. At university western philosophy was very popular. I came to Estonia in 1994, I was working as a Translator (I was studying Russian language at university) in a Chinese company. I came to Estonia because here theres economic freedom and many possibilities for personal development. Estonia is a very good country. Estonian people are peaceful. During the 22 years that Ive lived here I never had any serious conflict. Local people talk to me in English, however language plays very important role. It wasnt possible to understand what is going on in the society and in politics if you dont understand Estonian language. I was searching for different possibilities of learning, I took the language course but it wasnt enough. I think that reading is the best way to learn a language. I visited libraries and borrowed big English-Estonian dictionaries. After a while I started to understand the grammar too, how to build the sentences, that knowledge helped me a lot. Then I started watching TV. When you dont know the language, TV is not just entertainment, it is the way of learning. I also took a bookkeeping course in Estonian language and I had to pass an exam, that wasnt possible to pass without understanding of Estonian language. Then I met one person who has a Gymnasium for adults and I decided to join. The Director of the Gymnasium couldnt believe that a person with higher education is willing to go back to school. So I studied one year and finished 12th grade in Estonian. I was looking for free language learning possibility and I found it. My wife is Estonian, we met at Concordia University, where we were both students. I always tell our children that they are Estonians, they live here. They talk to their mother in Estonian. They know Chinese only a little, as they dont use it and there is no motivation to learn it. As I work a lot, there is no time for me to talk to them in Chinese nor to teach them. However, we went to China together, they were exploring the culture and visiting relatives, so the connection with China still exists."
988	Xyza	Philippines	China	I	I	close	3299	10229	E	im	female	Born in Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines, Xyza came to Hong Kong SAR China about ten years ago, to join her mother who worked as a domestic worker for a wealthy family. She became a helper too, looking after the familys grandchildren. By the age of 19, she already had set her dream to be a professional photographer and when she was able to afford her first camera, she started shooting black-and-white scenes around Hong Kong during her spare time, which was usually one day per week. Xyzas strong affinity to her community means that she has been particularly keen to document through her photos, the lives of her compatriots and other migrant workers. I want to use my lens to tell people about the lives of migrant domestic workers. Domestic work is a job and our human rights should be respected as others are, she says. The impressive result which showcased her series of poignant and at time harrowing black-and-white images of women living in a shelter for abused migrant workers was covered by CNN. Besides coverage by CNN, Xyzas story has also been covered by the NY Times Lens Blog. Xyza has transformed her life by pursuing her interest in photography and most importantly, she has used her photographic skills to focus on the plight of migrant domestic workers like herself and her mother. In fact, the aforementioned photo series on migrant domestic workers helped land her the prestigious 2015 Human Rights Fellowship from the Magnum Foundation, which offered her a six-week intensive programme in photography at New York University, New York City. As one of only seven 2015 recipients from around the world, Xyza explored strategies for creating effective visual stories with the aim of advancing human rights in her home country. To pursue this exciting next chapter in her life, Xyza was released from her employment contract by her employer and having successfully completed her fellowship, she has now embarked on a career as a freelance photographer and is currently working on a project in New York. Xyza wants her pictures to bring awareness to migrant domestic workers and after all, she says: Awareness brings changes. Every migrant worker, who is separated from their family, working abroad for the prosperity of their loved ones, is a migrant hero, she says. Now 27, Xyza divides her time between New York and Hong Kong, while her father and two siblings remain in the Philippines and her mother still lives in Hong Kong working for the same employer she has worked for, for more than 20 years. Much of Xyzas work can be found on her website: www.xyzacruzbacani.com
989	Yaman	Syrian Arab Republic	United Kingdom	M	E	far	890	40718	H	im	male	I left Syria and moved to Istanbul, Turkey when I was 22, just after completing my bachelors degree at Aleppo University. The reason I left Syria is the compulsory military service that would drag me into a war that I refuse to take part in. Istanbul gave me the feeling of belonging instantly since it felt like a modern version of Aleppo. The cultural values were similar however more cosmopolitan that what I have experienced. The language barrier didnt seem to be an obstacle as I thought it would be because of the many shared words and expressions between Arabic and Turkish. Also, most of the people I met there made an effort to speak English and help me comprehend Turkish. Then after three years of studying and working in Turkey, I moved to Durham, UK to pursue a masters in Finance as a Chevening Scholar. Durham first struck me as one of the calmest and most beautiful places I had ever been to. When you start meeting new students, the first question asked is where are you from?, most of my colleagues (now friends) thought I am either Greek, Italian, or Spanish, which I find very interesting and later on funny immediately after I tell them that I am Syrian and the expression of I dont know what to say appears on their faces then they say thats cool, sorry I shouldnt say cool. The people I met in Durham were very friendly and kind to me, their curiosity about the situation in Syria lead us to many interesting discussions and debates. I enjoy helping others in their studies and general life challenges. I have always been involved in student and community leadership roles, and I believe that education and hard work is what I need to bring back to Syria in the foreseeable future. My mission in life is to achieve my potential to the fullest. Right now that means using my skills and knowledge to establish an international career in Finance. Later on, I want to employ my drive and experience to improve the economy of my country and serve its people in the best way possible. Every now and then, I think about Syria, and that I miss my parents so much and wonder what it wouldve been like if I were with them during this critical time. My original home will always be Syria, but I am proud to say that I have multiple homes right now (Syria, Turkey, and the UK) since home to me is where my loved ones are. Whilst in the UK, I will do my best to contribute to the local community I am living in, assist charities and volunteer in my free time. As well as, providing my skills, knowledge, and expertise to the organisation I would work for, in order to be an active member in such a vibrant economy. I wish Syria peace, humility, forgiveness, and solidarity from the people of other countries. Only unity and understanding would bring an end to such a conflict, something all Syrians aspire to.
990	Yammans family	Syrian Arab Republic	Greece	M	E	far	890	18117	H	im	n	Yamman and Fatma are a young couple from Syria. Together with their children, Abdalrahman and Omar, they are among the first group of refugees to relocate to Sweden. Im so happy to relocate to Sweden, I really wanted to go there. It is a good country, a safe place for our children and for us. Also, my brother is there for a number of years, so I will meet him again. Before the war, I was studying computer technology at the university in Syria. I wanted to continue with my studies, to do something more but the war broke and I had to stop. It was very difficult. Men were forcibly recruited to the governments army and if I stayed, Id have to kill people, but I dont want to hurt anybody. I left Syria 5 years ago, alone. At first, I stayed in Turkey for 4 months and then I went to Egypt. I spent there about ten months and then I moved back to Turkey, were I stayed for 2.5 years. At that time, my then fiancé, Fatma joined me there. Our first child was born in Turkey and by the time Fatma was pregnant on our second, we left for Greece. Like so many others, we crossed the sea on a rubber boat and it was a terrifying adventure. About 30 minutes into the journey, the boat stopped, it was about 4 am in the night. We drifted for hours. We called the emergency number and the Greek coast-guard came with a boat and took only the women and children. They told us that theyd take our families to Greece and that theyd come back for us, the men. So they left, but it was the Turkish coast-guard that arrived instead, 30 minutes later. Maybe we had drifted towards Turkey, I dont know. They told us that they had to take us back to Turkey. I got very angry. I speak Turkish, I explained to them that our families were already taken to Greece. But they insisted and they took us back and since they were really angry, we didnt resist. In Turkey, they checked our papers and they let us go. However, I had all of the familys passports and our only mobile phone. Fatma, terrified, ended up all alone with our child on a tiny Greek island. Fortunately, I was able to take another boat the next day and joined my family on the island of Kastelorizo. It was the 19th of February 2017. Then, the coast-guard moved us to the island of Rhodes where we got registered. Another boat journey took us to Athens. We decided to continue to the border, which was still open. It took us five days to get to the makeshift camp of Idomeni. We crossed Greece sleeping rough, one night at a basketball court, another night at a restaurant. We spent three weeks at Idomeni, waiting to cross, to no avail. We were given the number 136 and the last number allowed to cross was 65. So, we came back to Athens and went directly to the Asylum service and applied for the relocation programme. We were given an apartment in the centre and waited for the news. In the meantime, our time here was well-spent. Greece is the most beautiful country Ive ever seen. We visited the Acropolis, a lot of other sites, we took the kids to the beach. We have almost become locals. And the people here are simple and very supportive to the refugees, we never had any problems. Three weeks ago we got the news that were going to Sweden. Well have to learn the language, but I dont mind since I love learning languages and meeting new people. I would like to continue with my studies and look for a job. I dont want to sit around doing nothing. I need to update my training on computer technology, its been 5 years that I graduated and I really have to learn again, to follow the new developments. And Fatima, too, wishes to continue with her studies as well, she actually wants to be a nurse. I hope we will be able as parents to provide a safe, beautiful life to our children in our new home in Sweden.
991	Yan	México	United Kingdom	L	E	far	8326	40718	E	im	male	I was born and raised in a multicultural home. Born to immigrant parents in Mexico: A French/British father and a Argentinian mother. Whose parents where both immigrants themselves. I have some sort of relatives Far and wide from Poland to Australia. So I was raised in Mexico and even though I feel mostly Mexican, I can't deny the my mixed heritage is but a part of me. It's what has made me tolerant to different people and cultures. What has showed me there are different ways to live your life and there isn't a normal way of doing things. They all are! Having the opportunity / responsibility to help my grandfather in the UK, me and my wife moved to get work experience abroad and extend our horizons. After 3 years living and working in London, we both feel as being part of this melting pot, which is something I value greatly. Being able to learn about traditions from India, Uzbekistan, Thailand, Germany, Italy Greece. Is what I most value about living here. Since I moved here I've learnt to become a better citizen. Belonging to a place where the majority of people don't tolerate racism or gender inequality is what I feel this country should be about and hope it stays that way. I wish to keep contributing and giving back to a country that has welcomed me!
992	Yescarleth Rodriguez	Nicaragua	Costa Rica	L	L	close	1905	12077	H	im	female	Over 26 years ago I migrated to Costa Rica when I was just a baby. My migration experience may be different to that of some people because when you are a baby you dont get to choose, someone chooses for you. In my case, it was my mom. To this day, I do not know all my family. I dont see them much, I cannot distinguish who is my uncle or my aunt. I could run into them in the street and do not know who they are. Lately, some close persons have passed away, and even death, without a body to bury or space where to accompany it, implies feelings that cannot be express by words. As a foreigner, the joys and sorrows are experienced differently. The hardest part is always to rediscover yourself because since you dont have a close or clear origin, and you face discrimination and phrases like you dont belong here even if you came when you were little, you might be tempted to feel like you are from nowhere, like you are not a part of anything. You might be tempted to think you do not have the right to sing a national anthem, to celebrate a national holiday, to speak like a tica or to have an opinion about what is going on in the country. Since I was little and thanks to reading, an activity I love since I was eight years old, I started to realize that I was simply a person that was not from anywhere, but I was actually from the whole world. I discovered that to migrate means to move and that every person, physically or spiritually, is a migrant. At 12, a high school public speaking contest in which I discussed reading, migration and refugees set the first stone that allows me to work today counseling and facilitating integration processes for people who, just like my family, search a better world. This deep desire to build a homeland, humanity and a dignified living for everyone is not an easy job but is a strong belief. Costa Rica is a wonderful country, is the land that has seen me grow up. However, I believe that more than a nation in this land, the call of all people is to build a universal humanity wherever we may be.

I travelled to Malawi through Kenya and Tanzania, but I spent eight months in a prison in Malawi because I had entered the country illegally. I came back to Ethiopia in December 2017, with the help of the IOM. IOM staff came to the prison to help us, they facilitated our transport and everything — we came back in an airplane. Then IOM and the EU gave us clothes and training at the Transit Centre, and transportation to our hometowns. I chose to start a cattle farming business because I have experience in that. I have five bulls now that IOM and the EU bought for me. They also bought me a two-week supply of compound feed for my animals, now I feed them on grass. And Im going to sell them in September for the Meskel celebration (an Ethiopian national festival). I will sell one bull for 12000 birr (approx. USD 450) then buy more cattle and keep growing the business. After that, I will expand my business to engage in grain trading.
994	Yosief	Eritrea	Switzerland	A	E	far	588	86919	H	im	male	The escape from Eritrea was quite long and exhausting. Walking for days, being held captive in several countries and crossing of one of the world's biggest deserts didn't make it an easy journey. We were lucky though. Everyone survived. I took some personal things with me but I had to throw most of it away before crossing the desert so I could take as many bottles of water with me as possible. I kept a small book with phone numbers and a few photos from my childhood. The phone numbers were very important, because I was held captive a few times and had to pay my captors a ransom for them to let me go. I'm lucky enough to have an uncle in the United States – he'd send me money so I could pay. That made his number the most important thing in my life.

996	Youssef	Morocco	Belgium	A	E	far	3108	45028	H	im	male	My parents and grand-parents have travelled through Morocco, Europe and Belgium, just to be able to establish a new life. This gave me the chance to develop myself in a much better way than I could have ever done in Morocco. Leaving your home country is a struggle for most people: It leaves an important part of you behind while finding a new identity and a new place for yourself in another country. It is a very dual thing, it is both intriguing and beautiful. Developing yourself in two different cultures or two different countries it is an absolute added value. You understand so much more of the world, it makes you so much stronger. To me, home is where the heart is. I believe I still have a certain emotional tie with Morocco however my past, present and future is in Belgium. I love getting a grasp of how people with different mindsets look at the world and knowing how people born and raised with different cultural and religious backgrounds experience things! There is an enormous pile of opportunities linked to migration: a diversity of backgrounds, languages, cultures. Migrants can be an absolute added value if we choose to see the opportunities they represent without denying the challenges. It can and will always be a beautiful thing if we invest in it.
997	Yui	Japan	Jordan	I	M	far	39990	4283	L	im	female	When Yui's friends encouraged her to join them on a trip to Syria in 2009, she was about to refuse. I had an idea in my head that the Middle East was not safe. But my friends insisted and I went. The food was delicious, the people were so friendly, and the architecture was so beautiful. I fell in love with the region right away. Back in Japan, I felt uncertain about my job, and had no desire to work in Japan forever. I always wanted to work outside of my country so I could explore the world and see things from a different perspective. I saw a position in Jordan at a major tourism company. I could help other Japanese become fond of the region as well! Now, Yuis job is to bring Japanese tourists to Jordan. She takes visitors to different tourist sites in Petra, the Dead Sea and Wadi Rum. I really love my job, because I feel Im doing something new. There arent so many Japanese people living in Jordan. Im the only one in my company, so my ideas are taken seriously when it comes to attracting tourists. Its my job to make sure that the places where Japanese tourists stay appeal to their sense of hospitality. In the meantime, she has built a new life in Amman. People here are so friendly.  When I am sick, my friends come visit me. My neighbors invite me for dinner at their place. I never feel really lonely in this country. Friendship means a lot here. Despite her warm welcome to Jordan, Yui still misses her homeland. Sometimes, when I see the strong bonds that people have with their family and friends here, it makes me miss my family. Sometimes when my mom hears that something happened in the region, she calls me to tell me not to go to any tourist sites. But hey, Mom! Thats my job!
998	Yukiko	Japan	Egypt	I	A	far	39990	3609	L	im	female	"I left my home country at the age of 22, after graduating the university in Tokyo. Why? Because I had a friend living in Cairo and I decided to go to a new country. My first impression in Egypt was that I felt like Alice in Wonderland, falling into another mysterious world. Of course I miss the food in Japan. Not only Japanese food, we can try to eat many kinds of food in Japan, which is rearranged with Japanese sense. Im missing all kinds of food that we can eat in Japan. When I walk down the streets in Cairo, I say to myself Watch my right, my left, my front, my behind, and my step, my head' I mean all the directions because theres a lot of crazy driving around me; there are also many holes & obstacles on the streets. I also tell myself to do everything at my own risk, and accept my destiny. While keeping my character as Japanese, I also follow the proverb when in Rome, do as the Romans do. Actually, when in Cairo, do as the Cairenes do. The most important is to be balanced. When Im lost and face the problem, I used to choose the middle road to keep being balanced. My mission is raising my daughters to be mentally healthy & physically healthy. I would like them to be 100% Egyptian and 100 Japanese, not like 50% Egyptian and 50 % Japanese. Home for me is where my mother exists. Nowadays, its so easy to stay in contact with my families & friends all over the word through social technology. While in this country I say keep being honest to others, dont hurt others chance, and dont envy others. I want the Japanese to notice we have a unique history, culture, and characters."
999	Yuliya	Ukraine	Ukraine	E	E	close	3557	3557	E	hc	female	It was a sunny day in Kharkiv, Ukraine when Anna (72) and Nikolay (75) journeyed from Mala Danylivka, the village where they live now, to collect money from a cash program offered by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). Anna and Nikolay are retired doctors. Before the conflict started in Ukraine, in April 2014, they lived in Stanitsa Luhansk. One night, they woke up to a strong blast as two bombs hit their house and the window of their daughters room collapsed on top of her.  Their daughter, Yuliya (43), was a biology teacher but could not work at school anymore as the building was also damaged by the bombings. After the incident, Yuliya, who had already some mobility problems, could not walk because of the trauma and the family decided to leave their life in Stanitsa Luhansk for a short while and seek safety in the Kharkiv region. Nikolay tried to stay longer in order to take care of their properties, but last August he left to join his wife and daughter as the situation wasnt getting better. They carried only one bag, as they thought they would stay for less than a month. Now the three of them still live in a small dormitory room and depend on humanitarian aid, support from government and the help of friends and family. As Yuliya cannot teach anymore, she has been developing other talents. She learned from teachers and the internet how to paint and sew. She now makes hand-sewn embroidery designs and sells them to friends. I cannot work as a teacher because of my mobility limitations, and I cannot find adequate transportation to be able to reach the nearest school from here. Before, it was sometimes boring to teach the same class over and over again, but now I miss it. Yuliya and her family have been through challenging situations in Stanitsa Luhansk. Because of the conflict there was no electricity or hot water anymore, so we started to make fires outside to be able to cook, but it was dangerous because of the shelling. One day our neighbours house was destroyed. She was an old lady and we tried to help her, but when we found her her body was burned. The family believes that now they will have to rebuild their lives elsewhere. We are like cut trees, our roots are left there in Stanitsa Luhansk and now we will have to make new roots grow here.
1000	Yusef	Syrian Arab Republic	Italy	M	E	far	890	31238	H	im	male	"I left Syria because of the war. I spent seven days at sea. When I first arrived, I crossed Europe; my goal was to reach England. I was in Calais for almost two months but I didnt manage to enter the UK, so I went to Sweden because winter had come in Calais and it seemed too cold to stay there. I stayed in Sweden. Then I came to Italy, where I currently work as a cultural mediator. Arriving in a new country is always more difficult than you could possibly imagine. You need to go back to school as if you are 6 years old again. You come here alone, without friends, without a family. You have nothing, you have to start from scratch. You can even feel bored as a migrant, because you cannot see your kids and you cannot even speak to them over the phone. You miss all of it: your family, friend and your habits, those little things that you never thought you could miss that much. Compared to France and Sweden, Italy feels closer to my culture. People are warm, they have this Mediterranean culture similar to ours. I feel less like a stranger, as if I was not in a foreign country somehow. I love Italy. I always did, since I was a kid. I love it because of the culture, which is very famous where Im from, for its history and for its football. But to feel fully at home I would need all the small things I had back home. When I arrived I thought I had had an awful journey, but by talking to others who crossed the Mediterranean too, I found out that my journey was five-star compared to that of others. Nevertheless, it was a really traumatic journey. No, starting from scratch is definitely not easy."
1001	Yusra Mardini	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	female	In 2015, Yusra Mardini almost drowned in the Mediterranean while fleeing the civil war in Syria. She survived thanks to her swimming skills – and, just a year later, competed at the Rio Olympics. Now Hollywood wants to tell her story. Almost every morning, a Syrian girl with a winning smile takes a deep breath and dives into the Olympic swimming pool on the outskirts of Berlin. As she rips through the water with a butterfly stroke honed from a lifetime of swimming, Yusra Mardini never forgets how close she came to drowning in the Mediterranean in 2015 as she fleed the civil war in Syria. When the motor on their dangerously overcrowded boat stalled off the coast of Turkey, Yusra and her older sister, Sarah, swam for more than three hours in the churning seas, pushing the boat towards the Greek islands. They helped save not just their own lives but those of 18 other refugees. I thought it would be a real shame if I drowned, Yusra said with typical nonchalance after her story became known, because I am a swimmer. A swimmer she is. As she dives again into the water, her babyish face hidden behind goggles, Yusra uses the memory of that traumatic journey and the bloody civil war from which she escaped to power her dreams. In the two and a half years since she arrived in Europe, Yusra – pronounced eesra – has competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics. She has met the Pope and Barack Obama. She has given speeches at the United Nations and to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Shes been appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). She has written a memoir, Butterfly, and a feature film about her, directed by Stephen Daldry, the Oscar-winning director of The Hours and Billy Elliot, is now in the works. Yes, we are refugees, but we are normal human beings, Yusra, 20, tells me she wants people to know. We think about our futures. We care about our kids. We are doctors and engineers and teachers. We are educated, but we just dont have the chance to continue our normal lives because of war. As lofty as her achievements have been since she fled Syria, Yusras focus is now back on swimming. She knows that she must get her times much lower to have a chance of competing in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. If I am going to be realistic, says Yusra, who at 55 is small for a swimmer, I know it will be really good if I am in the top 20 or 40 in the world. But Im not going to take that as an answer, so I am putting everything I can into this until the next Olympics.
1002	Yussuf	Syrian Arab Republic	Germany	M	E	far	890	45909	H	im	male	Im a Syrian engineer, and I studied Biotechnology in the University of Moscow. After graduation, I started working in a city hospital in Russia but was paid so little that I could hardly cover my rent. My salary was times lower compared to anybody else working in the sector because I was a foreigner. I invented a device for treating headaches, and I intend to work with medical institutions to test it further. Back in Syria it was out of the question to do this kind of work… actually, any kind of work was out of the question, so I came to Germany. I'm worried that I won't be able to find a job in Germany because I don't speak German nor English. The waiting time for enrolment in German classes is very long, it might take up to one year. At the moment I won't be able to do pretty much anything. The only thing I can do is wait in the camp and pray that my papers will be processed as fast as possible. It can be quite demoralizing to just sit around, I want to work and be useful for society. In the meantime, I'm trying to stay positive and hope for the best. I will try to learn German as fast as possible and find a way to continue working.
1003	Zabihullah	Afghanistan	Afghanistan	I	I	close	508	508	E	hc	male	Zabihullah is a father of five from Herat, a border town with Iran and a regional trade-hub. As a businessman trading carpets between Iran and Afghanistan, he was able to provide for a comfortable life for his family. However, this all changed when kidnappings of wealthy Afghans or their children increased. We really led a good life, and I owned land, a house and a car. But this all didnt matter anymore when I received increasing kidnapping threats on my family, particularly on my eldest son, explained Zabihullah. Due to the economic downturn and worsening security situation, criminal activities increased in Herat. I just grew increasingly worried for the safety of myself, my wife and my children. So I decided to leave Afghanistan to take them somewhere safe, he said. He had spoken to relatives who lived in Europe. Come to Germany, they said. Here your children will be safe, and they will go to University and become doctors and engineers like our children, Zabihullah recalled. Go to Germany, he was told by the smuggler he had contacted. As a family, they will easily grant you asylum. You just have to fly to Turkey, and then you go overland to Germany, it will not be too hard. And so he believed them. With the looming kidnapping threats on his family on one hand, and the desire to enable his children to study in good universities, he sold everything he owned to afford the USD 115.000 to pay a smuggler to take the family to Germany in 2015. But unfortunately, life in Germany was not as he imagined. First of all, my relatives had lied. Their children were not doctors or engineers, but assistant cooks and mechanics. Secondly, the smuggler had lied. It wasnt that easy to get asylum in Germany, and we were rejected the first time, Zabihullah recounted. When he learned that his 16-year old son and daughter were not going to be able to enter Universities but were enrolled in 2-year language classes to be followed by apprenticeships, their father didnt even want to try to appeal. I didnt realize that the entry requirements to universities in Germany were that high. But I also didnt do all of this for my children to become mechanics, he said. So he applied for IOMs voluntary return programme. With IOMs help, upon return to Afghanistan, Zabihullah bought a 20% stock in a mechanic shop where he still works. When we left Afghanistan, we sold everything and reduced our lives to zero here. And although our lives are nothing compared to what they were before, and I just make enough income to pay for food and rent, IOM at least gave us a small chance at a new start. If I had known what it was really going to be like abroad, and which difficulties I would face upon return, I would have never left.
1004	Zahid	Pakistan	Greece	I	E	far	1167	18117	H	im	male	When Zahid set out from his native Pakistan he was pursuing the dream a better life in Europe. After a long, dangerous journey, done mostly on foot and occasionally by car, Zahid arrived on the island of Lesbos, Greece. After spending 12 days there, he ended up on the island of Crete to work in husbandry. It was difficult, sometimes I had work, others not so much, he recounts, almost 2 years later. At 24, the young man found himself stuck in Greece, with no income and no options. That was the moment when he found out – through an acquaintance – about the AVRR, a core activity of IOM Greece. The staff here have been really helpful, really nice. Thanks to the reintegration programme, I will have the possibility to start a small grocery store, together with my brothers. Since 2010, IOM Greece, through the AVRR (AVRR) for short – has helped more than 30.000 individuals to return safely back home. Furthermore IOM Greece has supported over 3.200 migrants to successfully complete personalized reintegration plans in terms of sustainability for themselves and their families.
1005	Zaidan	Senegal	Mauritania	A	A	close	1458	1702	E	im	male	"There are 4.5 million Lebanese in Lebanon and around 12 million scattered around the world. Movement is in our blood. We take our skills and expertise and export them to other countries offering better opportunities to develop our capacities. For this reason we consider migration as a win-win situation for all, as something natural. My father was the first to leave Lebanon in the 1960s/1970s. He migrated to Senegal, where I was born. I lived there until the age of 18. Then, I left for Niamey, Niger, where I remained for 20 years. My brother was there.  Our tradition is like that; when you have friends or relatives abroad, you often go visiting, have a look, and if you find a valuable activity to develop, you settle. Lebanese people adapt very easily and as we do not look for problems, problems do not come to us. When Zaidane met his wife, who was living in Mauritania, he decided to move and start another life there. Before settling, I already knew the context, as I went there on holidays a few times. Mauritania is a developing country with a very low population. Compared to the neighbouring countries, it is extremely rich in resources, especially fish and iron. What is missing is the expertise; so those who arrive here with a luggage filled with human or financial capital have the possibility to develop activities of various kinds. When I first arrived, 25 years ago, Mauritania was quite different from now. Nouakchott was much smaller, there were fewer buildings and infrastructure, the population was poorer and the restaurant industry was underdeveloped, so we thought that opening a restaurant could be a good idea, we could bring something new. Today, Zaidan and his wife own one of the most renowned restaurants in Nouakchott. They have trained a whole team of chefs and waiters who have been working with them for some years and have become real professionals. That is what movement brings. It allows change and progress. Unfortunately, nowadays, when we talk about migration we refer to it as something negative. Migration is seen as a consequence and part of a bigger problem, while before it was accepted as normal, it was seen more as an opportunity. What is the problem in finding ones luck elsewhere? Mauritania, for example, has a lot to learn from the migrants who travel here. All the knowledge that those people bring allows the country to develop. Everywhere is like that. Take Lebanon, for example. It is a country that owes a lot to the diaspora. Its secret is the Lebanese who first left during the 50s and have been enriching the country with the experiences gained abroad. Even though Zaidan now lives far from his country of origin, he has managed to integrate successfully and become integral part of this country. Migration can be a great resource for both origin and destination country, supporting economic development by allowing the transfer of knowledge and skills."
1006	Zaina	Kuwait	Egypt	M	A	far	24809	3609	L	im	female	"My name is Zaina, Im from an Egyptian father, a Syrian mother, born in Canada and raised in Kuwait; so I'm quite the cocktail. I came back to Egypt at the age of 18 to attend university. My choice was in a way or another affected by the fact that I wanted to experience life here and create my solid ground. Five years later I still live here and managed to convince my mom to move back here with me. I suppose its evident that I love this country. I must admit that when I first moved to Egypt I felt a bit out of place for multiple reasons. I wasn't used to the amount of dirt and traffic there is in this country. My knowledge about the Egyptian culture was very little. My Egyptian accent wasn't so Egyptian, which made it easier for people to make fun of me. With time things got better and I found it easy to adapt. The thing I miss most about Kuwait, the country I was raised in, is family and lifestyle. I like how everything used to be so easy to do without much effort. Basically getting pampered was easy. However, I visit a lot as I still have family and friends there. Facing mix of cultures is something Im used to because my parents are from two different cultures. It is something that doesn't bother me. On the contrary I think it is an added value because I understand different dialects and have a great understanding of different cultures. Having a Syrian mother is enough, I didn't need to live in a different country in order to feel the difference in culture, up to this day people make fun of my accent. Home is where my family and friends are. Home is where I feel a sense of belonging. Home for me is in Egypt. Yet I still manage to stay in touch with family through todays technology, its wonderful, thats all I'm going to say! I want to help it improve, become developed and more stable. I want to see the country prosper."
1007	Zainah	Malaysia	United Kingdom	I	E	far	10402	40718	E	im	female	I am a mother of three children and we have lived in the UK for 13 years now. I have worked and contributed to the economy. Yet, day in and day out I am told I am burden to society and local services. I am also reminded each day that my religion equals terrorism. So my daily quest is to live with my community and to bring up my children as well rounded individuals amidst this rhetoric and media nonsense. Politicians dont help either. I choose to contribute to my community not because i want to disprove the myth of the dreaded migrant but because I simply want to. It doesnt take a genius to recognise good but it sadly takes very little to bring out racism. Unless you are a migrant you can't imagine being far away from your Country, being the odd one out, at work, at the supermarket, etc. Equally I try to understand people in smaller cities like cardiff who have only had migration on a large scale in the past 20 years or so. At the end of the day we all have issues, so why not come together and ease those troubles. As a local, why not make migrants feel at home. As migrants, open your hearts and minds to a new culture. We must realise that we have more in common than differences. At the end of the day we all love our parents, love our children, love our family , so love is strong in us, so why not love our neighbour(s) no matter where they are from.
1008	Zakariya	Syrian Arab Republic	Denmark	M	E	far	890	61477	H	im	male	My name is Zakariya. I am 26 years old. I am from Homs in Syria. I live in Denmark now with two of my younger brothers, Issam and Mohammed. Before the war my family was together. Now they are all over the world. That is what the war did, but I am happy because they are all safe. I hope we will get to be together all of us again, like we used to be in Ramadan. We had everything in Syria. We had two dairy factories. In my home, we had cats, dogs, birds, horses. My mother would make bread on the terrace. It was so delicious. She was very good at that. We had everything we wanted. But it was all destroyed. We dont have a home now. We dont have anything. All I can think is that at least we are safe. In 2012 my familys factories were taken. We couldnt do anything. You cant say anything. Its your life, you want to protect it. I was at university in Turkey, but after my family lost the factories we couldnt afford it anymore. So I had to quit. After that I didnt know what to do. I tried to find any work to survive. I felt like I should do something to help in Syria. I wanted to help my friends and my family – and all the Syrian people are my family. I drove ambulances and delivered medicine and food to people. I bought the food from the local market in Syria and not in Turkey, because it is good for the Syrian people that we buy from them. I tried to give people the most important food – like rice and olive oil, sugar and tea. The first time I was back in Syria, it was really hard to see. Many buildings were collapsed, people were poor. Its really hard to see these people who dont have anything. Sometimes you feel that you want to cry, you cant imagine. Some people dont have anything to eat. Its really so hard, especially with the kids. It was a surprise for me to see the people there. In the end, many of them are happy. They were still smiling because they are happy to be alive. They joke, they smile, they laugh. When I was in their homes, we would hear bombs. They can tell the distance of the bombs just by the sound, and they would say dont worry, its far away and keep joking. The first time I was delivered food I was so nervous. What should I say? I wanted to show them that I am exactly like them. I didnt know how to knock on the door or how to tell them to take the food. It is hard to say how they felt when they received the food – they were happy and ashamed at the same time, and so was I. Giving food meant a lot to me. When you give food to people, they feel alive and can do something. Food is the most important gift in life because it is life. I started my journey in July 2015 because I couldnt help in Syria anymore. I couldnt get a job and I couldnt study. I needed a paper from my university and I couldnt get it because I couldnt pay. My whole life stopped at that moment. Thats why I chose Europe to start my life again. I travelled to Izmir first and I found a smuggler to go to Mytilini on the Greek Island of Lesbos. I asked him how many we would be. He said 20. He said the boat was old, but good and big. When we got to the coast, I could see we were about 35 people and 10 children. The boat was about 8 metres long, and we were very close to the water. I wasnt afraid for myself but I was scared for my brothers. That was all I cared about. The smuggler pointed at a light in the distance, and said that is where we are going. He told me to take the engine and I did. Then he jumped off and swam back to the shore. The boat was going very slowly because we were so many people, and the engine was small and old. Every 10 minutes it stopped and we had to start it again. In the end, the trip took almost 10 hours. People had told me Denmark is a good country to go to because the people are very friendly. People told me that the life here is good, that you can feel safe and that you have freedom. When we got to Europe, I started the travel to Denmark with my two brothers. Now we are living in a shared house in Solrød Kommune. Everything here is down to luck – its luck that decides where you end up staying, when your interview with the police is and how long youll wait, what your interview is like and who your translator is, and what commune you end up in. I am not Danish and it hurts me to be a refugee. We are better now of course but how should we continue? As a refugee, people look at you like you are less than them.but I am not. I was rich, I was studying, I had a job, I had everything. I am like you. A war started. It is not my fault and I am not less than you are. People should understand that but they dont.
1009	Zarni	Thailand	United States	I	N	far	7189	63123	H	im	female	"My parents migrated from Burma after an uprising in 1988, but even though Im ethically Burmese, I have never been to Myanmar. I was born and raised in Thailand. I studied in Thai schools from Kindergarten all the way through high school. I found it hard to make friends with other kids, and I was afraid of telling other kids that I am Burmese because I thought they might discriminate against me. I had different skin color, mindset and language from everyone else. My classmates did not want to play with me and preferred to make friends with other Thai kids. Im not sure whether it was because Im Burmese or that we did not look alike. However, a big change came for me during high school. Those who avoided playing with me became my close friends. I think it was because they didnt take our differences so seriously anymore. I myself found that I have more similarities with Thai people than differences. Moreover, my friends and I did activities together; Im a singer who sings in Thai, and we set up a band, occasionally joining contests. In my last year of school, I was elected as president of the student council. This is one of my most wonderful memories I have of school. Im so proud of it because I am a migrant and at the time I didn't have an official nationality, but my friends and other students trusted me to be their leader. Im really thankful for this. Im not afraid of telling anybody that Im a migrant anymore. I think it is good to be honest with both others and myself. After graduating from high school, I sought opportunities to study abroad and finally got a scholarship from a university in the United States In 2016 I started studying at the University of Maine in the Biochemistry department. I plan to continue studying as a doctor after I complete this degree. Staying in the United States has introduced me to lots of new experiences; it is fun and enjoyable. However, it does not feel like home. Even though I am not originally Thai, I feel that Thailand is my home. I like Thailand, especially the food — its very delicious. Therefore, after graduating from the University of Maine as a doctor, I plan to come back to Thailand and work at Chiang Mais Ram Hospital. I want to encourage other migrants to follow their dreams. Even if youre a migrant or a person without a nationality, it doesnt mean you can't do what you want with your life. We can study, we can work and we can contribute too many good things to society. Its all up to you. Please dont give up and one day I believe you will get it. I waited for 19 years and now Im so happy to say that Im Thai."
1010	Zeini Mohamed	Mali	Ghana	A	A	close	856	2206	E	im	male	In old times, it was Kumasi, in Ghana. That was our Eldorado. All Malians who went to Ghana brought back a lot of money to their families. People didnt need to cross the Sahara or risk their life along the migration road to become rich. But today things have changed. The situation has become difficult. People no longer love each other, borders are sealed. In old times, life in Mali was sweet as sugar, but nowadays it is more bitter than chili pepper. Because of conflicts, says Ag Zeini Mohamed, a 115-year-old Malian. This elderly native of Ansogo, a district in Northern Malis Gao region, knows of what he speaks. Mr. Ag Zeini recently was assisted to return home from Burkina Faso — at his request. Its now been nearly 70 years since he left home. Since May, Mohamed has been accommodated in a partner host centre of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Bamako. Im 119 years old, but officially its 115, because thats what is written on my ID card, he says, brandishing an ancient document pulled from a black bag carefully placed next to him. His face says a lot about his age. Yet, despite his white beard, Ag Zeini Mohamed looks strong and solid. Surely, it is some holdover from his long military career that makes him stand at attention when visitors come, intrigued by his age. Suddenly Mohamed gets up! Arms hanging straight down, head erect, face squared to the front, calls out his regimental number. Rest! If I am still solid, it is because I walked a lot when I was young. I used to travel from village to village, on foot. I havent eaten salt for a very long time and I like rice with tomato sauce, he says. The military? Mohamed knows it well. He fought for the French Army during the Second World War. After that he was involved in conflicts worldwide, including those in Indochina and Biafra. In 38 years of military service, this centenarian — who presents himself as the memory bank of six Malian generations — has travelled much of the world. I didnt know my father well, he was a marabout {religious sage}, Mohamed explained. He died when I was young. I have seven daughters, two of whom are married. My wife passed away. In Ansogo, he had been living with the son of a former Army mate. From Ansongo, we went to Togo, Ghana, and then Indochina. We were ten persons. The other nine lost their lives in the various battles, he recalls. When some countries in West African gained independence, old Mohamed went to Lomé, Togo, where he raised cattle, under the protection of a local politician. But once the politician died, Mohamed had to leave the country and went to neighbouring Burkina Faso where he stayed for 15 years. Eight years ago, he returned to Mali. Then, as Malis fragile security declined and its economy worsened, Mohamed decided to return to Burkina Faso. He went to make money. But as what? He wont tell. Weeks passed. Mohamed realized this time it would have been better if he had remained in Mali. He decided to return for good. He visited Malis Ouagadougou embassy for assistance. He was referred to IOM, which in 2017 began implementing the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration to assist migrants stranded along migration routes. Mohamed was flabbergasted. He had never received anything from anyone in his entire life, and certainly not at the age of 115 would he have expected such a thing! And yet, just a few days later, IOM in Burkina Faso stepped up to help. After first ensuring that Mohamed was fit to travel, IOM assisted his return to Mali. He travelled first to Bamako. There he registered at a transit centre managed by an IOM partner. Today, Mohamed stays in the centre where he performs his prayers and recites his rosary, waiting for his flight back to Gao. Mohamed looks at his phone he put next to him. The numbers on the phone screen are small, I cant see them well, but I still pick up the calls! he said. One thing is certain for him: I want to stay in Mali. But I cant do anything alone, I need help, he concludes. IOM in Mali is now working to organize his trip to his home village where he will receive assistance.
1011	Ziad	Iraq	Iraq	M	M	close	4146	4146	E	hc	male	Ziad is a young man from Ninewa governorate, who witnessed the brutality of ISIL terrorism. When ISIL first arrived, they were nice. But it wasnt long before they became horrible. They arrested my cousin who was a car mechanic because he refused to fix one of their cars. They wouldnt release him, they wouldnt even negotiate with us! After several days ISIL hanged him. And for what? Not fixing a car. My mom decided we had to leave and come to Haj Ali because many bombs hit close to our house when the Iraqi military and ISIL started to fight. When we left, ISIL interrogated us because they suspected us of trying to escape, but my brother convinced them we werent. Once we made it to Haj Ali, we were transferred to Dibaga camp. IOM psychosocial teams met Ziad just after he had received news that his uncle had been executed by ISIL—a new grief to compound the already severe losses he and his family had gone through. Ziad was very excited to start playing football, one of the activities organized by IOM as part of a program to work with young people to cope with bereavement, grief and stress.
1012	Ziad	Syrian Arab Republic	Jordan	M	M	close	890	4283	E	im	male	My name is Ziad. I grew up in a small village of Al Hajah in Syria. Thank you for reading my letter. If you were here in Zaatari refugee camp with me, I would welcome you into my home. It means so much to share my story with you. These days, I live in a refugee camp in Jordan where I keep busy by working as a guard at WFP food distribution points, and by helping to fix things around the camp. My life now is very different to my life before the conflict started. There was a sense of familiarity at home in Syria. I lived among relatives and neighbours that I knew well. I used to work as a farmer, living and eating off the sweat of my brow. I had land where I grew vegetables and I had confidence that my children were safe and among family. Here in the refugee camp, you have to fend for yourself. Leaving your home country is a very hard decision. I knew that when I first came to Jordan I was going to feel estranged, so I use poetry as a way to cope with my experiences. I have written several poems since I arrived here. At home, I had a notebook full of the poems I had written. Because of the circumstances, I wasnt able to bring it with me. Life is hard here - work is scarce and the assistance we get barely covers our basic needs until the end of each month. The only items I have are a drill for doing DIY work around the camp, and a rababa, a string instrument which I use to recite my poetry. Back in Syria, I used to love writing poems about romance, values and chivalry. Since I arrived here in Zaatari, all my poems are now about my longing to go home.
1013	Zina	Iraq	Jordan	M	M	close	4146	4283	E	im	female	"Until 2010, Zina still hoped for a peaceful life in Baghdad. But when a car bomb targeted a television station next to her house, she knew it was time to leave Iraq. I had just left my house to go to work when I heard a huge explosion. All I could think about was my son, still asleep in the house. He was only thirteen years old at the time. He got injured and was unable to move for weeks. I decided I had to take my children out of the country. Jordan seemed like the closest and easiest option. So we moved to Amman. Life was difficult at first. I was the only one who could find a job and it was poorly paid. Everything was much more expensive there. While education was free in Iraq, we had to pay to send our children to good schools here. Eventually, my husband had to go back to Baghdad. He wanted us to stay here because he knew our children were safer. And its true! Their future is brighter here. They have friends and are able to lead a normal life; go to the movies and the mall. Back in Baghdad, if I called my children on the phone and didnt receive an immediate answer, I thought they had been killed or kidnapped. Our neighbors understood our situation and were very welcoming. The Jordanian and Iraqi cultures are not so different, so Id say we have settled in well. I am now 48 years old and my children are in university! I work as a translator for an organization that helps Iraqis. My job is a blessing. In my spare time, my friends and I help the Iraqi migrants who are less established here. I will never forget how hard it was to be new in the country and I want to do everything in my power to help others in this situation."
1014	Zina	Jordan	Kuwait	M	M	close	4283	24809	H	im	female	I am a Jordanian citizen who lived in Jordan for the first 26 years of my life, until I left my home country to work in Kuwait. The office where I used to work in Jordan offered to relocated me to their branch in Kuwait. At first, I thought I would work there for a year, two maximum, and return to Jordan afterwards. I agreed to move because I thought it would be a great experience to work abroad, learn how to be independent and do things by myself. When I arrived in Kuwait I generally liked the atmosphere, but I was hesitant to mingle with the community. However, I haven't faced any difficulty in adjusting to the local culture and traditions, because I grew up in an Arab country which almost shares the same traditions — maybe to a less conservative degree. I now feel that both Jordan and Kuwait are home to me, but each in a different way. This might be due to the fact that the lifestyle in each country has its pros and cons, and I enjoy living or experiencing certain things in one country which I can't do in the other. Still, family gatherings back home, the mountains of Amman, the red fertile soil of its spacious lands in the suburbs and Amman's cityscape are the things I miss the most.
1015	Zouhair	Morocco	Belgium	A	E	far	3108	45028	H	im	male	"My family is from Asilah, a small village in the north west of Morocco. My father, who is a car mechanic, arrived in Belgium with his boss to buy a car in 1974 and decided to stay here. He married my mother in 1977, and she joined him in Brussels. Except for two cousins, all my family is still in Morocco. Since I was young, I have returned every year to spend two months in Asilah. This was important, as it allowed me to stay connected to my Moroccan roots and understand the Moroccan culture. I started to play football when I was 8 years old. First I played only in my neighborhood, but my father decided to put me in an official team. I later played for a team called 'Etoile Marocaine' which was a regional football team created by the Moroccan community. I played with them for two years before being signed to a first division football team when I was seventeen. Football helped me to find my place in the Belgian community. When I started to play, the team was a place where different cultures were mixed; there were Belgian players as well as Congolese, Turks and Italians. The football pitch was often a place where you could find people from the different waves of immigration that Belgium has experienced. It taught me from a very young age that we are living in a multi-cultural community and that you do not stick to one culture—you can be Belgian and Moroccan. When I was around 30, I signed back with Etoile Marocain and had a special role in the team. I was captain but also a mentor for the young, mostly Moroccan players. I tried to help them to understand their place in the community, how they should behave, how to avoid the temptations of criminality and so on. Those young people have plenty of potential, but unfortunately lack of guidance and often fall into the trap of poverty. With my MBA in hand, I will be looking for opportunities in the Middle Eastern markets. By being fluent in two languages I want to create linkages between people, markets, cultures."
1016	Zuhal	Turkey	Belgium	M	E	far	8538	45028	H	im	female	My mother moved from a small village on the countryside in Turkey straight to Belgium. When she asked her mother how Belgium looks like, her mother said there would be a lot of lighter skinned people with blonde hair. When they arrived in Istanbul to take the plane, my mum saw women with dyed blond hair everywhere and asked: are we in Belgium already? I was born here. For me, coming from a small town in Belgium, moving to Brussels was a temporary decision that turned into a permanent and, I must say, great one. I feel that people in Brussels are more welcoming, tolerant and friendly. Initially, she did not identify as a migrant, because, in theory, she never made an active choice to move: others see me as a migrant, so I started to look at myself in a similar way. I personally consider Belgium as my home because I have a house, a job and my family here. But to be completely honest neither Belgium nor Turkey is really home for me. I feel that in Belgium people consider me to be a foreigner and in Turkey they tend to see me as a tourist. I am quite a coffee addict, so I really miss the Turkish coffee, the food, the nature but most of all the hospitality and the feeling that you are always welcome. I believe that we can learn so much just by going conversing with one another. I witness the values of those exchanges almost every day in my classrooms. The pupils learn from me, from each other and likewise, I learn from them. I am mostly interested in the traditions and customs of the new places that I visit. I recently went to Zimbabwe to volunteer and there, for example, I just loved listening to the stories from local people. By listening, I realized that the way they raise their children is incredibly similar to the way I was raised as well. Who would have thought?
1017	Zulema	Bolivia	Argentina	L	L	close	3133	8476	E	im	female	"Zulema was born in 1961 in Tarabuco, state of Chuquisaca, Bolivia. She studied law and worked tirelessly as Advocate of the poor in the Superior Court of the Judicial District of Chuquisaca, Investigating Magistrate and President of the Assembly of Human Rights, Regional Yacuiba. Accompanied by her three children, she arrived in Buenos Aires in 2001 to meet her husband who was studying there. Zulema remembers that the first moments were quite hard…things here were very bad and I wasn´t used to just doing house chores. Then she started to meet other migrant women and learn about their situation in Argentina. The migrants reality was rather different at that time. There were many difficulties to access documentation and the existing Law of Migrant was retrograde. So, with several associations of migrants and Non-Governmental Organizations, we began to participate in public hearings to change the law. For Zulema and other migrant women, the situation changed notably after the enactment of the Migration Law N0 25.871 in 2003. In 2006, Zulema decided to create the Civil Association Yanapacuna, meaning let´s help each other in Quechua dialect, whose main purpose is to offer legal counseling to migrants. We help them and talk about how they are and about the labor exploitation situations they face. Since 2014, IOM Argentina has supported the National Encounter of Immigrant Leaders in Argentina, which gathers migrant leaders from various Organizations to debate the advances and challenges of the national migration policy. Zulema was part of the Political Committee Organizer of the Second Encounter which took place in May this year in Córdoba. In the second encounter, we decided to work on a specific issue every day. Political Rights of migrant men and women, the first day; Migration Law and Citizenship, the second day; and Bilateral and Multilateral Agreements in Argentina, the last day. This Second Encounter has been successful since migrants throughout the country come together to debate their problems or rights and especially The National Law of Migrations N°25.871,which is still unknown by many migrants. This type of spaces encourages us to keep collaborating among our organizations and push for progress."
